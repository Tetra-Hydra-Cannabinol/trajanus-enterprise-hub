==============================================================================

0:00 when you plot multiple Series in a chart
0:02 the labels can end up overlapping other
0:05 data which is less than ideal now we can
0:08 avoid this with custom chart label
0:10 positions assigned to a ghost series it
0:12 sounds scary but it's dead easy okay
0:15 well that was two puns in one sentence
0:18 anyhow let's take a
0:20 look first I need to delete these labels
0:23 because they're assigned to the actual
0:25 Series so just selecting them and press
0:27 the delete key now all I need to do is
0:30 is add a column to my table for the
0:32 labels and we want to find the maximum
0:36 of the Target and the actual now because
0:39 my chart is linked to this table it's
0:42 automatically included this new series
0:44 so that saves me a step I'm going to
0:47 select this new series and add labels
0:51 but I want to click on the arrow and go
0:53 down to more options now I want to
0:56 deselect show leader lines and value and
0:59 and I want to select a value from CES
1:01 now when I check this it opens the
1:04 dialogue box asking me to select the
1:06 data range so I want the labels for the
1:08 actual Series so I'm going to select the
1:11 actual in the table and click okay so
1:14 now we have the labels for the actual
1:18 assigned to this new series called
1:20 labels all I need to do now is make this
1:22 new series a ghost so I'm going to
1:24 select the columns and on the paint
1:27 bucket in the format data series pane
1:29 I'm going to choose no fill and no line
1:32 for the border now we have a little bit
1:34 more tidying up to do I've now got an
1:37 extra item in my legend for the labels
1:40 so I'm going to left click once and left
1:42 click again to select the labels item
1:45 and press delete we don't need that now
1:48 my readers might be confused about which
1:50 series these labels relate to so I'm
1:53 going to color code them to match the
1:55 column color for the actual so up on the
1:58 Home tab this is the color for my column
2:01 but it's a bit pale when it's in a font
2:03 which is quite fine so I'm going to
2:05 select this color up here it's a little
2:07 bit darker but you can't really tell
2:09 looking at it on the face of the chart
2:12 and it's just going to make it that bit
2:13 easier for my reader so there you have
2:16 your own custom chart label positions
2:18 assigned to a ghost series now you can
2:20 also use ghost series to fix the axis
2:23 height which is handy when you have
2:25 multiple charts that you want plotted
2:27 based on the same vertical axis scale
