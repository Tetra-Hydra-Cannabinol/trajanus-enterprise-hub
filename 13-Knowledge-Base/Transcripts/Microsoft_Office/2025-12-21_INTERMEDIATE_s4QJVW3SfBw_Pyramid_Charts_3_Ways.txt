0:00 pyramid charts are useful for
0:02 visualizing demographic data across
0:04 multiple categories they're easy to
0:06 build using bar charts or conditional
0:08 formatting but there are a few rules you
0:10 must follow depending on the approach
0:12 you choose let's take a look the easiest
0:15 way to create a pyramid chart is with a
0:18 bar chart the trick is to convert the
0:20 values for the leftand series to
0:22 negatives so they sit on the left side
0:24 of the vertical axis in this example
0:27 I'll put the male data on the left and I
0:29 can easily convert the values to
0:31 negatives using paste special I need to
0:34 enter minus one into an empty cell and
0:36 then contrl + C to copy it select the
0:39 values that I want to convert paste
0:43 special and then in here I want values
0:46 and
0:48 multiply now the values are all negative
0:51 I can delete the minus one in this cell
0:53 it's done its job I'll select the data
0:57 and then
0:58 insert and then we just want the 2D bar
1:02 chart first thing I want to do is set
1:04 the series to overlap one another so
1:07 with any part of the chart selected
1:09 control one to open the formatting pane
1:12 let me bring it over here so it's beside
1:13 the chart here I want the series overlap
1:16 to be 100% and I'm also going to change
1:19 the Gap width to 50% that just makes the
1:21 bars a little wider now you notice that
1:25 the vertical axis is incorrectly
1:28 displaying just number instead of the
1:30 year and that's because the year has
1:32 been picked up as a series so let's fix
1:34 that I'm going to right click the chart
1:36 select
1:38 data here I want to remove the year and
1:42 for the access labels here I'm going to
1:43 edit it and pick up the years you can
1:47 see in the chart behind it's now
1:48 displaying
1:50 correctly you'll notice that my pyramid
1:53 is upside down and there's a couple of
1:55 ways you can fix this either by sorting
1:57 the data in descending order order or
2:00 you can set the chart axis to display
2:03 the categories in reverse order when you
2:06 do this then you also have to switch the
2:09 horizontal axis so that the labels are
2:12 now positioned high now it's
2:15 counterintuitive what you've got to keep
2:17 in mind is that a bar chart is a column
2:20 chart on its side essentially so in this
2:22 case high is actually low I also want to
2:26 position my vertical axis to the left so
2:30 let's go in and change the position of
2:32 this to low now notice that we have
2:35 negative values for the male side of the
2:37 pyramid and that's because our source
2:39 data are negatives but that was just a
2:41 trick to get the bars to sit on the left
2:43 hand side of the chart so let's change
2:45 the number format of the horizontal
2:48 axis and we can use a custom number
2:51 format and I've already got some in my
2:54 list I'm also going to scale it to
2:56 Millions so select this one here if you
2:58 don't have this format in your list you
3:01 can type the format in here and then add
3:04 it I'm also going to change the colors
3:07 of my male and female series I'm going
3:09 to avoid the stereotypical colors and
3:12 instead for male I'm going to go with
3:14 this green and for female I'm going to
3:17 go with
3:19 orange let's give the chart a title and
3:22 I'm done so you can see it's fairly easy
3:24 to build a pyramid chart using a regular
3:26 old bar chart however what if you prefer
3:29 the vertical access labels to sit in the
3:31 middle of the bars let's take a look
3:34 again with this technique The Source
3:36 data requires the left hand series to be
3:39 negative values which they already are
3:41 here I'll start by selecting the data
3:44 insert and then I want the 2D bar chart
3:48 let's bring it up here into this space
3:50 and I'll make it a little bigger I'll
3:52 start with the vertical axis we're going
3:54 to position them in reverse
3:57 order let's switch this now so that
4:01 labels are high we'll set the number
4:05 formatting as well while I'm
4:07 here again I want a custom number
4:10 format and this time I'm just going to
4:13 pick this format the first part is the
4:16 positive value format and the second
4:18 part is the negative value format notice
4:21 they're identical I'm going to change
4:23 the Gap width just to make the bars a
4:26 bit wider I don't need to worry about
4:28 the series overlapping you'll see in a
4:30 moment it doesn't affect the chart I'm
4:33 going to enter a space in the chart
4:35 title I want the chart title to be blank
4:37 but I don't want to delete it because I
4:39 want to retain the space above the plot
4:41 area to put in a manual title later so
4:44 I'm just going to type in a space and
4:46 that hides the title in this one I'd
4:48 like my Legend to sit at the top so
4:51 let's change that now I'm ready to
4:54 duplicate this chart so with it selected
4:56 contrl D to duplicate now I've got two
5:00 two one here and one here I want to
5:03 delete the female series from this chart
5:06 on the left and in this one delete the
5:10 mail Series so just selecting the bars
5:11 and pressing the delete key gets rid of
5:14 it let's make them not so
5:19 big and I'll move this
5:22 over now I want to remove the outline
5:25 and the fill from each of the charts you
5:27 have to do this one at a time on the
5:29 formatting pane I want no fill and no
5:33 outline and then this one the
5:36 same I don't want the vertical axis in
5:39 this chart so we're just going to remove
5:41 it no primary vertical axis what this
5:45 allows me to do is position the charts
5:47 on top of one another now what I want to
5:49 do is line up the vertical grid lines so
5:53 that they're in the same place in each
5:55 chart and I'm doing this so that the
5:58 scale is the same and That's essential
6:00 to being able to compare these charts
6:02 light for light let's just move this
6:04 over so I've got some more room for my
6:06 two charts the next thing I want to do
6:09 is make sure that the horizontal axis in
6:11 each chart is the same so here the
6:14 minimum maximum major and minor and then
6:18 if I click on this one they're exactly
6:21 the same the only difference being is
6:22 now the minimum is zero instead of the
6:25 maximum that's obviously because this is
6:27 the positive data and this one's the
6:30 negative data if they're not the same
6:32 then you need to hard key the values to
6:35 ensure they're the same otherwise you
6:36 can't compare like for like and That's
6:38 essential in making sure that your
6:40 charts convey the true picture of the
6:43 data lastly let's insert a text box for
6:47 the chart
6:50 title I'm just going to format that font
6:52 in a shade of gray we'll make it a bit
6:57 bigger and a bit wider
7:03 let's Center it in that text box and
7:05 then I'll get rid of the shape outline
7:07 on the text box so it just sits above
7:09 the chart you might also like to move
7:12 the Legends over so that they're aligned
7:15 above the data so there you have a
7:18 pyramid chart with the versical axis in
7:20 the center now another way we can create
7:23 pyramid chart is with conditional
7:26 formatting with conditional formatting
7:28 data bars there's no need to convert one
7:30 series to negative values we can simply
7:33 select the first series and then on the
7:35 Home tab conditional formatting data
7:38 bars and I'll choose this solid fill we
7:42 need to edit the format so we're going
7:43 to manage
7:44 rules and then I'll bring the rule
7:47 manager over and double click the rule
7:49 to open it and here I can edit it so
7:53 here I want the maximum to be based on a
7:56 formula and that formula is the maximum
7:59 of both the male and female values
8:02 that's going to ensure that the axes on
8:05 both sides are the same scale so you
8:07 want to be comparing like with like I'm
8:09 going to change the color to this green
8:12 shade and the bar Direction here I want
8:15 it to run right to left and click okay
8:19 and okay and we've done the male side
8:22 all I need to do is repeat that for the
8:24 female so again data bars solid fill
8:28 we'll go in and edit the
8:30 rule here again I want formula and it's
8:34 the same
8:35 formula maximum of both
8:38 series and we'll go with this orange
8:41 color I don't need to change the bar
8:43 Direction click okay and okay and we're
8:46 done now you'll notice that conditional
8:48 formatting data bars don't have a
8:50 horizontal axis so you may prefer to
8:52 leave the numbers visible in the cells I
8:55 like to align them close to the center
8:57 line but it's important that the numbers
8:59 themselves are still right aligned to
9:01 one another so we can do this using the
9:03 indent button and just click it until it
9:05 moves across let's align the
9:09 label and for the male series I'm just
9:12 going to bump it slightly to the left
9:14 just to take it away from that vertical
9:16 axis so that the male and female values
9:19 are equidistance from that vertical axis
9:21 and it's as simple as that now you may
9:24 prefer to have the vertical axis labels
9:26 in the center of the bars in which case
9:29 I'll just copy this and paste it over
9:31 here and then we'll move them so I'm
9:33 just going to hold down shift and left
9:36 click and drag and you can see the
9:38 vertical bar where it's going to insert
9:40 the values insert them this one here
9:44 these columns are slightly different
9:45 width so let's reduce the indentation
9:49 and then we have our pyramid chart with
9:50 the vertical axis labels in the center
9:53 now with both of these charts it's
9:55 really important that the column width
9:57 is the same so you just right click
9:59 and make sure that it's showing a number
10:01 there if it's not showing a number there
10:03 then that will indicate that one of the
10:04 columns is slightly different so you can
10:06 just type in the value that you want
10:08 click okay when you have two columns
10:11 side by side you can simply resize them
10:13 with a left click of your mouse so there
10:17 you have three different ways to create
10:19 pyramid charts in
10:21 Excel I hope you found these techniques
