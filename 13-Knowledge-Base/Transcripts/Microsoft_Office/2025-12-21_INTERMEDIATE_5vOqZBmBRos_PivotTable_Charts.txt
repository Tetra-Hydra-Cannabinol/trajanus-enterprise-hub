0:00 pivot tables are a great way to
0:02 summarize your data but pivot charts can
0:05 be a pain in the neck because they're
0:07 not as customizable as regular Excel
0:09 charts they only play nice with data
0:12 from one pivot table and pivot charts
0:14 aren't available for all types of charts
0:16 so sunbursts scatter charts histograms
0:20 and waterfalls don't come with a pivot
0:22 chart equivalent but pivot tables make
0:24 our life easy and slices are cool so in
0:27 this video I'm going to show you how to
0:29 trick regular charts into using pivot
0:31 tables as their Source data so you can
0:34 have the best of both
0:37 worlds in this file I have two Source
0:40 data tables one for actual sales and one
0:43 for budgeted sales now I want to
0:46 summarize this data using pivot tables
0:48 but I want the flexibility of regular
0:50 charts now there are three approaches we
0:52 can use the first one is to build
0:54 another table that references the pivot
0:57 tables and feeds the chart I call it the
0:59 manual chart table this approach is
1:02 useful if the data in the pivot tables
1:04 isn't organized in the same way as you
1:06 can see here with the categories in
1:08 different orders or if the order can't
1:10 be relied upon to always be the same in
1:13 both pivot tables so I'm going to start
1:16 by simply grabbing the row labels from
1:18 one of the pivot tables this one here
1:20 will do it's already in alphabetical
1:22 order and we'll just drag it down next I
1:26 need to grab the actual figures and I'm
1:29 going to use the get pivot data function
1:31 that automatically populates when you
1:33 select a values field in a pivot table
1:36 but I'm going to replace this hard key
1:38 label for beverages with a reference to
1:40 the cell containing the category and
1:42 that'll allow me just to copy it down
1:44 with a double click of the fill handle
1:47 let's do the same for the budget amount
1:49 replacing Seafood with beverages that
1:52 way it doesn't matter what row this
1:54 formula is on it's going to always find
1:56 the beverages value from the pivot table
1:59 contain containing the budget
2:01 figures again let's double click the
2:03 fill handle to copy it down so there's
2:05 my table for my chart now all I need to
2:07 do is insert the chart and I'll go with
2:10 a regular column chart let me bring it
2:12 over here and I'll make it a bit bigger
2:15 I'll quickly do some formatting so
2:16 clicking on one of the columns I'm going
2:18 to control one to open the format Pane
2:22 and here I want series overlap
2:25 100% And then I'm just going to format
2:28 the column these are The Columns for the
2:30 budget amounts so I want no
2:33 fill and I'm going to give them a border
2:36 let's pick a color that's going to stand
2:38 out and I'll make it a bit thicker next
2:42 I'll do a little bit more formatting
2:43 quickly cuz I can't help myself let's
2:45 get rid of the title and we'll move the
2:47 legend to the top so with this method I
2:50 can refresh the pivot tables and any
2:52 changes to the values are going to
2:54 automatically feed through to my manual
2:56 chart table and then through to the
2:58 Chart now I just want to show you
3:00 another technique if you have Dynamic
3:02 arrays then we can use some different
3:06 formulas and I'll move the chart down a
3:08 little bit instead of just referencing
3:11 one of these category label fields in
3:13 the pivot table I can use the filter
3:16 function to grab this list and I can
3:19 extend past the end to allow for growth
3:22 in that list of categories I want to
3:25 include the labels in these cells that
3:29 aren't
3:30 empty and then I simply close
3:32 parentheses and press enter because it's
3:34 a dynamic array it spills the results
3:37 now as a precaution I'm going to wrap it
3:40 in the sort function which will make
3:41 sure that this list that feeds my chart
3:44 is always sorted even if the pivot table
3:46 isn't now all I need to do is find the
3:49 actual and budget figures and I can use
3:52 the dynamic array function X lookup to
3:54 find this list of values notice it puts
3:58 in The Spill array of operator the pound
4:00 sign and that means that if this list
4:03 grows I don't need to edit my xook up it
4:06 will automatically grow as well so it's
4:08 looking up the
4:10 category in the pivot table here now I
4:13 want to extend past the end to allow for
4:16 growth and it's returning the actual I'm
4:19 going to press enter and it spills all I
4:22 need to do is repeat that for the
4:25 budget and I'm looking up the budget
4:27 table allowing for growth
4:30 and returning the sum of
4:32 budget so the benefit of the dynamic
4:35 array formulas is that if the pivot
4:37 table expands with new categories the
4:39 dynamic array formulas will
4:41 automatically pick up the new rows now
4:44 method two is useful if the order of the
4:48 data is identical in each pivot table
4:50 and you can be certain it always will be
4:53 like with months of the year that we
4:55 have here or if you only have one pivot
4:57 table that you need to feed your chart
4:59 with you can then skip the manual chart
5:01 table example we just looked at and
5:03 simply reference the pivot tables using
5:05 Dynamic named ranges now we need three
5:08 Dynamic named Rangers for the chart one
5:10 for the actual series one for the budget
5:13 series and one for the aess labels so
5:16 via the formulas tab I'm going to define
5:18 a new name we'll set up the chart actual
5:21 first now you can use offset or index to
5:24 create a dynamic named range I'm going
5:27 to go with offset if you're not familiar
5:29 with offset make sure you download the
5:31 Excel file and the link is in the video
5:34 description in there there'll be links
5:36 where you can learn more about offset so
5:38 the first argument for offset is the
5:40 reference well January's actual value
5:43 will be my starting reference the next
5:45 argument is how many rows from that cell
5:48 D5 do I want to move down well I don't
5:49 want to move down any so I'm going to
5:51 skip that argument the next argument is
5:54 how many columns do I want to move
5:56 across I don't want to move across any I
5:58 want to stay there that's the first sell
6:00 in my range so I'll skip that as well
6:02 then I need to tell offset how big I
6:04 want this range how many rows so I'm
6:06 going to use the count a function to
6:09 count the number of months in my pivot
6:12 table and remember I want to allow for
6:14 growth so we'll extend down to row 30
6:18 that's going to give me the height of my
6:20 range and the width of my range is only
6:23 one column so I'm just going to skip
6:25 that argument and close offset click
6:28 okay now we can check that the name has
6:31 been set up correctly by selecting it in
6:33 the name manager and then click in the
6:35 refers to the marching ants show me how
6:38 this offset formula is evaluating and
6:40 the range that it's going to return so
6:42 that's all good I'm going to copy it
6:44 create a new one and this is going to be
6:46 for my budget and I'm just going to
6:48 paste it in here and edit it so instead
6:52 of starting in cell D5 I'm going to
6:54 start in cell
6:56 H5 and I'm going to count column G and
7:00 I'm just going to press f2 that will
7:02 allow me to arrow through and replace C
7:06 with G there as well so click okay let's
7:09 check it's evaluating correctly it is so
7:12 we're all good so I'm going to create
7:14 the last Dynamic named range and that's
7:16 for the axis and again we'll use offset
7:20 now this one I want to pick up the year
7:22 label and the month so this range I want
7:25 to return will be two columns wide we're
7:27 going to skip the row argument and the
7:30 column argument I'm going to use count a
7:34 to count how many month labels I have
7:36 and I'm going to allow for growth down
7:38 to row 30 so that's going to give me the
7:40 height of my range and then I want it to
7:42 be two columns wide close parentheses
7:46 let's check that it evaluates correctly
7:48 it does so now all I need to do is
7:50 insert my chart so with nothing selected
7:53 just an empty cell I'm going to insert
7:55 an empty chart I'm going to right click
7:58 and we're going to select data and we'll
8:01 add a series the first one will be for
8:03 my chart actual now I'm going to use the
8:06 dynamic named Rangers that we set up but
8:09 they need to be prefixed by the sheet
8:10 name so I'm just going to select any
8:12 sale in the sheet and then I'm going to
8:14 delete the sell reference press F3 to
8:17 bring up the paste name box I'm going to
8:20 double click on the name I want to
8:22 insert so that's my actual let's add
8:25 another series for the budget doing the
8:27 same thing just click any old sell
8:30 notice that I'm keeping the exclamation
8:32 mark and this one's the
8:36 budget and then the chart axis remember
8:39 we need the sheet name first delete the
8:42 cell reference
8:44 F3 insert the chart access and click
8:47 okay you can see the chart behind is
8:50 taking shape so I'll click okay again
8:53 now I won't spend time formatting this
8:55 it's the same as the manual chart table
8:57 chart that I just built so I think you
8:59 can go ahead and figure that out on your
9:01 own keep in mind that the benefit with
9:04 this method is as these pivot tables
9:06 grow and more months are added to them
9:09 this chart's going to automatically pick
9:11 them up I don't need to worry about
9:12 editing any of the references to the
9:14 sales that the chart has cuz it's
9:16 reading those Dynamic named
9:19 ranges the final method which I call the
9:21 bait and switch is a bit less work than
9:24 the previous methods it works well with
9:26 charts that can ignore empty cells like
9:28 the Tre map and Sunburst Etc the first
9:32 step is to create a pivot table
9:34 containing the data for the chart and
9:36 insert a slicer if you require one then
9:39 I'm going to contrl a to select all of
9:41 the data in the pivot table contrl C to
9:44 copy it and I'm just going to paste it
9:46 here in some empty cells and I want to
9:48 paste it as Valu so alt ESV is keyboard
9:51 shortcut press enter there's my data now
9:55 all I need to do is insert the chart and
9:58 I'm going to use a tree map so now my
10:00 tree map is attached to this data behind
10:04 I want to point it back to the pivot
10:06 table so all I need to do is right click
10:09 and go in select data and edit the
10:11 references so that they reference the
10:14 pivot table so instead of column G for
10:17 actuals I want column C so we'll change
10:20 that reference there and this here and
10:23 here click okay and let's repeat for the
10:26 category labels so instead of columns e
10:28 and F I want columns A and B so let's
10:32 change that A to B click okay and okay
10:37 so the chart hasn't changed and you can
10:39 see that it's referencing the pivot
10:41 table so now I can get rid of these
10:43 cells here contrl minus to delete the
10:45 columns let's bring the slicer back
10:47 across and I'll just move the chart as
10:50 well now you can see as I select some
10:52 categories in the slicer it filters and
10:56 the chart updates and if we select the
10:58 chart you can see it's still referencing
11:00 all these empty cells so that when I
11:04 select all of the categories again the
11:06 chart updates but having those empty
11:08 cells isn't affecting the appearance of
11:11 the chart so like I said this technique
11:13 is great for charts that ignore empty
11:15 cells in their range so it's not going
11:17 to work for every
11:19 scenario you can download the Excel file
11:22 for this lesson from the link here I
