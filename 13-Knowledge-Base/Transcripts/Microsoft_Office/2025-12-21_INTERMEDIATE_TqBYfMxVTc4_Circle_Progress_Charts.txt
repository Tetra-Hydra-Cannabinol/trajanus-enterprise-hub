0:00 I'll let you in on a secret your charts
0:03 are boring that's why people aren't
0:05 reading your
0:08 reports this is so
0:13 boring well probably maybe in this video
0:19 I'll show you a couple of ways you can
0:20 create Dynamic Circle charts that
0:22 quickly convey progress in a powerful
0:24 and interesting way the downside is they
0:27 do take up a lot of space so I'll also
0:29 point to some Alternatives that aren't
0:31 space hogs for this example I'll be
0:34 using some ratings data for a bike
0:36 company and the data is stored in a
0:39 table and we can see it's called table
0:41 one now I'm going to insert a pivot
0:44 table onto an existing worksheet I'll
0:47 just pop it there and the pivot table
0:49 facilitates the interactivity through
0:51 slices now if you don't need your charts
0:53 to be interactive then you can skip this
0:55 step I want to summarize the ratings by
0:59 product and and I'm going to right click
1:01 and add the category as a slicer let's
1:04 just bring it up here for now the pivot
1:06 table instead of summing the ratings
1:08 let's average them so we're going to
1:09 summarize the values by
1:11 average and let's go ahead and format
1:14 the numbers as a percentage with no
1:16 decimal
1:17 places now I don't need the grand total
1:20 so I'll right click and remove that and
1:22 I'm only going to do charts for each
1:25 category at a time so if I filter by
1:27 category you can see each category only
1:30 has four items now I also need a column
1:33 for the balance to take me up to 100% so
1:37 let's go ahead and add that as a new
1:41 calculated
1:42 field we'll call the field rating Bal
1:46 and the formula is 1 minus the rating
1:50 double click to add it to the formula
1:52 click add to insert the field and okay
1:57 and there it is in my pivot table you
1:59 can leave leave it at sum of that's fine
2:02 we can actually Tidy Up The Heading
2:04 let's delete the sum of and notice I've
2:06 still got a space at the front that's
2:08 just going to differentiate the header
2:10 name from the field name it won't let
2:12 you duplicate the name of the field
2:15 let's also change this to rating
2:19 percent and we can just make these
2:21 columns a little narrower okay next I
2:24 need some values for the segments and
2:26 the segments in the chart can represent
2:28 Milestones they can Aid interpretation
2:31 or simply draw attention for this
2:34 example I want 30 equal size segments
2:37 and this requires another series we'll
2:40 call it segments and to generate the
2:42 series I'm going to use the sequence
2:44 function to return a list of 30 values
2:47 going to skip the columns argument and
2:49 start at zero minus a sequence of
2:53 another 30 rows starting at minus one
2:57 and this is just going to give me a list
2:59 of ones so rather than the sequence
3:01 function incrementing the values that
3:03 are returned just gives me 31s now if
3:06 you don't have the sequence function you
3:08 can simply select 30 cells type a one in
3:11 control and enter to enter one in each
3:14 cell now another option instead of the
3:17 same size segments is you can change the
3:19 values in each segment to vary their
3:22 sizes to reflect Milestones with the
3:24 total adding up to 100 so for example
3:27 the first segment might be 20% the next
3:30 30% and then 40 and 10 just keep in mind
3:34 that if you use this approach you'll
3:35 also need to add labels to each segment
3:38 to help people understand what those
3:40 segments represent I'm going to just
3:43 create 30 equal siiz segments so we'll
3:45 leave it at that and to start I'm going
3:49 to just select the segments and insert
3:52 under pie chart we've got
3:54 donut let's bring that over here closer
3:58 in fact while I'm here I'm just going to
3:59 to fix the slicer format so that it's
4:02 four columns wide that's just going to
4:04 make it horizontal we'll go into the
4:06 slicer settings and turn off the header
4:09 and let's just resize it to give them
4:12 more space all right now I can bring my
4:14 chart up here now I don't need the
4:17 legend so let's turn that off next I
4:20 want to format the segment color so on
4:22 the format tab I can choose the shape
4:24 fill or I can control one to open the
4:27 formatting Pane and that's what I prefer
4:29 to use so here for the segments I want a
4:33 solid
4:34 fill and I'm going to go with this
4:36 petrol color and then for the Border I
4:39 want a solid white border and that's
4:42 just going to allow each segment to
4:44 appear separate next I'm going to link
4:47 the chart title to the cell in my pivot
4:51 table for my first chart so with it
4:54 selected press enter let's just make
4:57 this chart a little narrower so so that
4:59 the chart area is in line with roughly
5:03 in line with the size of the
5:06 chart Okay so we've got our segments
5:09 next I need to add the rating values so
5:12 with the chart selected I'm going to
5:14 right click select data and add a series
5:19 the series name is in this cell and the
5:21 series values are these two we'll click
5:24 okay and okay and notice the two series
5:28 aren't sitting on top of each each other
5:29 which is what I actually want so I'm
5:31 going to select one of them and then on
5:33 the chart design tab we're going to
5:35 change the chart type and in here we're
5:37 going to put the helmet series on the
5:39 secondary axis and that's going to place
5:41 it on top of the segment Series so click
5:44 okay now I need to help that series
5:47 underneath shine through so I'm going to
5:49 select the top series and to just select
5:53 the 95% section of the segment I'm going
5:55 to select it again and then under the
5:58 fill I want no fill and then for the
6:01 balance select that separately I want
6:04 that to be a solid white fill but we're
6:07 going to make it transparent
6:10 25% so my chart's coming along let's do
6:13 some more formatting in order to copy
6:16 this I want to get rid of the border on
6:18 the chart shape so no fail for the shape
6:22 and no outline that's just going to
6:24 allow the charts to sort of overlap one
6:26 another and get them closer together
6:29 let's also format this in keeping with
6:31 my theme so on the Home tab I'm going to
6:33 change the font color to match my chart
6:36 let's give the font a different style
6:39 and we'll make it a bit bigger so now
6:41 that I've got my first chart complete I
6:43 can copy it three times for my other
6:46 products so close this pane holding down
6:48 control and shift I'm going to left
6:50 click and drag to copy it three times
6:54 and notice that they're quite close to
6:56 one another and they're actually
6:57 overlapping but because there's no
7:00 border and no background they're not
7:02 covering each other all right now all I
7:05 need to do is change each charts that's
7:08 picking up the next product in the pivot
7:11 table and notice that the formatting
7:13 gets lost but we'll fix that with a
7:15 clever trick in a moment all right so
7:17 there's my three charts let's copy the
7:20 formatting from this first one so
7:21 selecting the outer edge of the chart
7:23 crl C to copy select the next chart just
7:27 the outer edge paste SP special and then
7:31 formats let's repeat that for the other
7:34 ones paste special Now shortcut here is
7:38 just double click formats that selects
7:41 it and closes the dialogue box at the
7:44 same time all right now I need to link
7:48 my chart titles to my other
7:52 products and when you copy the
7:54 formatting it loses the formula that was
7:57 in the chart title origin orally so we
7:59 just have to add them back in and as a
8:02 Finishing Touch let's insert a text box
8:06 to display the percentage so with the
8:10 edge of the text box selected let's
8:12 equals and I can't select the cell in
8:16 the pivot table cuz you can see it puts
8:17 in the get pivot data formula and you
8:20 can't link a formula to a text box so
8:22 I'm going to click just outside and
8:24 change that to C4 and let's go ahead and
8:28 Center that we'll make it much bigger
8:31 let's change the font first in keeping
8:34 with my theme I'll make it the same
8:37 color and then let's change the format
8:40 so it's got no fill and no outline and
8:42 then let's left click and drag to copy
8:44 it across change that one to C5 it'll
8:47 lose the formatting but don't worry
8:48 we'll fix that in a moment with our
8:50 clever trick this one is
8:54 C6 and the last one is
8:58 C7 all right let's get the format here
9:02 so with it selected double click the
9:04 format painter and then just click on
9:06 each one and escape to release the
9:09 format let's make the slicer a bit
9:12 bigger in keeping with the width of the
9:14 charts and let's go ahead and give it a
9:17 color in keeping with my chart colors
9:20 and now I select different category in
9:23 the slicer we get a different set of
9:27 results now I'm just going to right
9:30 click and go into pivot table options
9:32 I'm going to turn off autofit so that
9:35 when I select an item in the slicer my
9:38 worksheet doesn't jump
9:40 around and there you have a pretty cool
9:43 effect interactive Circle progress
9:47 charts we can also create Circle
9:49 progress charts without segments using
9:51 the same data layout and of course we
9:53 don't need the segment series at all you
9:56 might like to make the donut size larger
9:58 so instead of instead of 75% 85 and
10:01 you'll also notice that for this series
10:03 that's the remaining balance instead of
10:06 formatting it in white I formatted it
10:08 with the same color but given it a 50%
10:11 transparency as cool as Circle progress
10:13 charts are they do take up a lot of
10:15 space and while you can make them
10:17 smaller sometimes you just can't make
10:19 them small enough in which case we have
10:22 some other options here with a simple
10:24 column chart we can create a thermometer
10:26 effect the average rating has The Fill
10:29 color and the balance has no fill giving
10:33 it that thermometer look and this is a
10:36 stacked column chart with these we can
10:38 make them much smaller so they can fit
10:40 into really tight
10:42 spaces or if you have qualitative bands
10:45 a bullet chart might be a better option
10:48 now there are links to tutorials for
10:50 both of these charts in the video
