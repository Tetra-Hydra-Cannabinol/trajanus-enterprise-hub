0:00 Excel dotplots dumbbells and lollipop
0:03 charts are good for comparing one two or
0:05 three points of data for example year on
0:08 year before after or a versus B and they
0:12 make a nice change from column or bar
0:14 charts and they're less cluttered also
0:17 because the dots aren't anchored to the
0:19 axis Baseline we're not required to
0:21 start the axis at zero like we do with
0:23 the column or bar chart unfortunately
0:26 dotplot dumbbell and lollipop charts
0:28 aren't available from the insert chart
0:30 menu so in this video I'll show you how
0:32 to build
0:33 them we'll take a look at dot plots
0:36 first here I've got my data and the
0:38 spacing simply assigns each department
0:40 to a row in your chart so they're nicely
0:42 vertically distributed you can change
0:45 the spacing to seeit your needs so I'm
0:47 going to select the data in columns B
0:49 and C and then we'll insert a scatter
0:52 plot I'll just bring it up into view the
0:55 first thing I want to do is rename this
0:58 series so I'm going to right click
1:00 select data we'll edit the spacing so
1:03 instead of it referencing the spacing
1:05 cell it's going to reference the year
1:07 label and click okay and okay now I want
1:11 to edit the vertical axis so that the
1:13 maximum is 2.5 so I'm just with it
1:16 selected control1 to open the formatting
1:19 so in here I want
1:21 2.5 and that just aligns my last dot
1:24 with the very top of the chart now I
1:26 want to hide the vertical axis so we'll
1:28 just go in here and deselect primary
1:32 vertical now if you want to emphasize
1:35 the difference between the dots we can
1:37 adjust the starting point for the
1:39 horizontal axis let me close that we'll
1:41 go into the axis options and in here
1:44 we'll set the minimum as 600 we get a
1:47 better feel for the difference from one
1:49 dot to the next now I'm going to remove
1:52 all of the grid lines and then we'll
1:55 format the dots so with the dots
1:58 selected going going to format the day
2:00 Series so I want to alter the fill and
2:02 line so we're going into the paint
2:04 bucket and then on the marker in options
2:07 I'm going to use the built-in marker but
2:09 I'm going to make it much bigger we'll
2:11 make it size 13 we'll give it a solid
2:13 fill it's automatically selected white
2:16 and that's the color I want the outline
2:19 or the Border will make it solid let's
2:22 change the color to this Bluey green
2:24 color and we'll make the width of the
2:26 line
2:28 thicker now I'll line need to do is add
2:30 some labels so go in here add labels I
2:34 want to go into more
2:36 options and in here I don't want the Y
2:39 value I want the x value we don't need
2:42 lead the lines but I'd also like to have
2:44 the department names so I'm going to use
2:46 value from sales this is new in Excel
2:48 2013 so if you've got 2013 or later
2:51 you'll have this option so I'm selecting
2:54 the department names we'll click okay we
2:57 just need to give our chart a little bit
3:00 more room for those
3:02 labels and there we have our DOT plot
3:06 chart now lollipop charts get their name
3:10 from The Leader line that draws your eye
3:11 to the dot and because of this I think
3:14 you should start your access at zero for
3:16 the same reasons we do with bar and
3:18 column charts and I'll talk more about
3:20 these reasons at the end they require
3:23 the same steps as the dock plot but
3:25 instead of using horizontal grid lines
3:27 we use error bars now to save time on
3:29 modify this Dot Plot chart that I've got
3:31 here and I'll just bring it over the top
3:33 of the lollipop so first of all I don't
3:36 need the horizontal grid lines so let's
3:38 remove those and then I'm going to add
3:41 the arrow bars I'm going to go Arrow
3:44 bars and then more options now by
3:46 default it's going to put in a vertical
3:48 Arrow bar I want to change the
3:51 horizontal Arrow bar so I want this one
3:53 with the
3:54 X and now I have the horizontal araar
3:57 settings I can choose minus no cap and
4:01 down here for percentage I want that to
4:03 be 100 and now you can see the lollipop
4:06 stalk I can select these vertical error
4:09 bars and press the delete key CU we
4:11 don't need those anymore another thing I
4:14 might do is move these labels and put
4:16 them to the right of the
4:20 dots and now we have our lollipop chart
4:23 so I can change the name up
4:26 here remember to make sure that your
4:28 lollipop chart starts at
4:31 zero now dumbbell charts which are
4:34 sometimes called DNA charts require the
4:36 same steps as a dotplot except they have
4:38 a second series for the other year we
4:41 also need to calculate the difference
4:43 between the years and place those values
4:45 in their respective columns and these
4:48 become the positive error values and the
4:50 negative error values you can see the
4:52 formula in the formula bar you can
4:54 download the file to get a closer look
4:57 I'm not going to go into detail on that
4:58 formula here
5:00 so let's go about creating our charts
5:02 like I said they're the same as the
5:04 dotplot so we'll start off by inserting
5:06 a scatter chart and I'll just move it
5:09 down here so we can see our data behind
5:12 now I need to add a series for 2016 so
5:15 right click select data add the series
5:19 name will be 2016 the values are the
5:22 values for 2016 and the Y series values
5:26 are our spacing values so click okay now
5:30 while I'm in here I'm just going to edit
5:32 the name in here so instead of
5:34 referencing this cell we'll select the
5:36 label for the X values so click okay and
5:40 okay again and now you can see we've got
5:43 our two Series in the chart let's
5:45 continue to tidy it up a little get rid
5:48 of the grid lines we're going to use
5:50 errow bars let's set this vertical axis
5:53 control one to open the access options
5:56 we want to make the maximum 2 and 1/2
6:00 off and now we can hide that so let's go
6:02 in here and we'll turn off the primary
6:05 vertical axis now I just need to format
6:08 the dots like I did before so we go into
6:11 the Paint Bucket
6:13 marker marker options builtin size 13
6:18 obviously you can change the size to
6:19 something else if it suits you better I
6:22 want solid fill in white and I'll have a
6:25 solid border and let's make it thicker
6:29 and then I just need to rinse and repeat
6:32 for the next marker so again builtin
6:35 13 solid
6:37 fill in white and then solid line this
6:41 one I'll change it to Green so that it's
6:44 different and let's make it
6:47 thicker so there's our dots now unlike
6:51 the column and bar charts and the
6:52 lollipop charts I don't need to start my
6:54 horizontal axis at zero so let's change
6:57 the minimum to 600 100 that just gives a
7:01 bit more space between our dots I'm also
7:03 going to bring this chart area down here
7:05 a little so there's bit more room for
7:07 the dots so I'm ready to add my error
7:10 bars and remember I'm going to be
7:11 referencing these helper columns here so
7:14 I'm going to select the 2016 series and
7:17 then we'll add error bars but we'll go
7:20 into more options it defaults to the
7:23 vertical Arrow bar so let me choose the
7:26 X Arrow bar and in here I can change the
7:30 settings so I want both again I want no
7:34 cap this time I'm going to have a custom
7:37 value so I'm going to click on specify
7:39 value and this is where I select my
7:41 positive error and my negative errors
7:46 and click okay now we've got the
7:48 horizontal error bars let me select the
7:50 vertical ones I'll press delete to get
7:52 rid of them and that gives us the
7:55 dumbbell
7:56 appearance let's add some labels so
7:58 we'll go in add data labels we need to
8:01 obviously go into more options so we can
8:04 modify them a bit here I want the x
8:07 value not the Y values and I don't need
8:10 lead lines let's put these ones to the
8:13 right and let's also add a value from
8:17 the cells so that we can have the
8:18 department names
8:20 included now we just need to give it a
8:22 bit more
8:24 space now I just need to modify these
8:27 labels for the 2016 Series so again we
8:30 want the x value not the Y value we
8:33 don't need lead lines and these ones are
8:35 Al line left now all looks great except
8:38 for Department D where the 2016 value is
8:42 greater than the 2017 value so we're
8:44 going to need to manually modify just
8:47 these labels so I'm going to click on
8:48 them once and then click on it again to
8:51 select just Department D's this one I'll
8:54 set to the
8:55 right and this one I'm going to set to
8:58 the left
9:00 and then you have the dumbbell chart now
9:03 with all of these cool charts you might
9:05 be wondering which one to use and your
9:07 choice will depend on the point that you
9:09 want to
9:10 emphasize keep in mind that dotplots
9:13 lollipops and dumbbell charts are an
9:15 alternative to bar and column charts
9:17 which enable you to quickly compare the
9:19 size of one Department to the next and
9:21 compare one period to the next for each
9:24 department but you must always start a
9:26 bar or column chart access at zero other
9:29 wise you can mislead the difference from
9:31 one bar to the next for example if we
9:33 look at these two bar charts they plot
9:35 exactly the same data but the second
9:37 chart's access starts at 600 million and
9:40 looking at Department a it appears that
9:42 their sales in 2017 are double that of
9:45 2016 and it's because we subconsciously
9:48 compare the lengths of the bars dot
9:51 plots on the other hand allow
9:53 comparisons between departments with
9:55 more emphasis on the difference because
9:57 we don't have to start the axis as zero
9:59 and because they're not anchored to the
10:01 axis we rely on the labels and their
10:04 position on the axis to make comparisons
10:06 so there's less chance of misleading the
10:09 reader now lollipops are a slightly less
10:11 clutter take on a bar chart but because
10:14 they're anchored to the access you
10:15 should ensure it starts zero and lastly
10:19 dumbbell charts emphasize the change
10:21 from one point to the next with some
10:23 comparison between departments and the
10:26 axis here can also start above zero
10:28 because they aren't anchored you can

10:34 use of these charts if you like this
