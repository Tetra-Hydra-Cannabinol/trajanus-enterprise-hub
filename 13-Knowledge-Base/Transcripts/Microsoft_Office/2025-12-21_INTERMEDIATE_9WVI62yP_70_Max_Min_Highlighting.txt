0:00 highlighting the minimum and maximum in
0:02 a line chart can help Focus your reader
0:04 attention now we can manually select
0:07 points or columns and change the color
0:09 and that's fine for static charts but if
0:11 your chart gets updated then you'll want
0:13 to automate the process let me show you
0:16 how in my data table I have two extra
0:19 columns one for the maximum value and
0:21 one for the minimum and you can see in
0:24 the formula bar that the max column is
0:26 checking whether the value in the sales
0:28 column is the maximum and if it's not it
0:31 returns a zero likewise for the minimum
0:35 formula okay let's insert a column
0:43 chart and I'll make it a little
0:47 bigger we can see here that we've got
0:49 the three series The Sals the dark green
0:53 the maximum and the minimum and
0:55 obviously there's only one bar for the
0:56 maximum and the minimum now we want to
0:59 overlap lap these columns so that the
1:01 Max and Min columns sit on top of the
1:03 sales ones so I'm going to control one
1:06 to open the format data series Pane and
1:08 in series overlap I want 100% and let's
1:12 make the Gap width 50 so that the
1:14 columns are a bit wider the next thing I
1:16 want to do is color my columns let's
1:19 make the sales values a little paler so
1:22 we'll go with a gray
1:24 color this one here and that will help
1:27 our Max and minimum columns to stand out
1:30 we can also format them now I've got a
1:32 bit of a bug in my excel at the moment
1:34 so I'm going to choose the max series
1:37 from this drop down here and you can see
1:39 it's selected in the table but it
1:41 doesn't appear to be selected in the
1:42 chart but if you watch like magic it
1:46 will change color so we're going to
1:47 format it in this teal color and let's
1:50 do the same for the minimum Series so
1:53 I'll select it and this one you can see
1:55 it's selected in the chart and you can
1:57 also see the series selected here let's
2:00 make this one this orange color okay
2:04 let's also add some labels just to these
2:06 Minimax Series so want data labels
2:09 outside the end we'll do the same for
2:13 the
2:14 Max and outside the end now notice that
2:20 all of the other bars that don't have a
2:22 value that are zero values also have
2:24 these zero labels and they're looking a
2:26 bit ugly so one way to hide them is to
2:29 format the numbers in our source data
2:32 with a custom number format that hides
2:34 the zero so I'm going to control one to
2:36 open the format cells dialogue box and
2:39 then I want a custom format and here I
2:42 want a single digit for the positive the
2:44 negative will be a single digit and then
2:48 for my zero value I'm not going to add a
2:51 format I'm going to leave it blank and
2:53 that will effectively hide the zeros
2:55 click okay now they're gone from my
2:57 table and they're also gone from my ch
2:59 chart
3:00 labels let's format these chart labels
3:03 so that they're in keeping with the
3:05 columns so this one's orange and I'm
3:07 just going to make it bold so it's
3:09 easier to read and this one will make
3:12 the teal color and also bold so all
3:16 we're left to do is tidy up the chart a
3:18 I'll delete the grid lines let's pop the
3:21 legend at the top and I'll just bring it
3:25 up here onto the right hand side and
3:27 we'll move the label the chart title
3:29 across to the
3:31 left and that will give us a little bit
3:33 more room for our chart
3:36 information so that's the column chart
3:39 now if my data were to change for
3:40 example if this value was now 100 you'll
3:44 see the chart will automatically update
3:47 and my highlighting for the max value
3:48 has moved likewise let's make this one
3:51 45 and my highlighting automatically
3:54 update and if you were to add more data
3:57 the chart will automatically pick it up
3:59 and these formulas will be copied down
4:01 because my data is formatted in an Excel
4:04 table so once you set everything up it's
4:06 low
4:08 maintenance okay let's take a look at
4:10 the line chart
4:12 option again in my table I have two
4:15 extra columns one for the maximum and
4:17 one for the minimum however this time if
4:20 the value on the current row isn't the
4:21 maximum or the minimum depending on the
4:23 column it will return the hash and a
4:25 error and we return hash and a errors
4:28 because these don't get plotted in line
4:30 charts whereas a zero value like I used
4:32 in the column chart previously that
4:35 would result in the line dipping down to
4:37 the horizontal axis and we don't want
4:38 that so let's go ahead and insert the
4:44 chart and for this I want the line chart
4:47 with
4:48 markers and again I'll just make it a
4:50 bit
4:51 bigger so we can see there's a small dot
4:54 that's hard to distinguish for the max
4:56 value and one for the minimum let's go
4:59 go ahead and format these lines so I'm
5:02 going to use the format tab here change
5:05 the shape fill and shape outline for the
5:07 sales values then I'm going to select my
5:11 maximum value again it's not showing up
5:13 as selected here in the chart but we can
5:15 see it's selected in the table so I'm
5:18 going to control one to open the format
5:20 Pane and on the Paint Bucket here for
5:23 this series I don't want to show a line
5:24 at all I want to show the marker and
5:28 let's choose one of the buil markers the
5:30 dot is fine we'll make it bigger so I
5:32 want it size
5:33 11 and then I don't want any fill but I
5:37 want my border to be a solid line and
5:40 this is the maximum value so going to go
5:41 with this teal color and I'm just going
5:44 to make the line a bit thicker so it's
5:45 easier to
5:46 see so that's my maximum we need to
5:50 rinse and repeat for the minimum so
5:52 let's go ahead and select that Series so
5:55 here I
5:56 want for my line no line the marker will
6:00 be the built-in marker at size 11 we
6:04 want no fill and a solid Border in the
6:07 orange color and we'll thicken the line
6:10 up so it's easier to see and again let's
6:12 add some data labels for these markers
6:15 so this one I want it to be below
6:17 because it's always going to be the
6:19 minimum I want the label to be sit at
6:21 the bottom and let's go ahead and do the
6:24 same for the maximum value and this time
6:28 we want the label to be
6:30 above and let's also apply the
6:33 formatting go with the tail color and
6:35 bold and this one needs to be
6:39 orange and
6:41 bold so what we need to do now is tidy
6:43 up the chart like we did before We'll
6:45 add the legend back to the top and I'll
6:49 just left click and drag it to the right
6:50 hand side and we'll move the chart title
6:53 across to the
6:56 left this will give us more room for our
6:58 chart
7:00 and just like with the column chart if I
7:02 change one of these values it
7:04 automatically updates in the chart so I
7:06 don't have to do any further maintenance
7:09 once my chart is set up and linked to
7:11 the table you can download the file for
7:14 this lesson from the link here a big
