0:00 What if I told you there are Excel tools
you're probably not using that could
0:04 instantly improve your workflow? Hidden
within Excel, sometimes in plain sight,
0:09 are game-changing tools that most users
overlook. Today, I'm going to show you how
0:13 to master them to transform your productivity.
Now, my favorite is number three. Don't forget
0:18 to let me know in the comments which one
you like the most and how you plan to use
0:22 it. I've also included the example file, and
you'll find the link in the video description.
0:28 If you work with large spreadsheets that are
particularly wide, you might have a habit of
0:32 hiding columns so that you have more space
to work with. But then, if you need them,
0:37 you have to unhide them and then hide them again,
and it can become tiresome. A quicker way is to
0:43 simply select the columns or rows that you want
to hide, and then on the Data tab of the ribbon,
0:49 click Group. And now, I've got this group button;
I can quickly hide and unhide the columns as I
0:55 need. You can have multiple groups, you can even
have multiple layers of groups. So, for example,
1:00 I can group these columns as well, and now I can
just hide them or I can hide all of them. We also
1:08 have these buttons on the left here that quickly
collapse all and expand all buttons, and you
1:13 can have up to eight groups. Now, if you need to
ungroup any columns or rows, simply select them,
1:19 click Ungroup, and again until they're all gone.
Now, for homework, you can try grouping the rows.
1:27 Most people use Paste Special
to paste formulas as values,
1:30 but there are a load of other super useful tools
hiding in plain sight in the Paste Special dialog
1:35 box that you could be missing out on. Here I
have a series of negative values that I want
1:40 to convert into positive values. I can do
it easily enough by adding a formula that
1:46 multiplies the value by minus one, and then I
copy it down and then copy that across and paste
1:53 it as values. But that is a load of work, so the
quicker way to do it is to type in an empty cell,
2:00 minus one, copy that cell, select the values,
paste special, multiply, job done. What if you
2:11 want to convert these values to percentages?
Well, we can apply the percentage formatting,
2:16 but that's usually not what you'd expect, so let's
undo that. An easy way is to type 1% into a cell,
2:23 copy that, select the cells, paste special,
multiply, click OK, and now they're percentages.
2:33 Here I have a series of values that I
want to copy across to column H. Now,
2:37 I could copy them one by one, skipping the cells
that don't have values, but the quicker way is
2:44 to select them all, Ctrl+C to copy, select the
range you want to paste them to, paste special,
2:52 and then skip blanks, click OK. Now, I can
clearly see column H is updated without
2:59 affecting the cells containing blanks that
were also copied. So, there you have three
3:04 useful Paste Special tools, but take some
time to try out the others for homework.
3:08 The copying and pasting tips don't end there.
Normally, we copy and paste, then if we perform
3:13 another action, the clipboard is cleared. But
there's a little-known way we can store multiple
3:18 items on the clipboard for pasting whenever we
need. On the Home tab of the ribbon, we have the
3:23 Clipboard group of tools with copy, paste, etc.,
and in the bottom right of this group, we've got
3:28 an icon that opens the Clipboard. This opens the
Clipboard in a task pane on the left, and when the
3:34 Clipboard is open, it keeps a list of up to the
last 24 items that you've copied or cut. These
3:41 can be from any app across Windows and include
text, values, images, etc. It's super handy if
3:49 you want to repeatedly paste multiple items. So,
for example, here I might want to put some emojis
3:55 beside values that I'm happy with and others
that I'm unhappy with, and I can do that quickly
4:01 and easily without having to constantly copy and
paste or insert emojis from somewhere else. Now,
4:08 you can keep the Clipboard tidy by clicking on the
drop-down here and deleting any items that you're
4:13 not going to need to use again. Alternatively, you
can click Clear All and start from scratch. In the
4:19 bottom left, we have Options, and here there are
various settings for how you want to work with
4:24 the Clipboard, including an option to have it
open automatically when you press Ctrl+C twice.
4:31 You'll find this same Clipboard in all Office
apps, but there's also a Windows Clipboard that's
4:36 independent. You open it by pressing the Windows
key and V. This opens a separate task pane that
4:42 floats above the canvas, and to insert an item,
simply click on it once and in it goes. However,
4:49 once you select an item or you click away from
the Windows Clipboard, it closes. You've got to
4:54 press Windows+V again to open it, which can be a
bit of a pain. However, one of the nice features
4:59 we have with this Clipboard is we can pin an item.
Now, this doesn't pin it to the top of the list,
5:05 but it does retain it in the event that you
clear the Clipboard by pressing Clear All.
5:09 While we're here, notice we also have symbols,
and they're grouped into most frequently used,
5:16 general punctuation, currency symbols, and
more. We also have kaomojis, GIFs, emojis,
5:23 and most recently used. Shout out to fellow
MVP Wyn Hopkins for the Windows+V shortcut that
5:29 opens this task pane. Now, if you like
the floating feature of the task pane,
5:34 you can always left-click and drag the Clipboard
out, and now it's a floating task pane. The
5:40 thing I like about this Clipboard is it doesn't
disappear if you select a cell in the worksheet.
5:47 We often need to hide sheets in our workbooks
to keep them tidy by hiding workings and prevent
5:52 users from accidentally breaking our formulas or
to keep information confidential. But there's a
5:58 problem with the way most users hide sheets.
Let me show you. When you right-click and hide
6:03 a sheet, it's no longer available to navigate to,
which is great. However, if you right-click any of
6:09 the other sheet tabs, you'll notice Unhide is now
available, and this is like a red rag to a bull as
6:15 some users will be intrigued to know what you're
keeping from them, and they can simply click on it
6:20 and unhide the sheet. Now, you can protect the
workbook structure. For example, if I hide the
6:26 sheet and then on the Review tab, I can protect
the workbook. I can even add a password and click
6:32 OK, and then if I right-click any sheet tabs,
both Hide and Unhide are unavailable. But there's
6:39 another way I prefer to do it, which doesn't alert
the user to the fact that there's anything hidden.
6:45 So, let's unhide that and we'll try again. For
this, you'll need the Developer tab. If you don't
6:50 see it, right-click, go into Customize the Ribbon,
and then make sure Developer is selected here
6:57 and click OK. What we want to do is go into the
Visual Basic editor. Alternatively, you can press
7:03 the keyboard shortcut Alt+F11. This opens the
Visual Basic for Applications task pane. In here,
7:09 you want to locate the sheet here that you want
to hide, and then in the Properties pane below,
7:15 and if you don't see it, go to the View tab and
choose Properties Window. Then, at the bottom,
7:21 we're going to change the visibility
property from Visible to Very Hidden,
7:27 and if you keep an eye on the sheet down below,
you'll see it disappears. Now, if we go back to
7:33 Excel and right-click, you can see Unhide is
still grayed out, so the users are none the
7:39 wiser that anything is hidden. Now, to bring the
sheet back, go back into the Visual Basic editor,
7:44 select the sheet from the list, click on the
drop-down, and change it back to Sheet Visible,
7:50 and now it's back. Of course, none of this
is entirely secure because Excel sheet and
7:55 workbook protection can be removed, so don't
rely on this for super confidential data.
8:00 When working with data, it can be time-consuming
to interpret key information in a sea of numbers,
8:06 and we risk missing key insights. Thankfully,
Excel has some clever ways we can make our lives
8:12 easier. Here I've calculated the year-on-year
percentage change, and while it clearly shows
8:17 which are positive variances and negative, this
may not be intuitive for someone who doesn't work
8:22 in finance. Another way we can visually indicate
the direction of the change is with symbols. We'll
8:28 start by selecting an empty cell, and then on the
Insert tab of the ribbon, click Symbol. Here, make
8:34 sure Geometric Shapes is selected in the subset,
and then I'm just going to double-click on the up
8:40 triangle and the down triangle to insert them. You
can see them in the cell behind. Click Close. Now,
8:46 I'm just going to select them and Ctrl+C to copy
them to my Clipboard. I'm going to escape out of
8:52 there. What I'm going to do is apply a custom
number format to these cells. So, Ctrl+1 to
8:57 open the formatting pane, and then Custom. Up
here, it's already got Percentage applied, so
9:04 I'm just going to modify this format. I'm going to
add a space, Ctrl+V to paste in my symbols. Now,
9:11 this is my positive percentage, and then I'm going
to add a semicolon, and that's going to separate
9:19 it from my negative format, which is going to
be a percentage with a downward triangle. You
9:24 can see we get a preview for the first cell, and
then click OK. Just like that, I now have visual
9:31 indicators that clearly show whether the change
is upward or downward. Custom number formats are
9:37 a vast topic with so many cool things you can do,
and I've put together a comprehensive guide and
9:43 cheat sheet that you can download from the link
in the video description, so be sure to grab that.
9:48 Another tool we can use to make it quick
to interpret our data and identify patterns
9:52 is conditional formatting, and there are loads
of built-in options for quick results. Taking the
9:57 previous example, we can make it even quicker
to interpret by color-coding the variances.
10:02 I'll start by selecting the cells, then on the
Home tab of the ribbon, Conditional Formatting,
10:08 Highlight Cells Rules, Greater Than. For the
cells greater than zero, I'm going to format
10:15 with a customized format, which is with a
font color of this dark green. Click OK,
10:23 and OK. Let's repeat for the negative variances.
So, cells that are less than zero. Click on the
10:33 drop-down, Customize Format, and in here, I'm
going to go with purple. You could go with the
10:39 traditional red and green for good and bad, but
this purple color is more easily accessible for
10:45 those with color vision deficiencies. Click OK,
and OK. Now, of course, you could set up a third
10:51 format for zero values if you want. If I click
away, you can see with the color coding, it's
10:58 even faster to interpret and easily pick out the
negative results that might need our attention.
11:03 Another way we could visually indicate the
variances is with conditional formatting icons.
11:08 I'll select the cells, and then again on the
Home tab of the ribbon, Conditional Formatting,
11:12 Icon Set. We've got this up and down triangle
here. I'll select that one, and then I'm just
11:18 going to go back in and manage the rules. Click
on this one, Edit Rule. It's currently applying
11:25 the formatting based on a percentile, so we've got
38% that's a positive change set to neutral. We
11:32 need to change that. We do that by choosing Number
here. So, when the value is greater than or equal
11:38 to zero, it's going to get a green triangle. Then
we want to change this also to Number. When it's
11:43 less than zero and greater than or equal to zero,
it's going to get the yellow dash. When it's less
11:48 than zero, it's going to get the triangle. Click
OK, and OK. There we go. Now, unfortunately,
11:56 you can't change the color of these triangles,
so if you need to make your files accessible,
12:01 then the previous example with the symbols is
better. Another thing I like about using the
12:06 symbols in the custom number formats is you can
also use these in chart labels, as you can see
12:12 here. Whereas there's no conditional formatting
for charts themselves. Conditional formatting
12:17 is another tool that has myriad built-in options,
but the real power comes when you know how to use
12:22 formulas to apply formats. So, in this video,
I take you under the hood to reveal how Excel
12:28 uses formulas in conditional formatting,
so check that out next. I'll see you there.
