0:03 in this video we're going to look at
0:05 creating the slope graphs using Excel a
0:08 slope graphs were first introduced by
0:10 Edward tufty in his book the visual
0:13 display of quantitative information back
0:15 in 1983 where he referred to them as
0:18 table Graphics the more catchy term
0:21 slope graphs came much later and slope
0:24 graphs are useful for comparing change
0:26 over time for example the slope graph
0:28 here shows the change in long-term
0:30 health conditions from 2001 through to
0:34 2014 2015 for Australia now I've messed
0:37 with the data a little for this example
0:39 so don't go making any business
0:41 decisions based on this chart
0:44 unfortunately slope graphs are very
0:46 similar to a line chart that has just
0:48 two points for each line now
0:50 unfortunately the labeling of these two
0:53 points which is one of the main
0:54 attributes of a slope slope graph is not
0:57 so easy I've found some ways to Wrangle
1:01 Excel to create slope graphs and a
1:03 shortcut if you're happy with something
1:05 that's almost a slope graph so let's get
1:08 started I've got a blank sheet here just
1:11 with my data so the first thing we do is
1:14 select the data down to the bottom of
1:18 the main Series this series of numbers
1:22 here in column C and rows 16 through
1:25 25 is just for our second set of value
1:29 labels
1:30 and we'll pick those up in a moment but
1:33 in order to get the chart laid out
1:34 correctly when we insert it we want to
1:37 select just that part of the data and
1:39 then insert and a regular 2D line
1:42 chart so here we we need to right click
1:45 on the chart and select data we need to
1:48 switch the row and column so if I show
1:50 you what happens when we switch row and
1:53 column now I have my lines are a bit
1:57 squished I'll click okay and we'll
1:59 delete the Legend now we have a bit more
2:01 room let's just make it a bit
2:04 bigger I want to delete these grid lines
2:07 so just left click on them press delete
2:10 likewise with the vertical axis click on
2:13 it and press delete and now the fun
2:15 begins the labeling so I'm recording
2:17 this in Xcel 2013 and if you're using
2:20 Xcel 2016 then this will be the same but
2:23 if you're using Excel 2007 or 2010 then
2:27 you'll need to click on your chart and
2:28 then up in the chart tools you'll have a
2:30 tab for layout I think it is so up there
2:33 you'll find the chart elements I'm going
2:37 to click on the plus here and I'm going
2:39 to add data labels I'm going to click on
2:42 the arrow and go more options so if
2:45 you're using 2017 or 2010 you want to go
2:47 to more options and that will open the
2:50 dialogue box which will have similar
2:52 settings to what you see here so now
2:54 that I've added my labels you see the
2:56 default is the value label on each end
2:59 of of the line or at each point it just
3:01 happens to be the end cuz I only have
3:03 two points for each line and the very
3:07 top labels are selected so the changes I
3:10 make now in these options over here will
3:14 only be applied to the first two points
3:17 and this is the annoying part because
3:18 you actually have to repeat this for
3:20 every point and you have to do it
3:22 manually so what we want to do is add
3:24 the series name deselect the leader
3:27 lines change the separator to a space as
3:30 opposed to a comma and the reason we
3:32 want to do this is you see with the
3:34 separator as a comma the value wraps
3:37 onto the next line when you use a space
3:40 you're able to actually make that label
3:43 stretch across just one line so there's
3:45 no wrapping I have to resize the boxes
3:48 to do that but we'll come to that in a
3:50 moment for now I just want to add the
3:52 series name remove the leader lines
3:55 change the separator to a space and left
3:58 align label
4:00 so you'll see they're both left aligned
4:02 and this one here is the one we actually
4:04 want left aligned and this one here we
4:07 want right aligned what I'm going to do
4:10 though is I'm going to work through all
4:12 the uh labels on the left and then we'll
4:15 come to the labels on the right so back
4:18 to my label
4:20 options and in here I'm going to use my
4:23 arrow keys so at the moment my top
4:27 labels are selected if I use the up
4:29 Arrow it moves me down to the next set
4:32 and I can just apply the same settings
4:36 we'll select the next
4:38 one now you need to repeat this for each
4:41 one so I'm going to pause the video and
4:44 quickly go through and make all these
4:46 changes so that you don't have to watch
4:48 me do it one by one cuz it get quite
4:51 boring okay so I've modified all of my
4:54 labels so they now show the series name
4:56 and the value I'm just going to make my
4:59 chart a bit
5:00 wider and a little
5:03 taller so now the fun begins because we
5:06 need to resize some of these labels that
5:10 are wrapping and any that overlap so
5:12 when I left click on the labels both are
5:15 selected if I left click once more and
5:18 it's not a double click it's just two
5:19 slow left clicks I then have pull
5:22 handles and this is in 2013 and 2016 if
5:26 you're using Excel 20110 then you don't
5:30 have these pull handles that are
5:32 available on the second left click what
5:34 you have to do is make your chart really
5:36 really wide and then select the plot
5:39 area and make that a bit smaller so that
5:42 your lines oops so that your lines
5:46 aren't really really wide okay so you
5:48 just need to mess about with it until
5:51 you get it how you want I'm going to
5:52 undo that cuz that's for 2010 and in
5:55 2013 I have the luxury of the two left
5:58 clicks and then the pool handles allow
5:59 me to make them wider so basically you
6:03 need to spend a bit of time resizing all
6:06 of these boxes and the chart until you
6:09 get it laid out the way you want so I'll
6:13 skip on to the ones that are over
6:15 lapping each other and two left clicks
6:20 and then I can hold down my shift key
6:22 and I can move it and it will stay
6:25 aligned to the right or left more easily
6:29 so that's the back problems and that's
6:31 21 and shortsightedness is 20.8 so I
6:34 want back problems above
6:38 shortsightedness and then we'll use the
6:41 arrow keys to select the other one there
6:44 we go so just move them so they're not
6:47 sitting on top of each other don't worry
6:49 about the right hand side at this point
6:52 you might need to move some of these so
6:54 that they're closer to the line and it's
6:58 a big fiddly problem you want to get
7:01 some supplies because you'll get hungry
7:04 it will take you ages so this is really
7:05 a labor of love this chart it's not
7:08 something you want to just quickly whip
7:09 up okay so you'll go through and do all
7:12 of those changes to the left and make
7:15 them all aligned nicely and then you'll
7:18 want to go and modify the right and this
7:20 is where the second series of values
7:23 comes in So at the moment the Val the
7:26 labels on the left are a single label
7:29 that contains the series name and the
7:30 series value and so are the ones on the
7:33 right the problem is we want the order
7:36 of the labels on the right to show
7:38 number or value and then series name if
7:40 we look at the other one you can see
7:43 it's the value and then the series name
7:45 and what you'll see is these are
7:47 actually two separate labels one on the
7:51 right is the series name and then we
7:53 have a separate one for the value and
7:56 these values come from this set of
7:59 numbers here and that's all because we
8:01 can't change the order these are
8:02 displayed in so what we need to do is
8:05 expand our Series so I've clicked in the
8:07 plot area of the chart and I'm going to
8:11 drag the blue marker down and now I have
8:16 two sets of labels on the right you can
8:17 see I've got the value labels now and
8:19 those ones I've just added plus I've got
8:22 this label that contains the series and
8:24 the value so I'm going to left click on
8:27 the series on the right or the label on
8:29 the right right and I'm going to modify
8:31 that to remove the value and then I'm
8:35 going to right align it you'll see it's
8:37 overlapped the value and I just need to
8:41 hold down the shift key and drag it
8:43 across to the
8:44 right so that it's not sitting on top of
8:48 the number and then you simply rinse and
8:51 repeat
8:53 oops remove the value and align right
8:58 and then hold down shift left click and
9:01 drag it
9:02 across so you do this for each
9:06 one and if you've got lots and lots of
9:09 lines it could take you a while
9:11 basically that's how you get the
9:13 labeling in a slope graph to lay out the
9:17 correct way in Excel it's a bit of a
9:19 hack of a line chart with a dummy series
9:22 of labels or values for the right hand
9:26 value
9:27 labels so the next thing you want to do
9:29 is make sure that your chart colors are
9:32 not making it look like a pile of Pickup
9:35 Sticks so perhaps pick something more
9:37 neutral maybe Shades of Gray or blue and
9:41 if you want to you can highlight one or
9:43 two points although the degree of the
9:46 line should draw the reader's eye to
9:49 those particular points but you can add
9:53 some emphasis just don't go crazy with
9:56 the
9:57 colors now if you'd prefer something
10:00 that is a bit less labor intensive then
10:03 you could leave your points so or your
10:07 labels on the right so that they
10:09 are displaying as the series name and
10:13 then the value like this one here and
10:16 then you don't need this extra set of
10:20 data you can just simply select the
10:23 right hand label and set it to the right
10:27 although I think it's not as effective
10:29 as having the value at the very ends of
10:32 the lines and it is a bit of a a shift
10:35 from tuft's original design for the
10:37 slope graph but if you'll press for time
10:39 then that might be a suitable option for
10:42 you you'll also want to make the length
10:45 of the line a bit shorter than what I
10:46 have here so bear that in mind try and
10:49 get the length of the line right before
10:51 you mess about with all your formatting
10:53 of your labels because reducing the
10:55 width of your chart will have an effect
10:58 on where those labels are positioned and
11:02 now that I've reduced my plot area it
11:04 looks like my chart is not aligned to my
11:07 chart area or my actual lines are not
11:11 centered so a simple way to avoid that
11:14 appearance is just to remove the outline
11:16 from the chart Al together and you can
11:18 move the chart title over to the left or
11:21 manually Center it if we remove the grid
11:25 lines from the page now you can't tell
11:28 that the chart isn't aligned in the
11:30 chart
11:31 area Okay so there's a way to create
11:35 slope gross in Excel it's quite
11:38 laborious but they are very effective
11:40 for showing the degree of change in data
11:43 over time so they're worth the effort in
11:45 certain situations
