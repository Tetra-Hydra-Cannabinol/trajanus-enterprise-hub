0:00 in this video I'm going to teach you
0:02 some different ways to visualize
0:03 year-on-year data and you'll see that
0:05 the message conveyed depends on the
0:07 chart you choose line charts are greater
0:10 at displaying data over time and we can
0:13 start the vertical axis above zero to
0:15 accentuate changes in the data for
0:18 example in this chart we can see at a
0:20 glance that the trend is upward whereas
0:22 this chart shows the same data with a
0:25 separate data series for each year which
0:27 more clearly illustrates seasonality in
0:29 the data the key to generating a chart
0:32 like this is to format your data with
0:34 the years in the columns and the months
0:36 in the rows let's take a
0:38 look the most common line chart simply
0:41 shows the data over a continuous
0:43 timeline and this illustrates the trend
0:45 really well notice the chart Source data
0:48 has the years and months in the row
0:50 labels of the pivot table and this
0:52 results in a continuous date access with
0:55 nested year and month
0:58 labels whereas this line chart has a
1:01 separate series for each year allowing
1:03 you to more easily see seasonality in
1:05 the data and we achiev this by putting
1:08 the years in separate columns and the
1:10 months in the row labels if you're able
1:12 to it's a good idea to align the legend
1:15 to the lines in the chart this just
1:17 makes it quicker and easier for your
1:20 audience column charts are another
1:22 common way to display year on-year data
1:25 however notice that even with a change
1:27 in the color scheme for the columns it's
1:29 not as easy to see the trend in the data
1:32 or compare one year to the other and for
1:34 that reason this is my least favorite
1:36 year-on-year data chart I should also
1:39 point out that unlike line charts with
1:42 column charts it's really important that
1:44 the vertical axis always starts at zero
1:47 this is because we subconsciously
1:48 compare the height of the columns to one
1:51 another so starting the axis above zero
1:54 can exaggerate the variances between the
1:56 columns and mislead our
1:58 audience another option is to show the
2:01 variance year on year but this only
2:04 works well for 2 years worth of data we
2:06 can enhance charts like this with some
2:08 simple formatting for example if I
2:11 select one of the bars control one to
2:14 open the formatting let me close that
2:16 pan and I'll bring this over closer to
2:18 the Chart here if I put one of the
2:20 series on the secondary axis I can set
2:24 the series overlap to
2:26 100% and make the Gap width say 310
2:30 10% we need to make sure that the
2:32 vertical axes are on the same scale and
2:34 we can see here that they're not so
2:36 let's fix that so this one the maximum
2:38 is going to be
2:40 14,000 in line with the left hand axis
2:43 and now that I've done that I can hide
2:45 this axis I don't actually need to see
2:47 it so let's set it to none we can also
2:50 add labels to call out the percentage
2:52 change now in column G I've inserted a
2:55 formula so this chart isn't a pivot
2:58 chart it's just a regular chart and
3:00 that's going to enable me to reference
3:02 these cells in my data labels so I want
3:05 to add data labels to the 2020
3:08 Series so let's go into more options and
3:12 here on the label options I want to
3:15 deselect the value and instead I'm going
3:17 to use value from cells and select these
3:20 cells with the variance that I've
3:22 calculated let's set them to a blue
3:25 color I'm going to go with a slightly
3:26 darker shade to the column just because
3:29 font often is hard to read if it's in a
3:31 pale color and you can't really tell
3:34 that it's that much different making the
3:36 labels blue helps the reader associate
3:39 those labels with the blue
3:41 columns I'm also going to insert a text
3:44 box for the percentage change Legend
3:47 remember this isn't part of the chart so
3:50 I'm going to set that to the same blue
3:51 color and let's reduce the font size so
3:53 it's in line with the other Legend items
3:56 and I'm just going to select the outer
3:58 edge of the text box and then remove the
4:01 outline so that it looks like it's part
4:04 of the legend can maybe move it a little
4:06 bit
4:07 closer so that's one option to highlight
4:10 the variances you're and let's look at
4:13 another if you want to focus just on the
4:16 variance then another option is to plot
4:19 the change year on year and we can do
4:21 this in a pivot table if we look at the
4:23 field list you can see I'm just showing
4:26 the sales data in my value area but I
4:29 can change what's displayed by right
4:31 clicking show values as and then I want
4:35 percentage difference
4:37 from here I want the base field to be
4:40 the years and the base item is the
4:43 previous year and now I have the
4:45 percentage change year on year and I can
4:48 plot that in a chart so let's insert a
4:51 column chart close that
4:53 down let's remove the field buttons I'll
4:57 do a little bit of formatting the first
5:00 thing I want to do is move this axis so
5:02 that it's down so that it sits at the
5:04 bottom of the chart so in the labels I
5:07 want to set it low I'm also going to
5:10 hide my vertical axis because instead of
5:13 having the axis I'm going to add data
5:16 labels just for the percentages and
5:19 let's format this number so that it has
5:21 no decimal
5:23 places and that will just make the
5:24 labels a bit cleaner as well now a
5:27 little bit more tidying up to do let's
5:29 reduce the Gap width to say 30% that'll
5:32 make the columns wider we can make the
5:34 chart a bit bigger I'll get rid of the
5:37 grid lines because we don't need them we
5:38 have the labels tells us the exact
5:41 percentage difference now you might need
5:43 to move some of the labels so that
5:46 they're not overlapping one another so
5:47 just left click twice to select the one
5:50 you want and then holding down shift
5:52 will keep it aligned vertically while
5:54 you drag it up let's do the same for
5:57 this one
5:58 here and the others aren't too bad we
6:01 could make the columns a bit wider or
6:02 make the chart a bit wider that just
6:04 gives us a bit more space the other
6:07 thing I like to do is give more meaning
6:09 to the legend and we can do that by
6:11 editing the column labels so here we
6:13 want 2019 to
6:15 2020 and this one's 2020 to
6:21 2021 let's put the legend at the
6:24 top and I'm going to get rid of 2019
6:28 because it doesn't have any later in the
6:29 chart so just selecting it and press
6:32 delete so there we have a chart that
6:34 only shows the variances and the
6:36 percentage variance to the previous
6:39 year I hope you found these techniques
