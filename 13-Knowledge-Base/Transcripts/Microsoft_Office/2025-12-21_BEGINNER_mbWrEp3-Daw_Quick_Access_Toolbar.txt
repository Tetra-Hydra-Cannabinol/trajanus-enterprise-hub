0:00 There's a powerful, time-saving tool in Excel
that is right in front of you, yet few people
0:05 use it to its full potential. Today, I'm going
to show you how this simple tool can dramatically
0:11 speed up your Excel workflow. Plus, I've gathered
some must-have shortcuts specifically for this
0:16 tool straight from our community to help turn
you into a productivity powerhouse. That said,
0:23 I don't agree with all of them. Controversial, I
know, and I'll explain why when we come to them.
0:29 At the top of the Excel window is the Quick
Access Toolbar, or QAT for short, and it's about
0:34 to become your new best friend, even if you prefer
keyboard shortcuts over using the mouse, because
0:40 I'll show you a hidden way you can leverage it
with keyboard shortcuts. Most Excel users fall
0:46 into one of three groups when it comes to the QAT.
They might use it, but not to its full potential.
0:52 They might put the wrong shortcuts there, wasting
the most valuable real estate in Excel. Or worse,
0:58 they ignore it altogether. Don't feel bad. Even
advanced users who've been using Excel for years
1:05 often overlook it. But when you customize it
with your most-used tools, suddenly it's like
1:10 having a remote control for Excel. No more
endless clicking through menus or searching
1:15 for commands. It's all right there, ready to
go. It's super quick to set up and modify.
1:21 Let's take a look. To the right of the
QAT is this tiny down arrow. Clicking it,
1:27 you get a dropdown containing a list of common
commands you can quickly add to the QAT. The ones
1:32 with the checkmarks are already included. Now
another way you can add commands to the QAT is
1:37 by right-clicking a command on the ribbon. For
example, I often want the Selection Pane open,
1:42 but it's usually multiple clicks to find it, so
we can add it to the QAT by clicking on "Find
1:48 and Select." There's my Selection Pane.
Right-click "Add to Quick Access Toolbar"
1:54 and now it's available for me anytime I
need it. I can also remove commands from
1:58 the QAT by right-clicking on them, and
then "Remove from Quick Access Toolbar."
2:03 Now, sometimes there are commands that are not
included in the ribbon, which you can find by
2:07 clicking on the down arrow and then going
into "More Commands." In the left panel,
2:13 you have a list of commands that you can add to
the QAT that defaults to show the most popular
2:18 commands. Clicking on this dropdown here allows
you to switch to various different groups of
2:23 commands, or search by ribbon or even contextual
ribbon tabs. I'll filter for commands not in the
2:30 ribbon. Now they're sorted alphabetically in
this list, and you can jump to a section by
2:35 typing in the first letter or letters of the
command's name. Now you'll mostly find legacy
2:40 features in this group, but there are also some
handy commands that are buried in dialog boxes,
2:46 like superscript and subscript here. Select the
item, click "Add," and now it's in your QAT. Now,
2:53 once you've got your favorite commands in the QAT,
you can use up and down arrows here to rearrange
2:58 the order just how you want. Be sure to put your
most-used commands in the first nine positions,
3:04 and you'll see why soon, then click "OK." And
now I've got superscript in my QAT as well.
3:11 Now, by default, the QAT sits above the ribbon in
the header, but you can right-click and show the
3:16 Quick Access Toolbar below the ribbon. In this
position, the icons have more space to include
3:21 the icon name and they're closer to the action of
the grid, but it also reduces the amount of grid
3:27 real estate because now we've got this extra row
of icons. So it's a trade-off. For me, I prefer
3:34 to have it above the ribbon and maximize the
amount of grid space I have visible on my screen.
3:40 Okay, we're ready for our Excel community's
top nine recommendations for icons to include
3:46 in your QAT. I don't agree with some of them, and
I'll tell you why. Let's take a look. First up is
3:52 "Paste Values," one of the most frequently used
commands, so it's no surprise that it's at the
3:57 top of the list. Though I'm personally not a fan
of taking up space on the QAT for this, however,
4:04 I probably won't convince everyone to skip it.
So let's start by showing you how to add it,
4:08 because this one's a little tricky. Now just copy
a cell to enable the Paste Special dropdown. And
4:14 here we've got "Values." Right-clicking on
this and adding the gallery to the Quick
4:18 Access Toolbar doesn't do what you think.
It just adds the Paste Special dropdown,
4:24 which for most of us, we really just want
this "Values" button. And if we hover over it,
4:29 we can see it's called "Values," and that's
important. So let's right-click and remove this
4:33 from the Quick Access Toolbar. And instead,
we're going to go in and customize the Quick
4:38 Access Toolbar. From the dropdown here I'm
going to go to "All Commands" and then start
4:44 typing in "Values." If I scroll down; you can see
"Values." "Paste Values" is here. Let's add it
4:51 and click "OK." And now we've got the proper
"Paste Values" button available on the QAT.
4:58 Now the reason I don't think this icon is
worthy of the QAT is because 365 users can
5:03 use the new keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+V.
If you have earlier versions of Excel,
5:08 then you can use Ctrl+Alt+V. This opens
the Paste Special dialog box. Press "V"
5:14 for values and then press Enter to click
"OK." Now obviously you need to choose
5:19 whether the three keystrokes are more
effort than using your mouse. Personally,
5:23 I don't think so because you'll get very
quick at those keystrokes. But it's up to you.
5:28 If you work with objects like shapes,
icons, images, charts, that type of thing,
5:34 you may find it frustrating selecting these
objects one by one, especially if they're
5:39 layered on top of each other like I have here with
these arrows. Instead, you can go to the Home tab,
5:45 "Find and Select," and then convert your
mouse into "Selecting Objects." And then
5:50 when I left-click and drag, all I need to do is
completely surround the objects with my mouse,
5:57 and now they're all selected. And this is
something I use regularly, so I've added it to my
6:01 QAT. You can exit Select Objects mode by clicking
the icon again or just pressing the Escape key.
6:09 If you're like me and you want everything
consistent, the Format Painter on your QAT
6:12 is a great addition. It allows you to select
a formatted range, click the Format Painter,
6:18 and quickly apply it to another set of cells. Now,
this one you can add to the Quick Access Toolbar
6:23 by right-clicking, "Add to Quick Access
Toolbar," and then with a single click,
6:28 you can use it once. With a double-click, you can
use it multiple times, and then when you're done,
6:34 press Escape to exit. Now, because this
command really needs to be used with the mouse,
6:39 don't worry about giving it one of
the top nine positions on your QAT.
6:43 This next one I don't agree with—it's "Save
As." Now, I don't disagree that saving a copy
6:49 of a file is super common, so it makes
sense that you want a shortcut for it.
6:54 But the keyboard shortcut for this is the
F12 key, and it doesn't get much simpler
6:59 than that. The other benefit of using the F12
key to save a copy of your file is it opens
7:06 the old "File > Save As" dialog box instead of
the clunky backstage area. So a good command
7:13 to add to your QAT instead of "Save As", for
those who use Power Query, and you should,
7:19 is the "Launch Power Query Editor" window
icon. You can see I've got it here.
7:24 Now normally, you have to go to the Data tab,
click on "Get Data," and then launch the Power
7:29 Query Editor. Or if you have queries
in your file, you can right-click the
7:34 query in the Connection pane here and go into
Edit. But notice in just right-clicking it,
7:41 it's jumped me to the sheet with my query, and
it selected the query. Now, a lot of the time,
7:46 I want to reference another sheet in my
file while I'm in the Query Editor. So this
7:51 right-click technique here is super annoying.
Instead of that, if you have the "Launch Power
7:57 Query Editor window" icon on your QAT, you can
jump into the Query Editor, select your query,
8:04 and then see the worksheet behind the
Query Editor window at the same time.
8:09 By the way, if you're finding this useful and
you want to dive even deeper into mastering
8:14 Excel with support and mentoring from me
personally, check out my courses over at
8:19 MyOnlineTrainingHub.com. They cover all the
tips and tricks you need to know to become
8:25 a true Excel pro. I'll leave a link in the video
description and pinned comment, so check it out.
8:31 Filtering data is probably something you do all
the time, so adding the "Filter" and "Remove
8:36 Filter" commands to your Quick Access Toolbar
makes managing larger datasets much faster. You
8:42 find them on the Data tab of the ribbon. We've got
"Filter" and "Clear Filter" here. Just right-click
8:47 to add them; you can see mine's already available
on the Quick Access Toolbar, so this option is
8:52 grayed out. And this "Clear Filter" button works
for tables and pivot tables. Now, if you need one
8:57 of these prime locations for another command, you
might prefer to learn the keyboard shortcut for
9:02 applying filters, which is Ctrl+Shift+L,
and that will save you an icon position.
9:07 This next one I absolutely cannot justify—it's
"Merge & Center." I've ranted about this format
9:14 so many times that I won't go there again
now. Instead of using "Merge & Center"
9:19 and causing problems for yourself, select
the cells that you want to merge the title
9:24 across, press Ctrl+1 to open the Format
Cells dialog box. On the Alignment tab,
9:29 under the dropdown for Horizontal, select "Center
Across Selection." It's a bit more work to apply,
9:36 and unfortunately, there's no button on your QAT
for it, but it's worth these extra steps. In fact,
9:43 if you use it a lot, write a macro to apply
it and add a macro button to your QAT.
9:48 Now I'm on the fence about this next one—it's
"Freeze Panes," which is available on the View
9:53 tab, and then "Freeze Panes," and you'll find
it here. While I think this is a great tool,
9:58 I'm just not sure you use it often enough
to justify it on the QAT. I guess if you
10:02 toggle it off and on regularly, then that
would make sense. But applying it once when
10:06 you create the file? Probably not. If
you do want "Freeze Panes" on your QAT,
10:11 then right-clicking on it is going to add this
gallery to the Quick Access Toolbar so you get
10:15 all three icons in this dropdown, which is
probably not what you want. So remember,
10:20 right-click "Customize the Quick Access Toolbar."
Click on the dropdown here and select "All
10:25 Commands" and then type it in to search for
it. There it is there; click "Add" and "OK."
10:33 Simple yet absolutely essential commands
are "Undo" and "Redo." Now, I know these
10:39 have the shortcut keys Ctrl+Z for Undo and
Ctrl+Y or F4 to redo, which everyone knows,
10:46 but being able to click on the dropdown and undo
or redo in bulk is a game changer, so be sure to
10:52 turn these on from the default commands in
the dropdown here if they're not already.
10:58 Finally, if you're someone who
juggles multiple Excel files,
11:01 then "Switch Windows," available on the View
tab, allows you to quickly jump between your
11:06 windows without having to search for
them amongst all your other apps. You
11:10 can right-click and add it to the Quick Access
Toolbar, and then it's available there. However,
11:17 you can also use Ctrl+Tab to quickly jump
between your windows, and that's my preference.
11:22 Seeing that I kiboshed a few of these, let's
look at one more that is probably my most-used
11:27 shortcut, and that is "Clear All." You'll find
it on the Home tab of the ribbon over here in
11:32 the Editing dropdown. We've got "Clear All";
you've also got "Clear Formats," which might
11:37 be handy if you do that a lot. Now that we've
added all these tools to our Quick Access Toolbar,
11:42 you can make them even faster to use with Alt-key
shortcuts. This is one of those "Why didn't I
11:48 know this sooner?" tricks that will change
how you use Excel. Every icon in your Quick
11:53 Access Toolbar automatically gets an Alt-key
shortcut assigned to it, and the best part is,
11:58 you don't even need to memorize anything. You
just press the Alt key, and Excel will display
12:03 a number for each tool. Here you can see that my
"Launch Query Editor" icon is number 9. All I need
12:10 to do now is press 9, and it opens the Query
Editor. Now, if you have more than nine icons,
12:16 as you can see I do, the next set of icons start
with 09, 08, 07, so on and so forth. For example,
12:23 if I want to open the Selection Pane, which is
09, I just press 09 on my keyboard, and now it's
12:29 available on the right. Once you've used these
commands a few times, you'll have them memorized.
12:35 Now you've got your Quick Access Toolbar all
set up with your favorite tools and shortcuts,
12:39 and it's basically become your personal command
center. But what if you switch computers or
12:45 have to reinstall Excel? Don't worry, you won't
have to go through all the setup all over again,
12:49 because there's a simple way to save and
transfer your custom toolbar setup. Right-click
12:54 on the Quick Access Toolbar, "Customize Quick
Access Toolbar," and then down at the bottom,
13:00 we've got "Import and Export." You want
to export all customizations and save
13:06 this file somewhere safe, like on a USB drive
or cloud storage. And then, any time you need
13:11 to set up the toolbar on a different computer,
simply come back here, click on the dropdown,
13:16 and import your customization file, and
you're back in business in just a few clicks.
13:21 So now your Quick Access Toolbar is
all set up. I'm sure you're excited
13:25 for the productivity boost, but there's
one Excel trick that I use literally
13:29 every single day, and it makes working
in Excel so much easier. I honestly think
13:34 everyone should be using it, so click on
this video next, and I'll see you there.
