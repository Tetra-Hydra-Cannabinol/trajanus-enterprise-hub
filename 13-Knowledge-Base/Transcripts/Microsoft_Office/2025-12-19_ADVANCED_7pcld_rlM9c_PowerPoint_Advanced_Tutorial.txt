### Result
"Don't forget to like and subscribe! Hello and welcome to Microsoft PowerPoint\nadvanced. You're learning with Mo Jones, IT\nprofessional and educator for our advanced course\nwe have two modules. So module three and module four. For module three\nwe'll take a look at how we can customize the PowerPoint environment. We'll take a look\nat how we can customize design templates. It's all about the slide master. We'll save the design as a template. But we can either share or reuse\nover and over again. We'll also go ahead and take a look\nat creating infographics with smart art. No need to search the web\nfor infographics, we can make our own. There's\nan extensive library of capabilities right here inside of Microsoft PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and dive in. Please open up the PowerPoint module\nthree exercise file and come right back. We'll dive right into customizing\nthe PowerPoint environment. Looking to support our channel\nand get a great deal. Become a member today to unlock ad free\nvideos.

I currently have my model three\npractice file open here. And here we have a few slides. And here is lesson\none custom sizing the environment. So one of the things I will do is we'll\ngo ahead and create our own ribbon tab. And then we'll add our own commands to it. And then we'll also go ahead\nand set some global options. Just some useful options\nthat may help us as well. In particular, what I would like to do is\nadd some of these tools that will help me as I'm designing my presentation,\nsuch as the animation pane, the beloved eyedropper,\nthe selection pane that helps us to organize objects on a slide,\nand of course, the slide master. So to do that right now, in order to get to the eyedropper,\nI could add it to my Quick Access toolbar. That's one thing that I can do. Or I need to be interacting\nwith an object, and then I can go ahead and pull up\nthe eyedropper from there as well. Or if I don't feel like clicking\non the contextual tab, clicking on Shape\nFill, and clicking on the eyedropper. Well, let's\ngo ahead and add our own ribbon tab. We're going to right\nclick on any one of these tabs, and just click on the option\nthat says Customize the Ribbon. So I'll click on Customize the Ribbon. We get to this PowerPoint options dialog. And on the left we can see that\nwe can customize the ribbon. Here are all the commands. Well at least the popular commands. I'm going to change this to all commands, so I'll change this to all commands. Now I can see all the commands\nthat are in PowerPoint over here on the right. I can see that I have some,\nI can see the tabs that I have here. So for example, here's the home tab. And the home\ntab has the clipboard command group paragraph so forth and so on. Well I want to create my own. As you can see I do have a couple\nof pre-made ones here as well. So for example\nI created a tab called My Designs. And let's see what that looks like here. So when I created this tab it comes with a tab and then a command group. And then I have my commands down here as well. I going to turn this on. Let's see what this looks like here. And then we'll go ahead and recreate it. So if I enable that I'll go ahead and find it\nhere on my ribbon. Here it is my designs. So now if I click on my designs\nI can quickly access the animation pane. I can turn on the eyedropper right away and apply a particular color to that content placeholder there. If I want to. And I can also turn on the selection pane. Take a look at all\nthe different objects on my slide. I can also access the slide master\nright from here as well. So that's what we can do. So let's go ahead and create our own. Let's go back\nto customize the ribbon here. And to do that the first thing we need to do\nis click on the new tab option here. So we'll click on new tab. So here is our new tab right here has a generic name new tab. It has a generic command group. Let's go ahead and rename both of those. So for the new tab I'll click on rename. Maybe I'll call that design 24. Go ahead and press okay. And for the command group\nI'll rename that as well. I'll click on rename. You can also choose an icon if you want to go ahead\nand choose this here. And the displayed name\nis going to be called Design Tools. Go ahead and press okay. So I'm going to go have my design tab. Here's my command group. The next thing for me to do\nis to go ahead and actually add commands to that particular command group. So I want to make sure I have design tools\nselected here. And I'll change the commands\nfrom popular commands to all commands. So now what I can do is I can type\nthe letter E. This will bring me down to the E commands. I want to look for the eyedropper. Here\nit is. I'll add the eyedropper in there so we can see how this works. So here's level one, which is the actual tab, level two, which is the command group. And then we have level three\nwhich is the actual command. So let's go ahead and add some more. I'm going to go ahead\nand add the slide master. So I'll type the letter S\nand I'll look for the slide master here. And again you can pretty much add any any command that you want. I'll just click on Slide Master. I'll also turn on the selection pane. And here we go. I'll add that and I'll keep it\nsimple I'll just add one more. I'll go back to the group\nand I'll add the animation pane. And I'm good to go. Here are my four commands. I'll press okay. And I'll go ahead and locate design 24. Here it is right here. And from here I can go ahead. And I could even create\nanother command group name that add my own commands in here as well. I can keep going as well. So that's what we want to do. So go ahead and customize your ribbon. Go ahead and create a ribbon tab. Rename the command group. Go ahead and add some commands\nthere as well. And come right back. Now that we are able\nto create our own tab. So here are my two tabs here. The next thing we can do\nis turn on some useful options. I'll go back here. I'll right\nclick on any of these ribbon tabs and I'll go back to customizing\nthe ribbon. This brings me to the PowerPoint options\ndialog here. So I'll go back to the general here. And some of these\nare turned on by default. But I find these to be pretty helpful\nwhen you're designing your presentation. So the first tab here on the general tab I can see that\nI have some user interface options. Now if you're using two monitors,\nyou may notice that when you move your application\nfrom one window to the next, you may have\nsome appearance issues here as well. So you may want to go ahead and optimize for best appearance\nwhen you're using multiple displays. If you just kind of hover\nover the little information icon, it gives you some more information\nup here as well. All right. So you can toggle it back\nand forth, optimize for compatibility or optimize for best appearance. I like the mini toolbar on selection. This is pretty much\nwhenever you highlight a chunk of text. It gives you the mini tool that allows you\nto do some quick formatting. A big part of designing in PowerPoint\nis live preview. So for example, before we apply a\nparticular style or some type of feature, we can get a preview\njust by hovering the mouse over it. So I'd like to leave\nthat turned on there as well. For those\nof us who like to collapse the ribbon, remember we can always change the ribbon\ndisplay options. I like to see the full ribbon,\nso I'm good to go. You may want to collapse the Microsoft\nsearch box. As you can see, I do have it over here. It is currently minimized and this allows me a little more room\nif I'm using my Quick Access toolbar. I have some more room over here\nto work with as well. So I can do that if I want to. I'll scroll down a little bit. Here's the PowerPoint designer. So when you're designing\nyou're either using the A theme, you're using the slide master,\nor you're using the PowerPoint designer. I have it turned off right now\nbecause I'm going to be using the slide master to design my presentation as well. If we go down to the save and go down to the preserve fidelity\nwhen sharing this presentation, if you're using special fonts\nin your presentation, if you're a recipient does not have\nthat particular font or set of fonts,\nthey will not be displayed properly. So you may want to embed\nthe fonts in the file so that even though they don't have those fonts installed, they will\nstill be able to view them as well. So that's another nice option\nto be able to use. There. The other ones here. In terms of advanced when it comes to printing,\nwe can print true type fonts as graphics. So that's another nice option\nthere as well. And that we can use. And of course\nif we go to the Quick access toolbar here, just like how we can add any command\nto the the ribbon tab that we created. Here are the current commands\nthat are on my Quick Access toolbar. But I\ndo have access to the entire library. So if I change this to all commands,\nI can add any command to my quick access toolbar. And because I minimize\nthe search box here, I have a lot of room over here to be able\nto add some of those commands as well. So those are just some options\nthat may help you as you continue\nto create designs in PowerPoint. Let's move on to lesson\ntwo designing with the Slide Master. Now what is the slide master? Let's go ahead and take a look\nat the slide master to get there I need to go ahead and click on the view\ntab and get to the actual slide master. Once I'm there,\nI can do something like insert a layout. I can rename a layout and I can insert content placeholders\nas well. Let's do something simple in the slide\nmaster. Let's go ahead and make universal changes\nto our entire presentation. For example, we often do this for each slide. Maybe we want to go ahead\nand change the title. Maybe we want to go ahead and do something\nlike change the font. Now go for this one and change the color. And then go ahead and change the size. We go to our next slide. We do the same thing. Well we don't have to do that. Instead of going to every single slide\nand changing the formatting options for all of our title placeholders,\nwe can do that in the slide master. So go ahead and undo all those changes\nor press Ctrl Z a few times here. Now back to normal. Let's head on over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab. And once I'm on the view tab\nall the way to the far left, we'll see the slide master. Let's hover over the slide Master\nand see what it says. So Slide Master, it controls\nthe look of your entire presentation, including colors, fonts, backgrounds,\neffects, and just about everything else. So I can insert a shape or a logo and it will show up on all of my slides\nautomatically. Well, that sounds pretty good. Now go ahead and click on the slide\nmaster here. Now here we can notice\nthat we have a different view. Now we are in the slide master view. We can see that\nwe now have the slide master tab. And we have some command groups here\nthat are specific to our slide master. Now important to note on the left\nwe'll have different types of slides. What I want to do\nis scroll all the way to the top here. And you'll notice\nall the way at the very top, we'll notice that a slide\nis bigger than all of our other slides. So in fact,\nthis is the actual slide master. The other slides that we see here. These are the different layouts. So here's the title and content layout. Here's the two content layout. Here's the comparison layout. So that's what that is. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on the actual slide master here. And let's just get a good understanding\nof how this works. So whatever changes\nI've made to this slide it's going to affect all of my slides\nregardless of what type of layout it is. So I'm just going to do something simple. I'll go ahead and I want all of my title slides to be a particular font\ncolor and size. So I'll go ahead and highlight these. I'll go back to the home tab and I'll go ahead and apply\nthe formatting there. Once we apply the formatting\nwe'll close the slide master and take a look\nand see how our slides have been updated. Okay I'll change this font here. I'm going to go with the Georgia font. Right. So here's Georgia and I want it to be\nthat nice Georgia Blue. And I'll make it 40. And that's it. Now if you take a look you'll notice. Take a look at my different layouts. So here's the title slide. We can see that the title slide is already incorporating\nthat formatting that I just applied. Here's the title and content slide layout. We can see it's also incorporating that format that I've made to the slide\nmaster. Let's go back to the slide Master. Let's go ahead and close the master view. This will put our presentation\nback to the original or normal view. And let's take a look to see\nif our slides were updated. And we can see that they were. So here's my title slide. Here's slide number two. So all of my slides now have that universal\nformatting for my title. Let's take a step further. Let's go back into the slide master. And let's see what else we can do here. Again I want to make sure I click on that\nvery top slide here. And what I'm going to do\nis for all of my level I want to change my bullets actually. I want to highlight\nthese five bullet levels here. And I'll go to the home tab. And instead of having those regular bullets, maybe I want something\nlike hollow squares. So I'll go ahead and choose how squares. And for my level one item,\nmaybe I want that to be, let's say orange. My level two items on the list. Maybe I want that to be. I'll go with purple. That's it. Let's go ahead and analyze our slides and see if it incorporates\nthese formatting changes. I'll go back to the slide master. I'll click on Close Master View and look at that. All of my level\none bullet points are orange. And it has the hollow squares\nhere as well. If I go back to slide number two we can see all of those formatting changes\nhave been applied here. The title Georgia 40 blue level one orange with the squares level two bullet items or list items purple with the other square as well. So those are some of the universal changes\nthat we can make with the slide master. Now just one more thing to note. I'll go back into the slide master here. So I have two options. What I did initially is\nI chose the master slide. So this applies the formatting\nto every single slide. What if I only wanted to make some changes\nto my. Let's see if I hover over this one. So this is title and content. It's currently being used by slides\n2 to 3 and 5 to 7. So if I wanted to format\nonly this particular slide layout I can do that here as well. So for my third level here\nI'll go ahead and make this. let's see I'll make this green. Like that. It's only going to affect my title and content layout. So let's go back here. I'll close the master view. And so this is a let's see lesson one. This is a title and content. Let's add a third level item. And there you go. We can see that it's already. It's already green. If I go to a nother layout let's see. Do I have a two content layout in here. Well let's just insert a two content layout slide. Okay. So here's level one. Here's level two and here's level three. So we can see that level three item only applies\nto that particular type of slide. So we can either make universal changes\nto the entire presentation or to specific slides as well. Go ahead and make some simple changes\nin the slide master and preview it and come right back. Let's continue fun with the slide master. Well, what I want to do\nnow is create a custom slide layout. If I click on New Slide\nhere, here are the different layouts that are available\nbased on the current theme that I'm using. Now, I don't have the particular layout\nthat I'm looking for. Basically\nwhat I want is the three content layout. So I have title and content. I have two content. I want a slide that has three columns\nwhere I can easily express three concepts of three main keys\nor three main ideas here. So I don't have one. So what I can do is create my own layout. Let's go ahead and do that. I'll click on the view tab here\nand I'll click on the slide master. Now I have two options. I can either\njust kind of duplicate an existing slide and just make a basic update. Or I can insert a new layout. I'll keep it simple. I'll use it\nbased on the two content layout here. So in the slide master\nI'll click on the two content layout. So we have two content here. But I want three. So what I'm going to do\nis duplicate the slide and just resize these placeholders. And place one here in the middle. So I'm going to right\nclick on this layout. And I'll choose the duplicate layout option here. I can see it's duplicated. It's the exact replica of the one above. So on the duplicated layout\nI want to rename it first. So we'll duplicate it, rename it, and then we'll go ahead and format it. So I'll right click on it. I'll choose rename. I can also click right here to rename it. I'll right click I'll rename\nI'll call this one three content. I'll press rename. And I'm good to go. So now what I can do\nI can just go ahead and resize these. So I'll go ahead and grab the content\nplaceholder on the left here. And I'm just going to resize it. I do have the footers down here\nin the bottom, so I'll make sure it's the same width\nas my footers one on the right. I'll grab the resize handle\nand I'll snap it to that footer on the bottom right here. Now I have space in the middle\nto put a a bigger one. I can resize them,\nmake them all the same size if I want to, but I'll just insert\none here in the middle. So to do that I'll click on where\nit says insert placeholder. So under the master layout command group under the slide master\nI'll insert a placeholder. Now here are the different placeholders\nthat we can insert the content. Basically we can add anything\ntext picture chart, table, smart art media text is just for text\nonly picture chart table. Well I want a content placeholder\nthat can pretty much add anything. So I'll click on content. And just like a text box\nI have to draw it. So I'll go ahead and draw it here. We can always resize it later. Right now\nI just want to use those temporary guides to make sure they're the same height\nas the other two. And I'll snap this right here. And I think I like\nto go ahead and center align my title as well. So there we go. Let's go ahead and close the master view. Let's go ahead and insert this slide. And let's\nsee what this slide layout looks like. So now how do I find it. If I click on new slide. I can see here is my three content layout. So pretty pretty cool. So now I can always use this slide\nlayout whenever I want to. I'll go ahead and insert that here. And there it is. So I can add my title. And I have my content placeholder here on the left middle and on the right. So pretty. Pretty nice as well. Go ahead and create a three content\nlayout. Go ahead and insert it into your\npresentation and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead for lesson two. Let's go ahead and create a custom slide that we can use over and over again. I'm going to head on over\nto my title slide. Now I did insert P\nimage on my title slide. The reason I do that is because I want to\ngain some insights from the designer. So the designer really likes pictures. So if you add an image to your slide,\nyou'll get some more vibrant looking options here as well. I'm not going to insert any of them. I just want to get some insights in terms of what is modern\nand what looks pretty cool. So we can see tends to put either big picture left, big picture right or even a big picture on the top, and then add our title\nand subtitle here as well. So these look pretty good. I'm going to go ahead\nand create an actual slide. Let's see see more designs. Now we can see how we actually break down\nthis particular slide here. So how can we recreate a slide like this. This slide basically we have a picture. We have what looks like a either a shape or a text box. Here. We have a triangle\nshape down here as well. That's pretty much what these are. They're a combination of content\nplaceholders, images and different types of shapes. Now when you create a custom\nslide in the slide master, when you're actually insert that slide,\nyou will not be able to interact with the picture or any of the other objects\nthat you insert on there. Let's go ahead and head on\nover to the slide master. I'll close the designer here. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to Slide Master. Now what I want to do is\nI want to go ahead and insert a layout. If I hover over, that tells me that I can add a custom\nlayout to the master slide set. Once it's created, I can easily add slides that match the new layout\nto my presentation. Well, I'll go ahead and click on Insert\nLayout here. And we can see that\nit inserted a new layout for us. All it has on here is just the title. It's blank. We have the the footers down here as well. They custom message\nand page number in here. I'm going to rename this right away. Again I want this to be a custom\ntitle slide that I can reuse over and over again. So I'll right click on here and I'll rename this layout\nand I'll call this one title two. And there we go. So I'm going to I think what I will want\nis a big picture on the top. And then I want my title on the bottom\nright. And then my subtitle. Maybe I'll go ahead and add a logo\nover here as well. So that's what I'll do. So to do that\nI'll go ahead and click on the insert tab. I'll look for a stock image. And I want something related to learning. I know exactly the picture I want. So I'll scroll down. There it is. Nice chalkboard here. Beautiful colors that are in there. I'll go ahead and start that one. You can insert any picture you want. So this picture is actually very,\nvery good. It actually takes up the entire slide. Sometimes you insert a picture and it's\nmore fit to either align it to the left or to align it to the top. So I do want to\nwhat I'm going to do is crop this picture because I don't have any space down here. I do not want to overlay the text on it. So I'm going to cut out. I don't want to cut out the chairs\nthat look really nice or cut out. Maybe I'll crop the bottom and just\na little bit from the top here as well. That will give me a little bit of room\nto be able to add my title, subtitle and my logo as well. So I'll click on the picture format and I'll click on the cropping tool here. There we go. And I'll crop it from the bottom up to about here. And I'll come down to about here. I'll click away from it. There we go. I'll move it up to the top here. Bam! That's pretty good. I could probably even crop it\na little more, but I'll keep it simple here. Now I want to go ahead and find my title. So my title is hiding behind my pictures. If I move my picture, I'll see my title. There. So what I'll do is\nturn on the selection pane. I can click on Picture Format\nand turn on the selection pane. I also have it under my designs here. So I'll just turn on the selection pane. I'll go ahead and locate my title. And once I have it selected\nI can use the arrow keys on my keyboard. Just move it down. I can also just bring it forward\nif I want to. But for now, I'll just go ahead and move\nit down here to the bottom. I do want to align it to the right,\nso I'll bring it to the right here. Doesn't need to be that big either. Maybe I'll go to\nabout the middle of the slide. And as far as the text, I'll make that 32. And I'll also bring it up here as well. I'm going to turn off my footers. So if I go back to the slide master\nI can toggle the footers off here. It's going to turn them off for now. Don't really need them right now. But that's pretty much how you would\ninsert footers from the slide master. So here we go. I'm going to go ahead and insert\nanother placeholder. This will be for my subtitle. So I want a text placeholder. I'll drop it down here. This is going to be just a level one item. So I'll delete\nall of the other levels here. And this is not a bulleted list. I'll use my quick toolbar here to remove the bullets. And as far as a text,\nI want to pick up one of the colors from the picture here,\nso I'll use the eyedropper and I'll pull in the color here as well. So I'm good to go. That looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and align\nthis a little more. Right now I'll go ahead and insert a I'll insert an icon. Something to do with learning. I'll go ahead and grab this one. So this is another type of object. And this one is giving me\nissue issues as well. So I'll click on the graphic. I use my arrow keys\nto kind of move that around here. And maybe what I'll do is aligned that to the. To the bottom and then to the left. Here. I'm good to go. If I wanted to do something else\nI got a little accent. I could do that. So I'll just insert a shape\nto kind of show what that looks like. I'll, put a little. Let's see. Let me just a line. I'll draw a line right through here. There we go. All right. That looks pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and close these. The slide master. Now let's go ahead and insert that. So I'll click on New Slide. And here's my title to if I insert that\nthat's what it looks like. And it looks pretty good. So if I wanted to make any changes\nI can simply go back into the slide master,\nclick on the slide and move things around. But here I can go ahead and add my content. And I'll say Community Day. And I'll say something like learn with us as well. Notice\nI cannot interact with the icon here, or that line shape or that picture. The only things I can interact with\nare the content placeholders. So when you're designing,\nif you add any shapes or images or any objects that remain flat\non the canvas, which makes it possible for us to create these types of designs\nhere as well. Go ahead and create a custom title. Make any changes if you need to. For example, if I wanted to go ahead\nand go back to the slide master. So if I wanted to maybe align my text to the right. And once I close the master view and go back, I can see now\nit's aligned to the right as well. Go ahead and insert\na custom title slide or two. Go ahead\nand insert it and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nnumber three customizing design templates. Now when you're creating a template in PowerPoint, typically\nyou're saving a couple of slide layouts. You also creating\nand saving a theme and a design as well. We want to go ahead and lock in the layout\nthat we've created so far. So if we click on New Slide,\nhere's our title, our custom title slide. And here's our three content\nlayout as well. But what if we wanted\nto make some other changes, such as change the color scheme\nthat's available, and maybe change the font\nfor the entire presentation? I did apply the Georgia font\nto all of my titles. We can see it's Georgia, but\nfor everything else, that's the default font style here for PowerPoint. So what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to go ahead and create my own theme\nby choosing my own colors and fonts. And then we'll go ahead\nand save this as a template. I'll head on over to the slide master\nand I'll click on the view tab. Go back to Slide Master. So at this point what I want to do\nI want to go ahead. I can either choose a theme. So let's preview those first. If I click here\nand I simply choose one of these themes, I can see how the theme will update\nall of my slides for me. But what if I'm not finding a theme\nthat I want? What if I want to use my own colors\nand my own fonts? Typically that's\nwhat we will do in the slide master. I'll click on the colors here, and you can see I have some different paths\nto choose from. So depending maybe on Trump,\nmaybe I'm trying to brand this presentation\nand I want a particular color set. I can go ahead and choose\none of these existing ones here as well. Additionally, if I want to,\nI can even take it a step further. I can create my own color palette. The way to do\nthat is by clicking on Customize Colors. Once you're here,\nwe just need to go ahead and name it and go ahead and choose\nall of these colors that we want. So this is typically where you would put\nyour company colors to be able to brand the presentation. Once you do that,\nit will appear in the custom area. And as you can see, I have a couple of color palettes here. Okay. Right now\nI just want to choose an existing palette. And I'm going to go ahead and I'll choose. I'll go with the. Blue to. So I've chosen my color set. Now every time I want to modify something I'll see that\nthose colors are now available. I want to choose my own font as well. So I'll go ahead and click on fonts. And I want to use the Georgia font not just for this particular slide\nbut all of my slides. So I'll scroll down to Georgia here. I'll click here. And we can see everything now is Georgia. I go back to my slide master here. I can see Georgia here as well. So basically I chose my own color palette. I chose my own font. If I want to, I can even add a an effect. I'll go for a glossy effect. These effects, they're very subtle. They appear in things like charts\nand tables and other types of visuals. Not really for text here as well. So that's it. So from here, what I can do is\nI can go ahead and lock all this. And by saving this as a template. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on the file tab. I'll go ahead and click on save as. And I can do it there if I want to. Or I can press the F12 key on my keyboard. Now once I'm in here what I need to do\nis simply change the presentation type. So I want to save the type,\nnot as a PowerPoint presentation,\nbut as a PowerPoint template. So I'll click on this drop down first. I'll scroll down to PowerPoint template. Here it is. Now notice\nwhen I change this to a template save type automatically. Jumps to the folder. The default folder that houses all of my\ncustom office templates here as well. So we don't want to change that location. The only thing we want to do\nis go ahead and rename it and press save. So I'll go ahead and leave this\nas the name. I'll press save and that's it. So this has been saved as a template. The next time I open PowerPoint right from my start screen,\nI can see that template. And now I'll have all of the colors,\nfonts, effects, slide layouts, custom slides. Any changes that I've made\nwill be locked into the template. I'm going to go ahead\nand close the master view. Then the next thing to do\nis to be able to find our templates. I'll click on the file tab here and you'll notice it appears right here on your recent files from the home\nbutton there. So what I like to do is\nI like to go ahead and pin it right away. So I will always show up on my pin files. We'll go ahead and pin that. There we go. So now it's pinned. If I click on my pin files I can see it in here. It's right here. So I can always access that file. The traditional way to access\nyour templates is to click on the new tab. Here. And when you go down we'll notice\nthat we have office templates. So this is from Microsoft's gallery. We want custom. So if I have existing templates\nclick on the new tab. Click on custom. And then I'll have my custom office\ntemplates. If I click right here here are the different templates. Here's the recent one that I created. And basically the way that this works is\nif I were to open this file, PowerPoint will produce a copy\nof that presentation for me. The original template\nwould remain untouched here as well. So that's the benefit of working\nwith a template. We can reuse it\nover and over and over again if we want to make any changes\nto the template. We can go ahead and open it\nfrom the folder structure on our computer\nand make any changes and resave it. And that template\nwill be updated here as well. So go ahead and go back into the slide\nmaster. Go ahead and choose a color scheme. Choose a font. Go ahead and save your presentation\nas a template and just confirm that you can see it in\nyour custom templates folder. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nfor creating infographics. We're going to create smart art. And then we will go ahead and modify\nsmart art. And once we're finished we'll have the\ncapability to animate smart art as well. Now what exactly is smart art? Smart art is a way of creating\ninfographics and Microsoft PowerPoint. So really, there's no need\nto search the web for an infographic. We have an extensive library in PowerPoint that you can use\nto create your own infographics. We want to get to this library\nof smart art graphics that we can create. We can see that we have different\nsections, such as if you want to express an infographic as a list,\na process cycle, so forth, and so on. What we'll talk about is how we can convert smart art from existing content. I'll also take a look at how we can go\nahead and insert a smart art graphic,\nand then add our own content to it. So an infographic is basically text\naccompanied by either shapes or images. So in this example\nI have a basic list here. Just step one, step two, and step three. Very generic. We're going to convert this into\nan infographic and we'll watch it evolve. As we do that. So I can either express my steps\nhere in the form of a bulleted list. As such or what I can do. Let me go ahead and highlight my list,\nand then I'll use Microsoft to convert this into an infographic. To do that,\nI need to first highlight my my list. And on the home tab in the paragraph\ncommand group. Here is smart art. If you hover\nover, it tells you exactly what it does. Convert text on your slide\nto a smartart graphic such as a diagram, flowchart, so forth\nand so on. If I click on the drop down,\nI see just a short list of infographics that I can create. For example, here's\nthe first one a vertical bulleted list. So as you can see, if I were to choose\nthis one, I'll get those really nice rounded rectangle shapes there\nto accompany my text. Here's\nanother type of vertical block list. So we have smaller rounded rectangles. And if we wanted to add a picture to it we can go ahead and do that here as well. So lots of different graphics in here. It's time to explore\nand see what is a available. Some of these are different. Here's an org chart. So if you want to create an organization chart\nyou can pretty much do that in PowerPoint. Here's another variation hierarchy. So we can express something as a list a hierarchy a process cycle. So lots of different options\nthat we can use here. We're going to go ahead and click on\nmore Smartart graphics. Let's take a look at the library\nto get an understanding of what we can do. So here's the full smart art library. And basically PowerPoint is asking us\nto choose a smart art graphic. Well, we can choose whether we want\nto express something as a list or something as a cycle, or even as a matrix. So different ones here\nwhen you click on the list. So in this case\nI want to express something as a process step 1 to 3 I have a basic process here. Here's a preview of what\nthis would look like. On the bottom we have a brief explanation\nof how the Smartart graphic works. Here's the second one a step up process. We have a step down process here as well. Now when you're creating an infographic,\nyou can keep it very simple or you can make it more complex. So as we can see down here,\nwe have some more complex infographics or smart art. And we can see that we have a more in-depth explanation of how this works. It's all based on levels. So when you're creating a list,\nit's all based on level one, 2 or 3 items. So different smart art graphics\nwill incorporate different levels. Some. Some only allow 1 or 2. Some will allow more than two as well. For for relations\nwe can see we have some really complex ones in here, such as a balance scale. And we have a lot of verbiage here\nkind of explaining how that works. So what I'd like for you to do,\ngo ahead and highlight your text and then go ahead and try out some of the different smart arts. We can always change it\nonce we select one. So if I select the vertical bullet list here,\nI can always change it a little later. So go ahead and check them out. If you're feeling adventurous, click\non the more smart art graphics here and take a look at the different options\nthat are available and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and create an infographic\nhere. We're going to go ahead and highlight\nmy text and go on to. I'll start\nwith a vertical bullet list here. Now when you start with your smart\nart graphic you'll notice that we have\na smart Art design contextual tab. So just like all of the other objects,\nwe can change the layout. We can change the style. So as you can see we have a white outline. We have a glossy effect here\na shadowy effect. So there's a lot of different things\nthat we can do here. We can change the colors. And over here on the far\nleft is where we can basically control our smart art graphic. So if we wanted to add another shape\nor move things around, we can do that as well. But I want to introduce it\nto our little text pane here on the left. And basically this is how I prefer\nto manage my Smartart graphic. So again it's based on the levels here. I only have level one items in here. If you're not seeing this text pane, just make sure to go ahead\nand click on this little arrow here. And this will open\nup the text pane for you. So I'll click here and there we go. If I wanted to do something like add\nanother step I can just add another bullet there. And as you can see it's already adding\nthat fourth shape for me. So if I say step four. I can do that as well. Now if I continue working with the list,\nif I press the enter key after step one and I press tab over. So now I have a level two item. The level two item has its own\nnot really a shape, but just a small area here\nthat we can use. So I want to keep it simple. I'm going to remove step four. So I'll delete step four from my list. You'll notice the shape goes away. And for step one I'm just going to go ahead and put a level\ntwo item for each of my steps. Here. So I'll keep it simple here. And as a matter of fact if I already had a bulleted list\nI can copy and paste it in here. If I wanted to. And that will actually create the smartart\ngraphic for me as well. But for here, I'll keep it simple. I'll just go with a project management template here. So I'll define the project. Step two. I'll tap over and I'll say identify stakeholders. And for step number three I'll go ahead and add tasks. So that's how the smart art graphic works. So we have three here. So that's a simple way\nthat we can modify it. Now what I can do\nif you want to move things around well what you can do\nis click on one of the shapes here. And on the smart art design tab over here\non the far left. This is where we can do things\nlike move this down on the list, or we can move it up, or we can promote\nor demote, or we can add a shape. So we can either manage the list here to manage the smart art, or we can use the Create Graphic command\ngroup to manage the smart art as well. So for example, if I wanted to move step\none down, notice how it moves the level one\nand the level two item down as well. I can go ahead and move that back up. And maybe I want to promote the fine project as a level one item. So it does it here. And it gives gives its own shape as well. I'll go ahead and move that\nand I'm good to go. So that's the basics of how we use the text pane to modify smart art. Now let's take a look at something else\nhere. Let's click on the smart Art design tab. And what if I want to change the colors. I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll click on the color palette here. And we have three options\nfor the primary colors based on the theme\nthat we currently have selected. Just get\nthe preview, see what that looks like. And then we have five colorful palettes\nto choose from. So these are all incorporating the accent colors\nbased on the theme that you have selected. If I scroll down we have different\nvariations of each accent color. So it's really up to you\nwhat you want to use. I typically like\nto use the colorful scheme here as well. Once we change the colors,\nwe can head on over to smart art styles. And as you can see,\nthere's a few styles to choose from here. The first one gives a white outline\nand a little shadow as well. So that makes it look pretty nice. And then we have a subtle effect. Here's the moderate effect. And it gets more intense\nas we go to the right. So this one has a gloss. And it also has a shadow. And we have polished and gets a little more interesting\nas we go through here as well. So different orientations\nof the smart art graphic. I'll go back. I'll just choose the moderate effect here as well. So that is how we insert and modify\nsmart art. Go ahead and create your own\nsmart art graphic and come right back. In our last lesson,\nwe saw how we can create an infographic from existing content. Let's\ngo ahead and move on to the next slide. And this time we'll go ahead and insert\nsmart art and then add our content. Now I can click on smart Art right here\ninside of my content placeholder that will insert my smart art for me. I can also click on the insert tab. And the illustrations command group. Here's the smart art here as well. I'll go ahead and click on the insert\na smart Art graphic right from my content placeholder. And again, here's the entire library\nof what we can go ahead and insert. I want to express something as a process. So lots of different processes here\nthat I can. I can use we can integrate pictures\nin there as well. We'll get to pictures in\njust a little bit. Let's go ahead and keep it simple. I'll go ahead and insert\na step up process. I'll go ahead and press okay. So here's the shell of our smart art. Again\nwe have the smart Art contextual tab. And over here\nwe have our little text pane. Now what I can do\nI can either type the information in here or I already have the information I want. I'll go back to my other slide. I'll open up the text pane for this\nsmart art graphic, and I'll just copy and paste this list\nright into here. So if you ever already have an existing\nlist, you can simply copy and paste it in here. What I want to do first though, is\npress Ctrl A inside of my text pane. Here and delete everything first,\nbecause if I paste it in, it's going to just append that to the existing smart art. So I'll go ahead and right click. I'll go ahead\nand use the destination theme. And there is my smart art graphic. So all my levels are intact here as well. So that looks pretty good. But what if I want to go ahead and change\nthe smart art graphic to something else? I'll go ahead and click on the smart\nArt design tab here. And right over here under layouts. I'll get some similar layouts\nthat I can choose from. So I'll go ahead\nand maybe choose this first one here. Here's the step down process. That's what that would look like. Here's the accent process\nthat looks pretty good as well. And here's the picture accent process. So this actually incorporates pictures. I'll go ahead and click on this one. And so now we're given another shape with a picture placeholder. So I'm going to go ahead\nand take it a step further. I'll use three images that kind of communicate defining the project identifying and tasks here as well. So to do that I'll go ahead and click\non the placeholder either here or on my text pane here. It doesn't matter. I'll go ahead and click here. And I can either insert in a picture\nor I can use an icon. I prefer to use an icon\nbecause they're always the same size one inch by one inch pictures. We may need to crop the pictures to make\nthem fit inside of our smartart graphic. So I'll go ahead and grab an icon here. Here's my icon library. So I want something to represent\ndefining or yes, defining the project. So I'll search for let's say target. There we go. Like this graphic\nI'll go ahead and choose this one. I'll choose the fill colored\none as opposed to the outline. So I'll go ahead and choose this here. Here's my graphic behind it. For the next one, I'll look for a search icon. Search or find. And because we want to go ahead\nand identify the stakeholders. So maybe I'll. Maybe I'll use this one. A little hard to see it. Maybe I'll change that. And the last one\nshould be pretty simple to find. I'll just type tasks and I'll get a couple of task\nlists here as well. I'll go for it. I'll go for this one. That looks okay. Go ahead. Insert that. So here my three icons think I'm going to go ahead\nand change my second icon here. Here we go I want to first select it. Now I can right click on it. And I can change the graphic from icons. And I'll type find. Probably going to have the same issue. Let's see. Look for community. Here we go. Maybe I'll go with this one. Identify stakeholders. And there we go. So that's how we can change\nthe smart art graphic to another layout. And this is how we can integrate pictures\nin here as well. Now I want to make\nthis look a little nicer. So I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll give it a colorful but colorful palette. Here. There we go. So that looks pretty nice. Now I can, if I wanted to. I can make changes to the individual\nobjects here. So the arrow, all these\nI can go ahead and change. So if I wanted to go ahead\nand change the color of this icon, notice that we have the graphics format tab here that's available. If I wanted to do that\nI can simply go ahead and recolor it by applying a style or giving it a different different\ngraphic fill color. If I wanted to here,\nI wanted a standard color. I can go ahead and do that as well. So that's what we can do. So we can change the color. We can have smart art just kind of update the colors for us. I'll go ahead and give this a\nI'll give this a white outline. That looks pretty nice. And now the beauty of this is once I have my smart art,\nif I want to go ahead and change, I can. So if I wanted to change this\ngraphic, it's a matter of just hovering over the different ones\nand see which one I like. Here. That looks pretty nice as well. Sometimes the when you add a picture and you change the smartart, any type of arrows will will show up\nin the form of that picture. It's not really happening here, but so pretty nice. Let's see. Are there any other picture ones here? There's another picture. So this is a ascending picture process. So there we go. Now if I wanted to\nI can go ahead and just click on more layouts. This looks pretty nice. This gear icon here as well. I'll go ahead and click on more layouts. And I'll look for some of the other\nSmartart graphics that are available in the picture. Command group. And I'll take a look at those. So here is the another type here. I don't really like that. Not all of these will work because again,\nsome of them have their own type of requirements\nand they only allow a certain amount of levels. So it's just a matter of once\nyou incorporate those pictures, choose\nthe layout that you like and we're good to go. I'll go ahead and stick with this one. And maybe I'll change the colors here as well. And there we go. So go ahead and insert your smart art. Go ahead and insert some icons\nor even some images. See what they look like and come\nright back. Welcome to module four. For module four we'll go ahead and explore working with media and animations. Video. Collaborating on a presentation will customize our slideshow behavior. So what are some of the things\nthat we can kind of establish before we run our slideshow? And then we'll wrap up by using some of the newer tools\nto automate a slideshow. Go ahead and open up the module\nfor practice file and come right back. We'll dive right into module four. Here's my module for practice file. I'll jump into slide number two,\nwhich is lesson five. So for lesson five. It's all about working with media. We'll go ahead and insert\na local video file. And then we'll insert an online video\nhere as well. To insert media\nwe want to get to this media command group\nthat can be found on the insert tab. And over here we can insert videos from our device from the stock library. Also online videos. We'll take a look at the different sources\nthat we're able to stream videos from. When it comes to audio. You can either record your own audio\nusing a microphone, or you can go ahead and upload\na audio file from your computer as well. And we also have the screen\nrecording tool, which we'll take a look at\njust a little bit here. I want to take advantage\nof the content placeholder here, and I'll insert my video by clicking on\nthe Insert Video Content placeholder. So this allows me to basically upload a video from my computer locally. So I'll go ahead\nand insert this video here. And here is my video. Now once we insert the video\nwe can resize it. It's an object to cycle of the other\nobjects that we've been interacting with. So as expected we have a contextual tab. We actually have two. One is for video format\nand one is for playback. Well if I click on video format\nI can do things like, you know, choose a quick style. I can place it in an oval if I want to, or maybe give it a nice reflection, a simple shadow,\nor just a simple frame here as well. So I can do any of those things. Well,\nI want to go ahead and just run this slide and let's\nsee what this actually looks like. So I'll go ahead\nand I'll run this in reading mode. And I'll go ahead and play my video. So as we can see\nI can have some basic controls here such as I can play it,\nI can skim through it. And I can also adjust\nthe volume here as well. So this is kind of the default\nout of the box. Let's go ahead and make some formatting\nchanges to here as well. Press escape. Come back here. So if I click on here\nmaybe the first thing I'll do. I'll click on video format. I'll go ahead and put this in a frame. Maybe I'll put it in a go for this. Rounded rectangle here. So I'll put it in that frame. I can make it bigger if I want to as well. So I've placed it in a frame. And over here I can go ahead and play it to get a nice preview\nof what it would look like. Just like with our image tools,\nI can go ahead and give it some corrections, make it brighter,\nor have more contrast as well. I can even recolor it if I want to. And we have some other\npretty nice tools here as well. But that's about it for the video format. I just want to give it a quick style. I'll go to the playback here. And when we click on the playback context or tab, we can see that\nwe have some editing tools here that we can use such as trimming the video, fading in and out. And then we have some other video options here. This will basically establish\nhow the video behaves once we get to this slide. Let's take a look at the trim\nvideo feature. I'll click on Trim video. And in this particular video there was\na lot of whitespace in the beginning. So maybe I don't want to start. Maybe I want to start. Let me write about here. I'll start with that question. What brought you to learn it today? So maybe you're right about there, right. So just by moving that slider, I'm\nstarting at 14.9 seconds here as well. At the end I had a little\nsome more space in here as well. Maybe I'll stop right here\nas soon as the learned logo appears. That's it. I can even use these little arrows\nto kind of determine the starting point. That helps a little better. I'll go ahead and press. Okay. And let's preview it. There you go. So it started with the question as opposed to starting\nfrom the very beginning there as well. All right. So I already trim the video. I'll go ahead and establish the volume. I'll make sure that the volume is medium. I don't want it to be high\nfor my audience. And I want it to play automatically. So whenever I navigate to the slide,\nthis will play automatically here as well. And I want to play it in full screen mode. So I can go ahead and do that. And I'm good to go. So let's go ahead and run this and reading view. Let's see what this looks like. That's what my other half. So there you go. So we can see that\nthe volume has been set to medium. And it's playing in full screen here. And also played automatically. So I'll go ahead and escape and go back to my slide here as well. So go ahead and insert a video. Hopefully you have one.\nGo ahead and insert it. Take a look at the different tools\nunder the Video Format tab. And go ahead and trim the video. Make it start automatically. And also go ahead and play it\nfull screen and come right back. And this segment will go ahead and insert\nonline video. Now I'm actually\ngoing to insert a new slide. So I'll just press control\nM and start a new slide. And I'll change this layout to title only because I want to insert a nice big online\nvideo here from our YouTube site. So this will be an online video. So to insert an online video, if I click\non the insert tab and here is video. So I have the option to insert video from the online stock videos. Or I can grab from various sources\nhere as well. I'll click on online videos\nand what kind of just preview what's available in the stock\nvideo library. I'll click on online videos here. And we're giving some information. So these are the different sources\nthat we can stream video from. So YouTube SlideShare Vimeo\nstream and flip. So we basically need to grab the address or the URL of that video\nand paste it in here. Once we paste it in here\nwe'll get a nice preview of the video. Just ensuring\nthat we have the correct one. So I'm going to go ahead and jump over to our YouTube page\nwith the video that I want to stream here. There we go. So this is the video. I'll go ahead and play this here\ntraining exercise files for today. Okay. So to grab the video address\nI can just right click here and I'll copy the video URL. Once that's on my clipboard here I'll head back over to my PowerPoint. So right here\nI'll go ahead and paste the video so I can you can right\nclick and paste the video in there. Or you can press Ctrl V and we can see it shows up here. So here's my little tutorial on Microsoft\n365 basics. We can preview the video right here. Welcome to learn. And there we go. So even though it's an hour and 26 minutes\nlong we're streaming it. So as long as you have an internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. This is not being stored\nin our PowerPoint, so it's not taking up space, as is the video\nthat we uploaded from our computer. I'll go ahead and click on insert. And here is my video. So I can either have it\ntake up the entire slide like that. Or I can go ahead and resize it. If I click on the video format,\nI can still do things like I can. Correct it. I can recolor it. If I want to, I can even go ahead\nand place it in a frame. So maybe I want to place it in a frame\nlike this. I can do that. Or simple frame. Now if I click on the playback tab here, notice that these options over here,\nthey're grayed out. So none of the editing controls\nanything I can do really is to just decide whether I want this\nto play in sequence. Me meaning I have to click on it, or if I wanted to play it\nautomatically here as well. I'll go ahead and choose automatically. So we don't have all the tools\nbecause we don't really know. This is this video is being streamed. We don't own the video, so we cannot edit\nit here as well. I'll go ahead and click on my reading view\nhere and let's see what this looks like. Welcome to learn the training exercise files for today's. There we go. So we can kind of fast forward these here right. So depending on your internet connection\nyou should be good to go. All right\nI'll go ahead and press escape here. I'll press escape again to go back to my slide. So that is how we insert an online video\nfrom those different sources as well. Again we can play it. It works well right from the stream. We just don't have all of the normal bells\nand whistles that we have. If we actually own the video. I'm going to go ahead and delete this. I'll just press the delete key\nto get rid of it. And let's just take a look at the\nthe stock of online video. I'll click on the insert tab. I'll go back over to video. And let's take a look\nat some of the stock videos. Here. So these are not really long videos. They're pretty short. Maybe in the range of 9 to 15 seconds. And let's see I'll go ahead and grab this one here\nI'll go ahead and insert this. So it took up the entire slide. But again you can always resize it. We can just like what\nthere are other objects. We can resize them. I'm okay with it\ntaking up the entire slide though. That's perfectly fine. So I can go ahead and play it here. And this is going to be about nine\nseconds. Just a little over\nnine seconds here as well. So if I were to preview this for go on reading mode. So there you go. Pretty cool. I'll press the escape key and let's see what options\nwe have available. So this is from the stock. So we can still do the same things\nwith the video format. We can place it in a frame if we want to. Maybe I'll put it in a frame like that. We have the corrections\nthat we can use as well. And as far as playback,\nbecause this is from the stock, we do have the capability\nto trim the video. So we can actually trim the video\nif we want to. We can specify when it starts,\nwhen it ends. We can also opt to play it full screen. So all of the other options that we have there are pretty much good to go here\nas well. Right now one of the things is the\nwe have what's called a poster frame. And this allows us to basically\nput a poster on the first\nfirst glance at the video here. So if I wanted to maybe show this part, I can go ahead and click on Poster frame and I'll say this will be the starting frame for my actual video here. You can also go ahead and insert an image. So if you wanted to insert\nan image from file, that's basically what you'll see\nbefore you actually play the video. So if I click play here. There we go. So that's what it's all about. Inserting videos\ninto your PowerPoint presentation. Either the stock library online sources or a video locally from your device. The screen recording is a really nice tool in PowerPoint. Many of us are not aware\nthat we can actually record our screen. No need to buy an expensive program. We have one built in right here. After we recorded our screen,\nit will insert the recording right onto our slide for us here as well. So if I click on screen recording\nis going to minimize my PowerPoint window. Whatever is in the background\nwill be brought to the front here as well. I'll click on Screen recording. Let's take a look at the what's available. So as you\ncan see when we're recording the screen, we can select the area of our screen\nthat we want to record. Mine is already pre-selected. If you want to record your audio\nyour voice or your microphone,\nyou can go ahead and turn on the audio. And if you want to record\nyour mouse pointer, you can go ahead and record that as well. I'll record my audio. I'll record my pointer here as well. And I'll go ahead and select my area. But first what I want to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and just kind of resize my. My window here for Microsoft Edge. And I'm going to bring it down. One of the things that happens\nwith the screen recorder, this little toolbar here gets in the way\nsometimes when you're recording. So I want to make sure that my recording area is below that box. So I'll go ahead and reselect my area. I'll just draw a box around my Microsoft Edge window here. Like that. And there we go. So what you can do if you want to record\nyour entire screen, when you want to stop or pause your recording,\nyou can use the shortcut key. So windows logo shift plus Q\nthat will stop the recording for you. This way you don't have to go back\nto the top of your screen. Expose\nthis little toolbar here and click on Stop Recording because that will show up\non your recording at least the last time I did it, that's\nwhat happened. I'll go ahead and click on record. I'll get a countdown. I'll get a quick reminder of what\nthe shortcut is to stop the recording. Let's go ahead and do that. So in this case, I'll just demonstrate\nhow to sign up for a course at learn App.com. Let's get started\non how to sign up for a course app. Learn App.com. Let's first go to.learning.com. Once we're here, we can either go ahead\nand sign in or register. Or if you want to go ahead and view\nall classes, we can click here. Once we're here,\nwe can search for any class of interest. Or we can scroll down to see our upcoming\ncourses here as well. Here's an Excel Introduction course. I'll go ahead and click on here. So it gives me the details\nwhat will be covered. And it also shows the upcoming schedule\nfor these classes as well. Maybe I'll go ahead and take a little break and then February\nI want to go ahead and take this course. So I'll click on my little\nplus icon here to add this to the cart, and I'll remove the other one. I'll go to check out. And from here I simply just need to go ahead\nand click on the next step and continue the login registration payment\nand confirmation process. And I am good to go. And that's all to it. So there we go. I was able to do a just a small recording\nthere about a minute and 15 seconds. You can see it inserts the recording\nfor us right here onto the slide. Again we can resize this if we want to. Doesn't necessarily\nhave to take up the entire screen. What I'll do is\nI'll just go ahead and center it. Kind of align things a little better here on the slide. There we go. And so we can go ahead and play it. And as we can see\nof course my voice records my. Let's first go to my cursor as well dot learn it.com. So really really nice tool. Now because we inserted this screen\nrecording we have all of the tools\nall of the editing tools. Right. So if we wanted to trim\nthe video we can kind of preview it right. Make sure everything looks good. If it doesn't we can always go ahead\nand just trim different parts of the video here as well. We have all of the other tools\nthat we can go ahead and use. As we mentioned before,\nif you have offline captions, you can go ahead and insert captions\nfor the for the the video as well. So it's a really nice tool,\na really nice tool to use as a learning or as a help aid. Right. So a really nice option here as well. Go ahead and take advantage of the screen\nrecording tool. Go ahead and upload 1 or 2. The good thing is once we're done\nwe can go ahead and save this. So if you make any changes to it on the playback tab we can click on\nSave Media as you can do the same thing by right clicking on the video\nand clicking on Save Media. As we can save as a media file, or we can\neven save it as a picture here as well. So we can save it as a picture. We can save the media as a media file. So pretty cool. Go ahead and play around with the screen\nrecording tool and come right back. Welcome back. And let's\ngo ahead and move on to lesson number six. So we'll talk about collaborating\non a PowerPoint presentation here. So there's a couple of things\nthat we need to do. We first need to go ahead\nand save our presentation to OneDrive. And after we do that we can go ahead and share the presentation. And once once we have uploaded it to either\nOneDrive or SharePoint we can share it. We can go ahead and view different\nversions of the file here as well. So you can either click on the file\ntab and click on Save As. Go ahead and save it\nto one of your OneDrive spaces. Or if you have the share icon here, click on Share. It's going to first\nask you to go ahead and upload it to your OneDrive,\nand then you can share it. I'll go ahead and save it,\nand then I'll come back once I have that saved. Now that I have it saved, what I can do\nis click on the share icon here. So I'll go ahead and click on share and we get to this dialog box. Now this dialog box has had some changes recently. Looks a little different\nbut this is the modern version of it here. So what I can do is\nI first need to decide, well, who do I want to share this document with? How do I want to share it and what\ntype of access do I want them to have? Right? So I can either copy a link and send that link out\nvia email or by teams chat or any other medium\nand anyone that has that link. They can either edit\nor they can view the particular file here. Well, this is collaboration. I want to go ahead and send it to Adele was on my sandbox account,\nso I'll go ahead and type in Adele here. I'll make sure that Adele\ncan edit to make changes. And I'll just say please edit. And that's pretty much it. Once I go ahead and press send,\nI'm good to go. If I want more advanced options,\nI can go ahead and click on the sharing settings here. And I'll have some other options. But I have everything I need\njust on this very first window here. I'm sending this via outlook to Adele Edit Access, and I'm\ngoing to go ahead and send it here. Right. So I'll go ahead and close this out. Let's head on over to Adele's mailbox. See if we get that message here. I'll go ahead and refresh. Here it is. So just came in. This is what the message looks like. A file has been shared with you. Here's the custom message. I'll go ahead and click on open here. And this will open up online. Now my recipient will have the option\nif they want to open in the desktop app. They can do that as well. But to keep it simple\nwe'll just open the file here in the web. And here we go. So here is the here's Adele's\nversion of the file. And Adele\ncan see that I'm working in here. My avatar appears here\nbecause I'm currently in the file and I'm working on it. If I scroll down, we can see exactly. I'm currently on this slide\nfor lesson six. Well, that's where we need to go. So I'll go ahead\nand here and I'll add a task. So I'll say task two. And the owner here will be Adele. And I'll say that this has not yet\nstarted. And progress is 0%. So let's see what that looks like. I'll go back to my desktop copy here. Now you can see the changes\nhave already been made. I can see that Adele is showing up\nas a guest contributor. And I can see Adele is right here on slide number five. Right. So I'll go ahead and put myself in here. Now we can keep on editing here as well. So task three is going to be nester. Now what I can do if I click on the review tab\nI can add comments in here. Right. So maybe I want to add a comment\nregarding task number three. I'll go ahead and put a\ncomment in here and I'll say please confirm with Master. So this is the whole concept behind\ncollaborating. You can comment in here. We can work on the file together\nand we're good to go. Let's go back to the and let's see here. Let's click on the review tab. And let's click on Show comments. All right so here here are the comments here as well\nthat we can see. So that's pretty cool. So we can go ahead and make some changes\nI'll go ahead and reply to this. And I'll say I will take care of that. Go ahead and post the reply here as well. And so there we go. So it's a matter of saving to OneDrive\nand or SharePoint, sharing the document with edit Access and being able to mark up the document\nat the same time here as well. I can even see the notes that are in here. Let's go ahead and take a look\nat the different versions of the document. I'll go back to. Here. I'll click on the file tab and I'll click on info. And now what I can see is the version\nhistory. It's on the info tab. Here is the version\nhistory of the document. Now let's see what versions\nhave been captured so far. I'll click here. And so far\nsince I uploaded it and saved it, I can see that\nthree versions have been saved. Here's the version as of 1105 1109, and 1111 as well, right? So what I can do is\nI can go ahead and open a older version here. Let's see what this one looks like. So right now we have three tasks. So this kind of opens up the. That version. So we can see\nthe current version has three tasks. This version only has two tasks in here. So this is pretty helpful\nbecause sometimes some changes are made that are just too drastic. And you want to be able to fall\nback to a prior version. And so the fact that the versions\nare being saved automatically is a really,\nreally big help here as well. If I wanted to restore this version,\nI can click on restore. This would make this\nthe current version here as well. But I don't want to do that. I just want to go back to the\nto the other version here. So I'll go ahead and close this out. And it brings me back to my updated\nversion. I'll go ahead and close this pane here. And I am good to go. Now what I can do is let's see if I go over to the file tab, click back on info. And I click on protect here. So what I can do\nis I can mark this as final. But everyone will need to be logged out\nfirst. So I can let all of my collaborators\nknow that there's no more changes being made to this document,\nor marking it as final here as well. Right now, while we here is good to take a look at these things,\nwe can see the on the info tab here. We have the media size and performance. We can see that we have 68 megs here. The entire presentation is currently 71\nmegs, mostly because of the screen recording and that video that\nwe uploaded earlier as well. I'll go back here. And so\nthat's how you collaborate on a document. For less than seven. We'll talk about customizing\nslideshow behavior. So what we'll discuss\nis some of the things that we can do before we run our slideshow, and some things that we can do\nduring our slideshow as well. So sometimes you may notice\nwhen you're running your slideshow, your presenter window is either turned off\nor turned on, or it's showing up on the wrong monitor. Well, those are things that we can use to\nset up a slideshow to set up a slideshow. Let's click on the slideshow tab here. And we have an entire section here\ndevoted to setup. Now we can go ahead and click on Setup\nSlideshow. And it's going to be a combination\nof all of these different things here. Using time and timings. Using the presenter view. Things like that here as well. Let's click on Setup Slideshow. And when presented\nwith this dialog box here and there's a couple of different areas. So how do we want to run the presentation. By default when you run the presentation\nit takes up the entire screen. But if you want it to kind of\nhave it run in reading mode, you can choose the second option, right? It just runs on the window. That way\nit doesn't take up your entire screen. You can resize it. And then if you wanted to\njust kind of loop on maybe a big TV, you can go ahead\nand use the browse at a kiosk. So it's full screen. You'll notice\nif you when you check that option it's automatically going to loop until you stop the slideshow. Right. So you may walk into a building\nat a corporation. You may see the same slideshow\nor running over and over and over again. It's in kiosk mode, right? I'll go back to presented by a speaker\nfull screen. And then over here for show slides you can\ndetermine which slides you want to show. You can leave it just for all. Or we can say\nI only want to show slides 1 to 5. We can do that\nor show everything here as well. We don't have any custom shows in here. We'll talk about that\nin just a little bit. If we create some custom shows, we\ncan choose to run the custom show as well. So these things just kind of gives\nyou some, some confidence\nas you're running your slideshow, because maybe you don't want certain slides to show up\non this particular presentation. Now, in terms of of advancing\nslides, right now by default is going to use timings\nif any timings are present. So you can either adjust the timing\nfor each slide. But we're going to go ahead\nand record the entire presentation. So there's really\nno need to rehearse the timings down here\nif you're using multiple monitors. You want to make a choice. Do you want to use presenter view? Presenter view\nis a really nice thing to use because while your audience\nis seeing your presentation, you are taking a look\nat your presenter view so you can see what's coming next, either\na slide or an animation. You also have notes that you can use\nas talking points as well. So I'm going to go ahead and use\nPresenter view. And my slide show is going to run on my primary monitor. I'll leave that as is for now. I'll go ahead and press okay. And I'll go ahead and run my slide\nshow here. So here we can see\nmy slide show is running. I'll go ahead\nand switch the presenter view so that it's showing on this monitor. And let's take a look at the presenter\nview. I'll press escape. I'll go back in to set up slide show. And I want my slide show\nto run on my internal display. I'll press okay. Now I'll run my presentation. So on my other screen\nI have the slide show. But here's the presenter view. And as you can see it's pretty nice\nbecause we have any notes that we have in here. We can see what's coming up next. So this is our next slide. Lesson number eight. And right here I can just kind of navigate\nthrough my slides. If I have any animations\nI can see what's coming up next as well. And so pretty nice. What I can also do\nif I want to jump to a slide, I can open up\nmy see all slides pane right here. Now my audience will not see this on the\nI can see this. They're still seeing the current slide. So if I wanted to navigate to\nthis slide, if I click on it now that is being displayed on my audience screen here as well. Some other things I can do. I can go ahead and turn on the pan\nand laser pointer tools. So I can go ahead and just kind of use\nthose here as well. We'll talk about these\nin just a little bit. And if I wanted to go ahead and toggle my camera\nI can go ahead and turn on my camera. I can turn on the subtitles right here. So a lot of things we can do\nright from the presenter window. So if I toggle the subtitles now, it's going to be writing whatever I'm saying here. I'll go ahead and turn that off. And we have some other tools here as well. If you wanted to hide the presenter view\nyou can go ahead and do that. But we're good to go. I'll go ahead\nand end the slideshow from here. And those are just some of the basics when it comes to setting up a slideshow. I'll go back down to lesson number seven\nhere. And let's\ngo ahead and create a custom slideshow. So over here on the slideshow tab we have the custom show in the start Slideshow command group. Right. If I click on this drop down here\nI don't have any custom shows. I'll go ahead and click here. So I want to create a new custom show. Well why would you want to create\na custom show? Maybe you just have one really long,\nyou know, slide deck. You may have 30 slides, but maybe you divide that slide, that slide deck\ninto three different sections, like so. Instead of showing all 30 slides, you\nmaybe you just want to show the first ten. So I can do is click on new and I'll just call this lesson five. So I want my. Title slide. Here's lesson five. So here are the three slides that make up lesson five I'll go ahead and add those. And now I can reorder them\nif I want to move them up and down. But I'll go ahead and press okay. Now I can see\nI have less than five in here. If I go ahead and click on show,\nit's only going to show those slides. So here's my presenter view. As you can see, it's only showing those four slides\nthat make up that particular show. And we're good to go. So that is a custom show right. Now keep in mind\nwhen we setting up the slideshow we can also say\nwell let's just go ahead and run that. Lesson five custom slideshow here as well. So pretty good. Okay. Let's go ahead and stop here. I want you to be able to practice. Go ahead and just set up your slideshow. Go ahead and practice. Make sure that your presenter view\nis turned on. It's showing on there\non the screen of your choice. And go ahead and take a look\nat some of the different tools here. We'll come back\nand we'll go ahead and take a look at some of the annotating tools\nthat are available. While we are presenting. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and set up navigation\nfor our slide show. Now remember when you were presenting. If you right click you can pretty much go to a slide of your choice\nif you want to. Once we have the presenter view turned on, we can kind of jump around,\nbut it would be nice to kind of give our audience. Really\nnice feature called the zoom feature. Okay, so what the zoom feature is and I'm actually\ngoing to insert a slide here. So right up to my title slide and this will be\nI'll just call this my landing slide. And what I'm going to do\nI'll just quickly insert some links to my different lessons here. So to do that I'll go ahead and press Ctrl K on my keyboard. Okay. So this will insert a hyperlink right. So just like in the other office documents\nExcel and Word, we can link to a place in the document. So instead of linking to an existing file a web page\nI'll click on place in this document. And now what I can do\nis I can link to different slides. So I want to be able to link first to lesson five. And for the text it says lesson five. Working with media. That's perfectly fine. I'll go ahead and leave that as is. And just like that we have a hyperlink. I'll go ahead and press enter. I'll repeat the process\nfor six, seven and eight. So I'll press Ctrl k. To a place in the document\nI want to go to lesson six. I'll accept the text. I'll press okay. I'll do that two more times. Ctrl K this time. Lesson seven. And I'll go ahead and press okay. One more time. Ctrl k and this will be for lesson eight. Right. So I have a nice little landing\nslide here. So basically if I go to\nif I run this in reading mode, what I can do is I can click on this link\nwhile I'm presenting. And this will take me\nto that particular slide. Now it would be nice\nif we can go back to that landing slide. I have a little button\nthat we can click on. So we can always go back right. I want to be able to get back to\nthis slide by just clicking on a button. So we have what's called a zoom feature. I'll check this out. Look what I'm going to do here. I'll go to lesson five. And from lesson five I want to be able to go back to the landing slide. I'm going to drag my landing slide. I'm just going to click and drag it. I can drag it right onto my slide here. Maybe I'll put it right. Right here. Okay. And then I'll move this other icon\nout of the way. I'll put this down here somewhere. Right. So you're saying, well,\nwhat just happened? What did you just do? I'm just going to position\nthis up here at the top. So this is called a zoom feature. So now I have a link to a slide\nin another slide. Let's go into reading mode\nand let's see how this works. Here we go. So I'm here on this particular slide. And now if I want to go back\nto my landing slide if I click here. So it zooms in to that slide for me. And now what I can do is I can go ahead\nand jump to another lesson here as well. Right. If I press the back key\nit goes back to lesson five. Or I can just go ahead and click back here and jump back to lesson five as well. So that is the zoom feature as well. Now what I can do if I wanted to\nI can go ahead and change this. So right now\nthis is just a picture of my slide. If I click on here I'll notice that I zoom tab appears here as well. So maybe what I'll do is I'll go ahead\nand change this image to something else. And maybe I'll grab an icon. And maybe I'll look for an home icon. Maybe I'll use this one. So I've converted this to a home icon\nand I can resize it. I can even put it out of style to\nif I want to. I'll keep it simple. I'll just put it here on the top\nright of my slide. There you go. So that's my zoom feature. Now what I can do I can actually copy this and I can paste it on lesson six. I just need to move this out of the way. So I'll go ahead and paste\nthis here on lesson six. And I just copied and pasted it. Well let's see if this still works. I'll go ahead and run this slide\nin reading mode. If I click on it it brings me to my landing slide. I'll go back to lesson six and I'm good to go. So that's the zoom feature right. So go ahead and create your first zoom. Go ahead\nand change it to an icon of your choice. Again to do that just click on the zoom. Click on the zoom tab\nand you can change the image here as well. Go ahead and add that home button\nto each of your lesson slides. Now we'll be able to navigate\nback and forth as we are presenting. Now that we've added some navigation and we've set up some of the basics,\nit's time to go ahead and present and take a look at some of the tools\nthat are available. We'll already discuss the presenter view. So now we can do. Let's take a look\nat how we can annotate a presentation. How we can enable these subtitles as well. Now we can accomplish these as well\nthrough the presenter view. I'm going to go back to my slide show. Let's just make sure\nthat I'll turn off my presenter view. I don't want my slideshow to run on this\nscreen, so everything is good to go. I want to make sure\nall of my slides are selected. And from here, if I want to, I can go\nahead and choose my laser pointer color. I will be using the laser pointer. I'll be using the pen as well. So I can actually select my color\nahead of time. I'll leave them both on red. I'll go ahead and press okay. You can press F5 to start your slideshow. So here's my slideshow. I'll go ahead and head on over\nto my next slide here just by clicking. And so here's my landing slide. I'll just go to lesson five here. And here's lesson five. Now on the bottom\nwe have some kind of grayed out tools. So we can go to the last slide. We can go to the next slide. Here are the pen tools down here. So if I click here\nI can either choose my laser pointer. Right. So I can go ahead\nand just kind of point on my screen. If I go back down here. I can change that to the pen. And the pen basically allows us to just kind of mark things up. I can do things like that terrible arrow. Right. So we can do that. If I want to go back, I'll just uncheck the pen. I have my pointer back here. Now I can go ahead and either\nplay my video or go to the next slide. I'll go to my next slide here as well. And what else do I have here. Here's the highlighter. So if I wanted to highlight\nsomething turn on my highlighter. Go ahead and highlight it here. And of course we can change the color. So we can change the color\nfor all of the ink down here as well. So for my highlighter if I wanted\ninstead of yellow maybe I want orange. Here's my orange highlighter here as well\nthat I can use right. Now let's go ahead\nand I'll get my pointer back here. So I'll unselect my highlighter. If I move over to the right here's\nthe slide sorter. And here are the subtitles. So I can go ahead and turn those on. And this is what my screen now looks like. This is very helpful. And we're good to go. Great. Turn on my video if I want to. And then here are some other tools. So if I wanted to transition\nto a custom show I can even though I'm not running\nPresenter view right now, I can still go ahead\nand turn that on here as well. And for the subtitle settings, I can either show them on the top\nor it's overlaid on my presentation or I can change the location of it\nas well. Right. Maybe I'll put it up above the slide,\nthe top like that. So we have different options\nthat we can use here. Now if you didn't mark up your slide\nwe do have an eraser here as well. So you can erase them individually\nor you can choose to go ahead and erase\nall of the ink on a slide. Right. Now keep in mind when you are marking up\nyour slide here. All the ink will remain\nunless you remove it. So if I were to close my presentation here and go back to this slide, this arrow\nand this somewhat of a circle will show up as our shapes here as well. So you want to make sure it will ask you\nanyway before you close the presentation. Do you want to remove all the ink as well? But while we're here,\nlet's test out our navigation. Great. I'll get my pointer back here and I'll jump to the. Let's jump to lesson number eight. And from lesson number eight\nwe can go back to that landing slide. And jump to lesson number five. So pretty cool. So we're zooming in\nand out of our landing slide. If you press the back key after you go to your landing slide, that goes back to the slide\nthat you were on before here as well. All right. I'll go ahead and end the show. I'll just go ahead\nand press the escape key. And it asks me right here,\ndo I want to keep my annotations? I do not. Because again,\nthey will appear as shapes on your slide. I'll go ahead and discard them. And I am good to go. Great. So a lot of the things\nthat we just accomplished. Annotating. Turning on the subtitles. We can use the presenter view\nfor that as well. And we'll see\nthose options are also available. So go ahead and run your slideshow. When we come back\nwe'll put it all together. We'll take a look\nat how we can record our slideshow so that it can run automatically. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nnumber eight. What we want to do here is we want to\ngo ahead and automate our slideshow. Right. So we don't want to sit and click through our slides\nas we're presenting. What we'd like to do\nis to kind of record our slideshow, and then we can\ngo ahead and play it back and run it so that all the slides will transition\nautomatically. So let's take a look\nand see how we can do that. Here. If I click on the slideshow tab. I have the record option here. So I can record from the beginning\nand notice what it says. So records narrations animations\ntransitions, ink and laser pointer gestures. So everything that I'm doing\nwill be recorded here as well. So we don't necessarily\nneed to rehearse timings because now we have the recording feature\nthat will record everything for us. So what I'm going to do I want my recorder\nwindow to show up on here. So I'll just change this here. And then I'll go ahead and press okay. Just so we can see what that looks like. I'll go back to the first slide\nand I'll click on record from the beginning. And this is going to open up my\nmy recording view here. Now before we do that I highly recommend that you use this\nfeature called rehearsal with coach. This is a really, really nice tool. Basically\nyou can practice with the eye coach and it's very,\nvery intuitive and very, very robust. It's going to be providing feedback to let you know if you're talking\ntoo fast, if your pace is too slow. If your voice is monotone,\nyou're speaking too loud, too soft. If you're using filler words\nso it gives you a really nice report, kind of coaches you along the way,\nit'll say, great job, keep it up. So I highly recommend\nyou use the rehearse with coach. It will allow you\nto go through your entire slide and you can practice with it\nthere as well. Once you've done\nthat, we'll go ahead and click on record where we can also record\na slideshow from the record tab. So here's the record from the beginning. Now there's a lot of things\nthat we can do in here. We'll just touch on a few of them. So here we can see here is the window for our recording. Once we're ready we just need to go ahead\nand click on the record button. Just a few things to note. If you wanted to turn on your camera,\nyou can. Your camera will appear. I'm down here on the bottom right. So your image will appear down here\non the bottom right as well. At the very top, when you have notes,\nwe have a little teleprompter here that will help you as you're\ngoing through your actual slides. Now this is one view down\nhere on the bottom right. There are different views. So right now\nthis is the teleprompter view. Let's click on this drop down. The other one is the presenter view. So the presenter view\nthis is the one that we're accustomed to. We can kind of see what's coming next either an animation or a next slide. And we can see what our audience\nseeing here as well. Right. Then we have other things down here. Laser pointer highlighter. They're all here for us as well. The other view is the slide view. So this is just your operating\njust with the slides. And you can go through it there as well. I'm going to go back to Teleprompter view and here we go. So if you want to record your microphone you can either turn it off\nor you can turn it on as well. If we click here for more options,\nyou can select the microphone that you want to use. You can select your camera. And if you're using cameo which is a newer\nfeature, you can use cameo as well. I'm just going to do a simple recording just so that we can see what\nthe finished product will look like here. So not going to spend too much time\non each slide. Here we go. Welcome to PowerPoint module four. My name is Mo Jones. Let's go ahead and learn together. Here's our landing slide. We have four lessons. Lesson number five. Lesson number six. Lesson number seven. And then finally. Lesson number eight. Automating a slideshow. Lesson\nfive is all about working with media. We can either insert local video\nor we can insert online video. Here's my video. I can go ahead and play this here. That's all my other. Once I'm done, I can go ahead and move on\nto my next slide. Here. I'll go ahead and turn on my where is my pen so I can go ahead and just draw some shapes in here\nif I want to. I'll go to my next slide. Here's my notes at the top so I can refer to that\nas I'm going through my slides here. So when we're inserting these screen recorder it's\na matter of getting to this particular icon here or this command group,\nthe media command group on the insert tab. Remember after you insert your screen recording\nto take a look at the playback options and the other formatting options as well. Lesson six is all about collaborating. As we can see,\nwe can go ahead and share a file grant editing access and we can go ahead\nand mark up the file together. We can see who's in the file\nwhere they're currently working on, and we can add comments to the file\nas well. Lesson number seven is all about\nsome of the other default settings that we can establish\nfor our presentation, as well. Don't forget about the zoom feature. We can always click on that button\nto go back to the slide of our choice. And then finally for lesson number eight, I highly recommend\nthat you record your presentation and use the rehearse\nwith Coach tool here as well. Now when we finish the slideshow, it tells us to click here to export our video. So I'll go ahead and click there\nand I can go ahead and export it to to the location of my choice here. I'll go ahead and click on browse. Typically you want to upload it\nto your OneDrive space. I'll just put it on my desktop here. I'll just call this copy and I'll go ahead and export\nthat as a MP4 video. And that's going to take\na little bit of time to record. Once it's finished, I'll come right back. So finally I get the message\nthat my video was exported successfully. So from here I can click here to view\nthe video and share with others as well. I'll go ahead and click here. And it's asking me. I do trust it. I'll go ahead and press yes. And just giving me some security messages here. I'll just go ahead and press\nokay to open the file opens up in my default media player. And here we go. Let's go ahead and go because I let it slide me up for lessons. Lesson five. So there we go. So we can see everything has been recorded as well. And we're good to go. I'll go ahead and close this out. And we're good to go. So that is how we record a slideshow. So notice now for each slide we'll see the actual voice note\nthat was left on each slide. So every slide\nhas a little recording here. So in the past\nwe would have to do these things kind of manually insert\nthe audio insert the timings as well. But now the recording\ntakes care of everything for us as well. So go ahead to record your your show. Go ahead and export it. Go ahead and play it.\nMake sure everything is okay. If you want to go ahead and share it. Feel free to do so as well. Now that we have recorded our slideshow,\nwe see that everything was recorded well,\nwe did have the option of exporting it to a media file,\nbut something else happened as well. So if I were to go ahead\nand just run my slideshow, it's going to run automatically. So the timings for each slide,\nthe voice duration on each slide, and any ink or markup\nthat I used will be played as well. So if I did not want to play the video,\nI just want to go ahead and run the slide. I'll go ahead and run it here on the PowerPoint module for\nI had a small child and we can see the voice\nnarration is included. We can see the slides are moving\nautomatically without my interaction. Plus the number six plus number seven. And finally lesson number eight okay. Now I can still jump in if I want to,\nbut for the most part everything is happening\nautomatically here as well. So I'll press escape and we're good to go. So you can either share that video\nor play the video or you can, you can just come in and actually just run your slideshow. And here's a little bit of ink that I left when I was kind of annotating my coffee\ncup here. So I'll just click on here\nand I'll just go ahead and delete that from my slide as well. If you go back to the record tab\nnow, you'll notice that some of these other options are available\nbecause we did perform a recording. We can do some other things like clear\nthe recording on the current slide, or we can clear the recording\nfrom all of the slides. Maybe we just want to go ahead and redo\nit, right. We can save it as a show. Right. So we can create a separate slide\nwith the P as x extension there as well. We can export it to video\nfrom here as well. We can learn more to see what's new,\nwhat else we can do here as well. We can also use the cameo feature as well with our camera feed. So that's the benefit of recording a show. We can automate it. And we still have the capability\nto kind of interact with the slides, even though it's automated here as well. Just to recap, we're able\nto customize the PowerPoint environment. We saw how we can create our own ribbon tab and add our own command groups\nand our own commands as well. Even add more commands\nto our Quick Access toolbar. We took a look at the slide master. We're able to customize design templates. We're able to save a design as a template, and then we're able to create\nsome infographic fix with smart art. We're able to work with media. We're able to collaborate\non a presentation after saving the presentation\nto a cloud space. We're able to customize slideshow\nbehavior, establishing some of the default settings\nfor our slideshow, and then we're able to automate\na slideshow as well. Remember\nto use the rehearse with Coach tool and then go ahead\nand record your slideshow. Congrats on completing the course and\nlook forward to seeing you in a future. Learn it! Course. Don't forget to like and subscribe! Hello and welcome to Microsoft PowerPoint\nadvanced. You're learning with Mo Jones, IT\nprofessional and educator for our advanced course\nwe have two modules. So module three and module four. For module three\nwe'll take a look at how we can customize the PowerPoint environment. We'll take a look\nat how we can customize design templates. It's all about the slide master. We'll save the design as a template. But we can either share or reuse\nover and over again. We'll also go ahead and take a look\nat creating infographics with smart art. No need to search the web\nfor infographics, we can make our own. There's\nan extensive library of capabilities right here inside of Microsoft PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and dive in. Please open up the PowerPoint module\nthree exercise file and come right back.

I currently have my model three\npractice file open here. And here we have a few slides. And here is lesson\none custom sizing the environment. So one of the things I will do is we'll\ngo ahead and create our own ribbon tab. And then we'll add our own commands to it. And then we'll also go ahead\nand set some global options. Just some useful options\nthat may help us as well. In particular, what I would like to do is\nadd some of these tools that will help me as I'm designing my presentation,\nsuch as the animation pane, the beloved eyedropper,\nthe selection pane that helps us to organize objects on a slide,\nand of course, the slide master. So to do that right now, in order to get to the eyedropper,\nI could add it to my Quick Access toolbar. That's one thing that I can do. Or I need to be interacting\nwith an object, and then I can go ahead and pull up\nthe eyedropper from there as well. Or if I don't feel like clicking\non the contextual tab, clicking on Shape\nFill, and clicking on the eyedropper. Well, let's\ngo ahead and add our own ribbon tab. We're going to right\nclick on any one of these tabs, and just click on the option\nthat says Customize the Ribbon. So I'll click on Customize the Ribbon. We get to this PowerPoint options dialog. And on the left we can see that\nwe can customize the ribbon. Here are all the commands. Well at least the popular commands. I'm going to change this to all commands, so I'll change this to all commands. Now I can see all the commands\nthat are in PowerPoint over here on the right. I can see that I have some,\nI can see the tabs that I have here. So for example, here's the home tab. And the home\ntab has the clipboard command group paragraph so forth and so on. Well I want to create my own. As you can see I do have a couple\nof pre-made ones here as well. So for example\nI created a tab called My Designs. And let's see what that looks like here. So when I created this tab it comes with a tab and then a command group. And then I have my commands down here as well. I going to turn this on. Let's see what this looks like here. And then we'll go ahead and recreate it. So if I enable that I'll go ahead and find it\nhere on my ribbon. Here it is my designs. So now if I click on my designs\nI can quickly access the animation pane. I can turn on the eyedropper right away and apply a particular color to that content placeholder there. If I want to. And I can also turn on the selection pane. Take a look at all\nthe different objects on my slide. I can also access the slide master\nright from here as well. So that's what we can do. So let's go ahead and create our own. Let's go back\nto customize the ribbon here. And to do that the first thing we need to do\nis click on the new tab option here. So we'll click on new tab. So here is our new tab right here has a generic name new tab. It has a generic command group. Let's go ahead and rename both of those. So for the new tab I'll click on rename. Maybe I'll call that design 24. Go ahead and press okay. And for the command group\nI'll rename that as well. I'll click on rename. You can also choose an icon if you want to go ahead\nand choose this here. And the displayed name\nis going to be called Design Tools. Go ahead and press okay. So I'm going to go have my design tab. Here's my command group. The next thing for me to do\nis to go ahead and actually add commands to that particular command group. So I want to make sure I have design tools\nselected here. And I'll change the commands\nfrom popular commands to all commands. So now what I can do is I can type\nthe letter E. This will bring me down to the E commands. I want to look for the eyedropper. Here\nit is. I'll add the eyedropper in there so we can see how this works. So here's level one, which is the actual tab, level two, which is the command group. And then we have level three\nwhich is the actual command. So let's go ahead and add some more. I'm going to go ahead\nand add the slide master. So I'll type the letter S\nand I'll look for the slide master here. And again you can pretty much add any any command that you want. I'll just click on Slide Master. I'll also turn on the selection pane. And here we go. I'll add that and I'll keep it\nsimple I'll just add one more. I'll go back to the group\nand I'll add the animation pane. And I'm good to go. Here are my four commands. I'll press okay. And I'll go ahead and locate design 24. Here it is right here. And from here I can go ahead. And I could even create\nanother command group name that add my own commands in here as well. I can keep going as well. So that's what we want to do. So go ahead and customize your ribbon. Go ahead and create a ribbon tab. Rename the command group. Go ahead and add some commands\nthere as well. And come right back. Now that we are able\nto create our own tab. So here are my two tabs here. The next thing we can do\nis turn on some useful options. I'll go back here. I'll right\nclick on any of these ribbon tabs and I'll go back to customizing\nthe ribbon. This brings me to the PowerPoint options\ndialog here. So I'll go back to the general here. And some of these\nare turned on by default. But I find these to be pretty helpful\nwhen you're designing your presentation. So the first tab here on the general tab I can see that\nI have some user interface options. Now if you're using two monitors,\nyou may notice that when you move your application\nfrom one window to the next, you may have\nsome appearance issues here as well. So you may want to go ahead and optimize for best appearance\nwhen you're using multiple displays. If you just kind of hover\nover the little information icon, it gives you some more information\nup here as well. All right. So you can toggle it back\nand forth, optimize for compatibility or optimize for best appearance. I like the mini toolbar on selection. This is pretty much\nwhenever you highlight a chunk of text. It gives you the mini tool that allows you\nto do some quick formatting. A big part of designing in PowerPoint\nis live preview. So for example, before we apply a\nparticular style or some type of feature, we can get a preview\njust by hovering the mouse over it. So I'd like to leave\nthat turned on there as well. For those\nof us who like to collapse the ribbon, remember we can always change the ribbon\ndisplay options. I like to see the full ribbon,\nso I'm good to go. You may want to collapse the Microsoft\nsearch box. As you can see, I do have it over here. It is currently minimized and this allows me a little more room\nif I'm using my Quick Access toolbar. I have some more room over here\nto work with as well. So I can do that if I want to. I'll scroll down a little bit. Here's the PowerPoint designer. So when you're designing\nyou're either using the A theme, you're using the slide master,\nor you're using the PowerPoint designer. I have it turned off right now\nbecause I'm going to be using the slide master to design my presentation as well. If we go down to the save and go down to the preserve fidelity\nwhen sharing this presentation, if you're using special fonts\nin your presentation, if you're a recipient does not have\nthat particular font or set of fonts,\nthey will not be displayed properly. So you may want to embed\nthe fonts in the file so that even though they don't have those fonts installed, they will\nstill be able to view them as well. So that's another nice option\nto be able to use. There. The other ones here. In terms of advanced when it comes to printing,\nwe can print true type fonts as graphics. So that's another nice option\nthere as well. And that we can use. And of course\nif we go to the Quick access toolbar here, just like how we can add any command\nto the the ribbon tab that we created. Here are the current commands\nthat are on my Quick Access toolbar. But I\ndo have access to the entire library. So if I change this to all commands,\nI can add any command to my quick access toolbar. And because I minimize\nthe search box here, I have a lot of room over here to be able\nto add some of those commands as well. So those are just some options\nthat may help you as you continue\nto create designs in PowerPoint. Let's move on to lesson\ntwo designing with the Slide Master. Now what is the slide master? Let's go ahead and take a look\nat the slide master to get there I need to go ahead and click on the view\ntab and get to the actual slide master. Once I'm there,\nI can do something like insert a layout. I can rename a layout and I can insert content placeholders\nas well. Let's do something simple in the slide\nmaster. Let's go ahead and make universal changes\nto our entire presentation. For example, we often do this for each slide. Maybe we want to go ahead\nand change the title. Maybe we want to go ahead and do something\nlike change the font. Now go for this one and change the color. And then go ahead and change the size. We go to our next slide. We do the same thing. Well we don't have to do that. Instead of going to every single slide\nand changing the formatting options for all of our title placeholders,\nwe can do that in the slide master. So go ahead and undo all those changes\nor press Ctrl Z a few times here. Now back to normal. Let's head on over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab. And once I'm on the view tab\nall the way to the far left, we'll see the slide master. Let's hover over the slide Master\nand see what it says. So Slide Master, it controls\nthe look of your entire presentation, including colors, fonts, backgrounds,\neffects, and just about everything else. So I can insert a shape or a logo and it will show up on all of my slides\nautomatically. Well, that sounds pretty good. Now go ahead and click on the slide\nmaster here. Now here we can notice\nthat we have a different view. Now we are in the slide master view. We can see that\nwe now have the slide master tab. And we have some command groups here\nthat are specific to our slide master. Now important to note on the left\nwe'll have different types of slides. What I want to do\nis scroll all the way to the top here. And you'll notice\nall the way at the very top, we'll notice that a slide\nis bigger than all of our other slides. So in fact,\nthis is the actual slide master. The other slides that we see here. These are the different layouts. So here's the title and content layout. Here's the two content layout. Here's the comparison layout. So that's what that is. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on the actual slide master here. And let's just get a good understanding\nof how this works. So whatever changes\nI've made to this slide it's going to affect all of my slides\nregardless of what type of layout it is. So I'm just going to do something simple. I'll go ahead and I want all of my title slides to be a particular font\ncolor and size. So I'll go ahead and highlight these. I'll go back to the home tab and I'll go ahead and apply\nthe formatting there. Once we apply the formatting\nwe'll close the slide master and take a look\nand see how our slides have been updated. Okay I'll change this font here. I'm going to go with the Georgia font. Right. So here's Georgia and I want it to be\nthat nice Georgia Blue. And I'll make it 40. And that's it. Now if you take a look you'll notice. Take a look at my different layouts. So here's the title slide. We can see that the title slide is already incorporating\nthat formatting that I just applied. Here's the title and content slide layout. We can see it's also incorporating that format that I've made to the slide\nmaster. Let's go back to the slide Master. Let's go ahead and close the master view. This will put our presentation\nback to the original or normal view. And let's take a look to see\nif our slides were updated. And we can see that they were. So here's my title slide. Here's slide number two. So all of my slides now have that universal\nformatting for my title. Let's take a step further. Let's go back into the slide master. And let's see what else we can do here. Again I want to make sure I click on that\nvery top slide here. And what I'm going to do\nis for all of my level I want to change my bullets actually. I want to highlight\nthese five bullet levels here. And I'll go to the home tab. And instead of having those regular bullets, maybe I want something\nlike hollow squares. So I'll go ahead and choose how squares. And for my level one item,\nmaybe I want that to be, let's say orange. My level two items on the list. Maybe I want that to be. I'll go with purple. That's it. Let's go ahead and analyze our slides and see if it incorporates\nthese formatting changes. I'll go back to the slide master. I'll click on Close Master View and look at that. All of my level\none bullet points are orange. And it has the hollow squares\nhere as well. If I go back to slide number two we can see all of those formatting changes\nhave been applied here. The title Georgia 40 blue level one orange with the squares level two bullet items or list items purple with the other square as well. So those are some of the universal changes\nthat we can make with the slide master. Now just one more thing to note. I'll go back into the slide master here. So I have two options. What I did initially is\nI chose the master slide. So this applies the formatting\nto every single slide. What if I only wanted to make some changes\nto my. Let's see if I hover over this one. So this is title and content. It's currently being used by slides\n2 to 3 and 5 to 7. So if I wanted to format\nonly this particular slide layout I can do that here as well. So for my third level here\nI'll go ahead and make this. let's see I'll make this green. Like that. It's only going to affect my title and content layout. So let's go back here. I'll close the master view. And so this is a let's see lesson one. This is a title and content. Let's add a third level item. And there you go. We can see that it's already. It's already green. If I go to a nother layout let's see. Do I have a two content layout in here. Well let's just insert a two content layout slide. Okay. So here's level one. Here's level two and here's level three. So we can see that level three item only applies\nto that particular type of slide. So we can either make universal changes\nto the entire presentation or to specific slides as well. Go ahead and make some simple changes\nin the slide master and preview it and come right back. Let's continue fun with the slide master. Well, what I want to do\nnow is create a custom slide layout. If I click on New Slide\nhere, here are the different layouts that are available\nbased on the current theme that I'm using. Now, I don't have the particular layout\nthat I'm looking for. Basically\nwhat I want is the three content layout. So I have title and content. I have two content. I want a slide that has three columns\nwhere I can easily express three concepts of three main keys\nor three main ideas here. So I don't have one. So what I can do is create my own layout. Let's go ahead and do that. I'll click on the view tab here\nand I'll click on the slide master. Now I have two options. I can either\njust kind of duplicate an existing slide and just make a basic update. Or I can insert a new layout. I'll keep it simple. I'll use it\nbased on the two content layout here. So in the slide master\nI'll click on the two content layout. So we have two content here. But I want three. So what I'm going to do\nis duplicate the slide and just resize these placeholders. And place one here in the middle. So I'm going to right\nclick on this layout. And I'll choose the duplicate layout option here. I can see it's duplicated. It's the exact replica of the one above. So on the duplicated layout\nI want to rename it first. So we'll duplicate it, rename it, and then we'll go ahead and format it. So I'll right click on it. I'll choose rename. I can also click right here to rename it. I'll right click I'll rename\nI'll call this one three content. I'll press rename. And I'm good to go. So now what I can do\nI can just go ahead and resize these. So I'll go ahead and grab the content\nplaceholder on the left here. And I'm just going to resize it. I do have the footers down here\nin the bottom, so I'll make sure it's the same width\nas my footers one on the right. I'll grab the resize handle\nand I'll snap it to that footer on the bottom right here. Now I have space in the middle\nto put a a bigger one. I can resize them,\nmake them all the same size if I want to, but I'll just insert\none here in the middle. So to do that I'll click on where\nit says insert placeholder. So under the master layout command group under the slide master\nI'll insert a placeholder. Now here are the different placeholders\nthat we can insert the content. Basically we can add anything\ntext picture chart, table, smart art media text is just for text\nonly picture chart table. Well I want a content placeholder\nthat can pretty much add anything. So I'll click on content. And just like a text box\nI have to draw it. So I'll go ahead and draw it here. We can always resize it later. Right now\nI just want to use those temporary guides to make sure they're the same height\nas the other two. And I'll snap this right here. And I think I like\nto go ahead and center align my title as well. So there we go. Let's go ahead and close the master view. Let's go ahead and insert this slide. And let's\nsee what this slide layout looks like. So now how do I find it. If I click on new slide. I can see here is my three content layout. So pretty pretty cool. So now I can always use this slide\nlayout whenever I want to. I'll go ahead and insert that here. And there it is. So I can add my title. And I have my content placeholder here on the left middle and on the right. So pretty. Pretty nice as well. Go ahead and create a three content\nlayout. Go ahead and insert it into your\npresentation and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead for lesson two. Let's go ahead and create a custom slide that we can use over and over again. I'm going to head on over\nto my title slide. Now I did insert P\nimage on my title slide. The reason I do that is because I want to\ngain some insights from the designer. So the designer really likes pictures. So if you add an image to your slide,\nyou'll get some more vibrant looking options here as well. I'm not going to insert any of them. I just want to get some insights in terms of what is modern\nand what looks pretty cool. So we can see tends to put either big picture left, big picture right or even a big picture on the top, and then add our title\nand subtitle here as well. So these look pretty good. I'm going to go ahead\nand create an actual slide. Let's see see more designs. Now we can see how we actually break down\nthis particular slide here. So how can we recreate a slide like this. This slide basically we have a picture. We have what looks like a either a shape or a text box. Here. We have a triangle\nshape down here as well. That's pretty much what these are. They're a combination of content\nplaceholders, images and different types of shapes. Now when you create a custom\nslide in the slide master, when you're actually insert that slide,\nyou will not be able to interact with the picture or any of the other objects\nthat you insert on there. Let's go ahead and head on\nover to the slide master. I'll close the designer here. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to Slide Master. Now what I want to do is\nI want to go ahead and insert a layout. If I hover over, that tells me that I can add a custom\nlayout to the master slide set. Once it's created, I can easily add slides that match the new layout\nto my presentation. Well, I'll go ahead and click on Insert\nLayout here. And we can see that\nit inserted a new layout for us. All it has on here is just the title. It's blank. We have the the footers down here as well. They custom message\nand page number in here. I'm going to rename this right away. Again I want this to be a custom\ntitle slide that I can reuse over and over again. So I'll right click on here and I'll rename this layout\nand I'll call this one title two. And there we go. So I'm going to I think what I will want\nis a big picture on the top. And then I want my title on the bottom\nright. And then my subtitle. Maybe I'll go ahead and add a logo\nover here as well. So that's what I'll do. So to do that\nI'll go ahead and click on the insert tab. I'll look for a stock image. And I want something related to learning. I know exactly the picture I want. So I'll scroll down. There it is. Nice chalkboard here. Beautiful colors that are in there. I'll go ahead and start that one. You can insert any picture you want. So this picture is actually very,\nvery good. It actually takes up the entire slide. Sometimes you insert a picture and it's\nmore fit to either align it to the left or to align it to the top. So I do want to\nwhat I'm going to do is crop this picture because I don't have any space down here. I do not want to overlay the text on it. So I'm going to cut out. I don't want to cut out the chairs\nthat look really nice or cut out. Maybe I'll crop the bottom and just\na little bit from the top here as well. That will give me a little bit of room\nto be able to add my title, subtitle and my logo as well. So I'll click on the picture format and I'll click on the cropping tool here. There we go. And I'll crop it from the bottom up to about here. And I'll come down to about here. I'll click away from it. There we go. I'll move it up to the top here. Bam! That's pretty good. I could probably even crop it\na little more, but I'll keep it simple here. Now I want to go ahead and find my title. So my title is hiding behind my pictures. If I move my picture, I'll see my title. There. So what I'll do is\nturn on the selection pane. I can click on Picture Format\nand turn on the selection pane. I also have it under my designs here. So I'll just turn on the selection pane. I'll go ahead and locate my title. And once I have it selected\nI can use the arrow keys on my keyboard. Just move it down. I can also just bring it forward\nif I want to. But for now, I'll just go ahead and move\nit down here to the bottom. I do want to align it to the right,\nso I'll bring it to the right here. Doesn't need to be that big either. Maybe I'll go to\nabout the middle of the slide. And as far as the text, I'll make that 32. And I'll also bring it up here as well. I'm going to turn off my footers. So if I go back to the slide master\nI can toggle the footers off here. It's going to turn them off for now. Don't really need them right now. But that's pretty much how you would\ninsert footers from the slide master. So here we go. I'm going to go ahead and insert\nanother placeholder. This will be for my subtitle. So I want a text placeholder. I'll drop it down here. This is going to be just a level one item. So I'll delete\nall of the other levels here. And this is not a bulleted list. I'll use my quick toolbar here to remove the bullets. And as far as a text,\nI want to pick up one of the colors from the picture here,\nso I'll use the eyedropper and I'll pull in the color here as well. So I'm good to go. That looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and align\nthis a little more. Right now I'll go ahead and insert a I'll insert an icon. Something to do with learning. I'll go ahead and grab this one. So this is another type of object. And this one is giving me\nissue issues as well. So I'll click on the graphic. I use my arrow keys\nto kind of move that around here. And maybe what I'll do is aligned that to the. To the bottom and then to the left. Here. I'm good to go. If I wanted to do something else\nI got a little accent. I could do that. So I'll just insert a shape\nto kind of show what that looks like. I'll, put a little. Let's see. Let me just a line. I'll draw a line right through here. There we go. All right. That looks pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and close these. The slide master. Now let's go ahead and insert that. So I'll click on New Slide. And here's my title to if I insert that\nthat's what it looks like. And it looks pretty good. So if I wanted to make any changes\nI can simply go back into the slide master,\nclick on the slide and move things around. But here I can go ahead and add my content. And I'll say Community Day. And I'll say something like learn with us as well. Notice\nI cannot interact with the icon here, or that line shape or that picture. The only things I can interact with\nare the content placeholders. So when you're designing,\nif you add any shapes or images or any objects that remain flat\non the canvas, which makes it possible for us to create these types of designs\nhere as well. Go ahead and create a custom title. Make any changes if you need to. For example, if I wanted to go ahead\nand go back to the slide master. So if I wanted to maybe align my text to the right. And once I close the master view and go back, I can see now\nit's aligned to the right as well. Go ahead and insert\na custom title slide or two. Go ahead\nand insert it and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nnumber three customizing design templates. Now when you're creating a template in PowerPoint, typically\nyou're saving a couple of slide layouts. You also creating\nand saving a theme and a design as well. We want to go ahead and lock in the layout\nthat we've created so far. So if we click on New Slide,\nhere's our title, our custom title slide. And here's our three content\nlayout as well. But what if we wanted\nto make some other changes, such as change the color scheme\nthat's available, and maybe change the font\nfor the entire presentation? I did apply the Georgia font\nto all of my titles. We can see it's Georgia, but\nfor everything else, that's the default font style here for PowerPoint. So what I'm going to do\nis I'm going to go ahead and create my own theme\nby choosing my own colors and fonts. And then we'll go ahead\nand save this as a template. I'll head on over to the slide master\nand I'll click on the view tab. Go back to Slide Master. So at this point what I want to do\nI want to go ahead. I can either choose a theme. So let's preview those first. If I click here\nand I simply choose one of these themes, I can see how the theme will update\nall of my slides for me. But what if I'm not finding a theme\nthat I want? What if I want to use my own colors\nand my own fonts? Typically that's\nwhat we will do in the slide master. I'll click on the colors here, and you can see I have some different paths\nto choose from. So depending maybe on Trump,\nmaybe I'm trying to brand this presentation\nand I want a particular color set. I can go ahead and choose\none of these existing ones here as well. Additionally, if I want to,\nI can even take it a step further. I can create my own color palette. The way to do\nthat is by clicking on Customize Colors. Once you're here,\nwe just need to go ahead and name it and go ahead and choose\nall of these colors that we want. So this is typically where you would put\nyour company colors to be able to brand the presentation. Once you do that,\nit will appear in the custom area. And as you can see, I have a couple of color palettes here. Okay. Right now\nI just want to choose an existing palette. And I'm going to go ahead and I'll choose. I'll go with the. Blue to. So I've chosen my color set. Now every time I want to modify something I'll see that\nthose colors are now available. I want to choose my own font as well. So I'll go ahead and click on fonts. And I want to use the Georgia font not just for this particular slide\nbut all of my slides. So I'll scroll down to Georgia here. I'll click here. And we can see everything now is Georgia. I go back to my slide master here. I can see Georgia here as well. So basically I chose my own color palette. I chose my own font. If I want to, I can even add a an effect. I'll go for a glossy effect. These effects, they're very subtle. They appear in things like charts\nand tables and other types of visuals. Not really for text here as well. So that's it. So from here, what I can do is\nI can go ahead and lock all this. And by saving this as a template. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on the file tab. I'll go ahead and click on save as. And I can do it there if I want to. Or I can press the F12 key on my keyboard. Now once I'm in here what I need to do\nis simply change the presentation type. So I want to save the type,\nnot as a PowerPoint presentation,\nbut as a PowerPoint template. So I'll click on this drop down first. I'll scroll down to PowerPoint template. Here it is. Now notice\nwhen I change this to a template save type automatically. Jumps to the folder. The default folder that houses all of my\ncustom office templates here as well. So we don't want to change that location. The only thing we want to do\nis go ahead and rename it and press save. So I'll go ahead and leave this\nas the name. I'll press save and that's it. So this has been saved as a template. The next time I open PowerPoint right from my start screen,\nI can see that template. And now I'll have all of the colors,\nfonts, effects, slide layouts, custom slides. Any changes that I've made\nwill be locked into the template. I'm going to go ahead\nand close the master view. Then the next thing to do\nis to be able to find our templates. I'll click on the file tab here and you'll notice it appears right here on your recent files from the home\nbutton there. So what I like to do is\nI like to go ahead and pin it right away. So I will always show up on my pin files. We'll go ahead and pin that. There we go. So now it's pinned. If I click on my pin files I can see it in here. It's right here. So I can always access that file. The traditional way to access\nyour templates is to click on the new tab. Here. And when you go down we'll notice\nthat we have office templates. So this is from Microsoft's gallery. We want custom. So if I have existing templates\nclick on the new tab. Click on custom. And then I'll have my custom office\ntemplates. If I click right here here are the different templates. Here's the recent one that I created. And basically the way that this works is\nif I were to open this file, PowerPoint will produce a copy\nof that presentation for me. The original template\nwould remain untouched here as well. So that's the benefit of working\nwith a template. We can reuse it\nover and over and over again if we want to make any changes\nto the template. We can go ahead and open it\nfrom the folder structure on our computer\nand make any changes and resave it. And that template\nwill be updated here as well. So go ahead and go back into the slide\nmaster. Go ahead and choose a color scheme. Choose a font. Go ahead and save your presentation\nas a template and just confirm that you can see it in\nyour custom templates folder. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nfor creating infographics. We're going to create smart art. And then we will go ahead and modify\nsmart art. And once we're finished we'll have the\ncapability to animate smart art as well. Now what exactly is smart art? Smart art is a way of creating\ninfographics and Microsoft PowerPoint. So really, there's no need\nto search the web for an infographic. We have an extensive library in PowerPoint that you can use\nto create your own infographics. We want to get to this library\nof smart art graphics that we can create. We can see that we have different\nsections, such as if you want to express an infographic as a list,\na process cycle, so forth, and so on. What we'll talk about is how we can convert smart art from existing content. I'll also take a look at how we can go\nahead and insert a smart art graphic,\nand then add our own content to it. So an infographic is basically text\naccompanied by either shapes or images. So in this example\nI have a basic list here. Just step one, step two, and step three. Very generic. We're going to convert this into\nan infographic and we'll watch it evolve. As we do that. So I can either express my steps\nhere in the form of a bulleted list. As such or what I can do. Let me go ahead and highlight my list,\nand then I'll use Microsoft to convert this into an infographic. To do that,\nI need to first highlight my my list. And on the home tab in the paragraph\ncommand group. Here is smart art. If you hover\nover, it tells you exactly what it does. Convert text on your slide\nto a smartart graphic such as a diagram, flowchart, so forth\nand so on. If I click on the drop down,\nI see just a short list of infographics that I can create. For example, here's\nthe first one a vertical bulleted list. So as you can see, if I were to choose\nthis one, I'll get those really nice rounded rectangle shapes there\nto accompany my text. Here's\nanother type of vertical block list. So we have smaller rounded rectangles. And if we wanted to add a picture to it we can go ahead and do that here as well. So lots of different graphics in here. It's time to explore\nand see what is a available. Some of these are different. Here's an org chart. So if you want to create an organization chart\nyou can pretty much do that in PowerPoint. Here's another variation hierarchy. So we can express something as a list a hierarchy a process cycle. So lots of different options\nthat we can use here. We're going to go ahead and click on\nmore Smartart graphics. Let's take a look at the library\nto get an understanding of what we can do. So here's the full smart art library. And basically PowerPoint is asking us\nto choose a smart art graphic. Well, we can choose whether we want\nto express something as a list or something as a cycle, or even as a matrix. So different ones here\nwhen you click on the list. So in this case\nI want to express something as a process step 1 to 3 I have a basic process here. Here's a preview of what\nthis would look like. On the bottom we have a brief explanation\nof how the Smartart graphic works. Here's the second one a step up process. We have a step down process here as well. Now when you're creating an infographic,\nyou can keep it very simple or you can make it more complex. So as we can see down here,\nwe have some more complex infographics or smart art. And we can see that we have a more in-depth explanation of how this works. It's all based on levels. So when you're creating a list,\nit's all based on level one, 2 or 3 items. So different smart art graphics\nwill incorporate different levels. Some. Some only allow 1 or 2. Some will allow more than two as well. For for relations\nwe can see we have some really complex ones in here, such as a balance scale. And we have a lot of verbiage here\nkind of explaining how that works. So what I'd like for you to do,\ngo ahead and highlight your text and then go ahead and try out some of the different smart arts. We can always change it\nonce we select one. So if I select the vertical bullet list here,\nI can always change it a little later. So go ahead and check them out. If you're feeling adventurous, click\non the more smart art graphics here and take a look at the different options\nthat are available and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and create an infographic\nhere. We're going to go ahead and highlight\nmy text and go on to. I'll start\nwith a vertical bullet list here. Now when you start with your smart\nart graphic you'll notice that we have\na smart Art design contextual tab. So just like all of the other objects,\nwe can change the layout. We can change the style. So as you can see we have a white outline. We have a glossy effect here\na shadowy effect. So there's a lot of different things\nthat we can do here. We can change the colors. And over here on the far\nleft is where we can basically control our smart art graphic. So if we wanted to add another shape\nor move things around, we can do that as well. But I want to introduce it\nto our little text pane here on the left. And basically this is how I prefer\nto manage my Smartart graphic. So again it's based on the levels here. I only have level one items in here. If you're not seeing this text pane, just make sure to go ahead\nand click on this little arrow here. And this will open\nup the text pane for you. So I'll click here and there we go. If I wanted to do something like add\nanother step I can just add another bullet there. And as you can see it's already adding\nthat fourth shape for me. So if I say step four. I can do that as well. Now if I continue working with the list,\nif I press the enter key after step one and I press tab over. So now I have a level two item. The level two item has its own\nnot really a shape, but just a small area here\nthat we can use. So I want to keep it simple. I'm going to remove step four. So I'll delete step four from my list. You'll notice the shape goes away. And for step one I'm just going to go ahead and put a level\ntwo item for each of my steps. Here. So I'll keep it simple here. And as a matter of fact if I already had a bulleted list\nI can copy and paste it in here. If I wanted to. And that will actually create the smartart\ngraphic for me as well. But for here, I'll keep it simple. I'll just go with a project management template here. So I'll define the project. Step two. I'll tap over and I'll say identify stakeholders. And for step number three I'll go ahead and add tasks. So that's how the smart art graphic works. So we have three here. So that's a simple way\nthat we can modify it. Now what I can do\nif you want to move things around well what you can do\nis click on one of the shapes here. And on the smart art design tab over here\non the far left. This is where we can do things\nlike move this down on the list, or we can move it up, or we can promote\nor demote, or we can add a shape. So we can either manage the list here to manage the smart art, or we can use the Create Graphic command\ngroup to manage the smart art as well. So for example, if I wanted to move step\none down, notice how it moves the level one\nand the level two item down as well. I can go ahead and move that back up. And maybe I want to promote the fine project as a level one item. So it does it here. And it gives gives its own shape as well. I'll go ahead and move that\nand I'm good to go. So that's the basics of how we use the text pane to modify smart art. Now let's take a look at something else\nhere. Let's click on the smart Art design tab. And what if I want to change the colors. I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll click on the color palette here. And we have three options\nfor the primary colors based on the theme\nthat we currently have selected. Just get\nthe preview, see what that looks like. And then we have five colorful palettes\nto choose from. So these are all incorporating the accent colors\nbased on the theme that you have selected. If I scroll down we have different\nvariations of each accent color. So it's really up to you\nwhat you want to use. I typically like\nto use the colorful scheme here as well. Once we change the colors,\nwe can head on over to smart art styles. And as you can see,\nthere's a few styles to choose from here. The first one gives a white outline\nand a little shadow as well. So that makes it look pretty nice. And then we have a subtle effect. Here's the moderate effect. And it gets more intense\nas we go to the right. So this one has a gloss. And it also has a shadow. And we have polished and gets a little more interesting\nas we go through here as well. So different orientations\nof the smart art graphic. I'll go back. I'll just choose the moderate effect here as well. So that is how we insert and modify\nsmart art. Go ahead and create your own\nsmart art graphic and come right back. In our last lesson,\nwe saw how we can create an infographic from existing content. Let's\ngo ahead and move on to the next slide. And this time we'll go ahead and insert\nsmart art and then add our content. Now I can click on smart Art right here\ninside of my content placeholder that will insert my smart art for me. I can also click on the insert tab. And the illustrations command group. Here's the smart art here as well. I'll go ahead and click on the insert\na smart Art graphic right from my content placeholder. And again, here's the entire library\nof what we can go ahead and insert. I want to express something as a process. So lots of different processes here\nthat I can. I can use we can integrate pictures\nin there as well. We'll get to pictures in\njust a little bit. Let's go ahead and keep it simple. I'll go ahead and insert\na step up process. I'll go ahead and press okay. So here's the shell of our smart art. Again\nwe have the smart Art contextual tab. And over here\nwe have our little text pane. Now what I can do\nI can either type the information in here or I already have the information I want. I'll go back to my other slide. I'll open up the text pane for this\nsmart art graphic, and I'll just copy and paste this list\nright into here. So if you ever already have an existing\nlist, you can simply copy and paste it in here. What I want to do first though, is\npress Ctrl A inside of my text pane. Here and delete everything first,\nbecause if I paste it in, it's going to just append that to the existing smart art. So I'll go ahead and right click. I'll go ahead\nand use the destination theme. And there is my smart art graphic. So all my levels are intact here as well. So that looks pretty good. But what if I want to go ahead and change\nthe smart art graphic to something else? I'll go ahead and click on the smart\nArt design tab here. And right over here under layouts. I'll get some similar layouts\nthat I can choose from. So I'll go ahead\nand maybe choose this first one here. Here's the step down process. That's what that would look like. Here's the accent process\nthat looks pretty good as well. And here's the picture accent process. So this actually incorporates pictures. I'll go ahead and click on this one. And so now we're given another shape with a picture placeholder. So I'm going to go ahead\nand take it a step further. I'll use three images that kind of communicate defining the project identifying and tasks here as well. So to do that I'll go ahead and click\non the placeholder either here or on my text pane here. It doesn't matter. I'll go ahead and click here. And I can either insert in a picture\nor I can use an icon. I prefer to use an icon\nbecause they're always the same size one inch by one inch pictures. We may need to crop the pictures to make\nthem fit inside of our smartart graphic. So I'll go ahead and grab an icon here. Here's my icon library. So I want something to represent\ndefining or yes, defining the project. So I'll search for let's say target. There we go. Like this graphic\nI'll go ahead and choose this one. I'll choose the fill colored\none as opposed to the outline. So I'll go ahead and choose this here. Here's my graphic behind it. For the next one, I'll look for a search icon. Search or find. And because we want to go ahead\nand identify the stakeholders. So maybe I'll. Maybe I'll use this one. A little hard to see it. Maybe I'll change that. And the last one\nshould be pretty simple to find. I'll just type tasks and I'll get a couple of task\nlists here as well. I'll go for it. I'll go for this one. That looks okay. Go ahead. Insert that. So here my three icons think I'm going to go ahead\nand change my second icon here. Here we go I want to first select it. Now I can right click on it. And I can change the graphic from icons. And I'll type find. Probably going to have the same issue. Let's see. Look for community. Here we go. Maybe I'll go with this one. Identify stakeholders. And there we go. So that's how we can change\nthe smart art graphic to another layout. And this is how we can integrate pictures\nin here as well. Now I want to make\nthis look a little nicer. So I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll give it a colorful but colorful palette. Here. There we go. So that looks pretty nice. Now I can, if I wanted to. I can make changes to the individual\nobjects here. So the arrow, all these\nI can go ahead and change. So if I wanted to go ahead\nand change the color of this icon, notice that we have the graphics format tab here that's available. If I wanted to do that\nI can simply go ahead and recolor it by applying a style or giving it a different different\ngraphic fill color. If I wanted to here,\nI wanted a standard color. I can go ahead and do that as well. So that's what we can do. So we can change the color. We can have smart art just kind of update the colors for us. I'll go ahead and give this a\nI'll give this a white outline. That looks pretty nice. And now the beauty of this is once I have my smart art,\nif I want to go ahead and change, I can. So if I wanted to change this\ngraphic, it's a matter of just hovering over the different ones\nand see which one I like. Here. That looks pretty nice as well. Sometimes the when you add a picture and you change the smartart, any type of arrows will will show up\nin the form of that picture. It's not really happening here, but so pretty nice. Let's see. Are there any other picture ones here? There's another picture. So this is a ascending picture process. So there we go. Now if I wanted to\nI can go ahead and just click on more layouts. This looks pretty nice. This gear icon here as well. I'll go ahead and click on more layouts. And I'll look for some of the other\nSmartart graphics that are available in the picture. Command group. And I'll take a look at those. So here is the another type here. I don't really like that. Not all of these will work because again,\nsome of them have their own type of requirements\nand they only allow a certain amount of levels. So it's just a matter of once\nyou incorporate those pictures, choose\nthe layout that you like and we're good to go. I'll go ahead and stick with this one. And maybe I'll change the colors here as well. And there we go. So go ahead and insert your smart art. Go ahead and insert some icons\nor even some images. See what they look like and come\nright back. Welcome to module four. For module four we'll go ahead and explore working with media and animations. Video. Collaborating on a presentation will customize our slideshow behavior. So what are some of the things\nthat we can kind of establish before we run our slideshow? And then we'll wrap up by using some of the newer tools\nto automate a slideshow. Go ahead and open up the module\nfor practice file and come right back. We'll dive right into module four. Here's my module for practice file. I'll jump into slide number two,\nwhich is lesson five. So for lesson five. It's all about working with media. We'll go ahead and insert\na local video file. And then we'll insert an online video\nhere as well. To insert media\nwe want to get to this media command group\nthat can be found on the insert tab. And over here we can insert videos from our device from the stock library. Also online videos. We'll take a look at the different sources\nthat we're able to stream videos from. When it comes to audio. You can either record your own audio\nusing a microphone, or you can go ahead and upload\na audio file from your computer as well. And we also have the screen\nrecording tool, which we'll take a look at\njust a little bit here. I want to take advantage\nof the content placeholder here, and I'll insert my video by clicking on\nthe Insert Video Content placeholder. So this allows me to basically upload a video from my computer locally. So I'll go ahead\nand insert this video here. And here is my video. Now once we insert the video\nwe can resize it. It's an object to cycle of the other\nobjects that we've been interacting with. So as expected we have a contextual tab. We actually have two. One is for video format\nand one is for playback. Well if I click on video format\nI can do things like, you know, choose a quick style. I can place it in an oval if I want to, or maybe give it a nice reflection, a simple shadow,\nor just a simple frame here as well. So I can do any of those things. Well,\nI want to go ahead and just run this slide and let's\nsee what this actually looks like. So I'll go ahead\nand I'll run this in reading mode. And I'll go ahead and play my video. So as we can see\nI can have some basic controls here such as I can play it,\nI can skim through it. And I can also adjust\nthe volume here as well. So this is kind of the default\nout of the box. Let's go ahead and make some formatting\nchanges to here as well. Press escape. Come back here. So if I click on here\nmaybe the first thing I'll do. I'll click on video format. I'll go ahead and put this in a frame. Maybe I'll put it in a go for this. Rounded rectangle here. So I'll put it in that frame. I can make it bigger if I want to as well. So I've placed it in a frame. And over here I can go ahead and play it to get a nice preview\nof what it would look like. Just like with our image tools,\nI can go ahead and give it some corrections, make it brighter,\nor have more contrast as well. I can even recolor it if I want to. And we have some other\npretty nice tools here as well. But that's about it for the video format. I just want to give it a quick style. I'll go to the playback here. And when we click on the playback context or tab, we can see that\nwe have some editing tools here that we can use such as trimming the video, fading in and out. And then we have some other video options here. This will basically establish\nhow the video behaves once we get to this slide. Let's take a look at the trim\nvideo feature. I'll click on Trim video. And in this particular video there was\na lot of whitespace in the beginning. So maybe I don't want to start. Maybe I want to start. Let me write about here. I'll start with that question. What brought you to learn it today? So maybe you're right about there, right. So just by moving that slider, I'm\nstarting at 14.9 seconds here as well. At the end I had a little\nsome more space in here as well. Maybe I'll stop right here\nas soon as the learned logo appears. That's it. I can even use these little arrows\nto kind of determine the starting point. That helps a little better. I'll go ahead and press. Okay. And let's preview it. There you go. So it started with the question as opposed to starting\nfrom the very beginning there as well. All right. So I already trim the video. I'll go ahead and establish the volume. I'll make sure that the volume is medium. I don't want it to be high\nfor my audience. And I want it to play automatically. So whenever I navigate to the slide,\nthis will play automatically here as well. And I want to play it in full screen mode. So I can go ahead and do that. And I'm good to go. So let's go ahead and run this and reading view. Let's see what this looks like. That's what my other half. So there you go. So we can see that\nthe volume has been set to medium. And it's playing in full screen here. And also played automatically. So I'll go ahead and escape and go back to my slide here as well. So go ahead and insert a video. Hopefully you have one.\nGo ahead and insert it. Take a look at the different tools\nunder the Video Format tab. And go ahead and trim the video. Make it start automatically. And also go ahead and play it\nfull screen and come right back. And this segment will go ahead and insert\nonline video. Now I'm actually\ngoing to insert a new slide. So I'll just press control\nM and start a new slide. And I'll change this layout to title only because I want to insert a nice big online\nvideo here from our YouTube site. So this will be an online video. So to insert an online video, if I click\non the insert tab and here is video. So I have the option to insert video from the online stock videos. Or I can grab from various sources\nhere as well. I'll click on online videos\nand what kind of just preview what's available in the stock\nvideo library. I'll click on online videos here. And we're giving some information. So these are the different sources\nthat we can stream video from. So YouTube SlideShare Vimeo\nstream and flip. So we basically need to grab the address or the URL of that video\nand paste it in here. Once we paste it in here\nwe'll get a nice preview of the video. Just ensuring\nthat we have the correct one. So I'm going to go ahead and jump over to our YouTube page\nwith the video that I want to stream here. There we go. So this is the video. I'll go ahead and play this here\ntraining exercise files for today. Okay. So to grab the video address\nI can just right click here and I'll copy the video URL. Once that's on my clipboard here I'll head back over to my PowerPoint. So right here\nI'll go ahead and paste the video so I can you can right\nclick and paste the video in there. Or you can press Ctrl V and we can see it shows up here. So here's my little tutorial on Microsoft\n365 basics. We can preview the video right here. Welcome to learn. And there we go. So even though it's an hour and 26 minutes\nlong we're streaming it. So as long as you have an internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. This is not being stored\nin our PowerPoint, so it's not taking up space, as is the video\nthat we uploaded from our computer. I'll go ahead and click on insert. And here is my video. So I can either have it\ntake up the entire slide like that. Or I can go ahead and resize it. If I click on the video format,\nI can still do things like I can. Correct it. I can recolor it. If I want to, I can even go ahead\nand place it in a frame. So maybe I want to place it in a frame\nlike this. I can do that. Or simple frame. Now if I click on the playback tab here, notice that these options over here,\nthey're grayed out. So none of the editing controls\nanything I can do really is to just decide whether I want this\nto play in sequence. Me meaning I have to click on it, or if I wanted to play it\nautomatically here as well. I'll go ahead and choose automatically. So we don't have all the tools\nbecause we don't really know. This is this video is being streamed. We don't own the video, so we cannot edit\nit here as well. I'll go ahead and click on my reading view\nhere and let's see what this looks like. Welcome to learn the training exercise files for today's. There we go. So we can kind of fast forward these here right. So depending on your internet connection\nyou should be good to go. All right\nI'll go ahead and press escape here. I'll press escape again to go back to my slide. So that is how we insert an online video\nfrom those different sources as well. Again we can play it. It works well right from the stream. We just don't have all of the normal bells\nand whistles that we have. If we actually own the video. I'm going to go ahead and delete this. I'll just press the delete key\nto get rid of it. And let's just take a look at the\nthe stock of online video. I'll click on the insert tab. I'll go back over to video. And let's take a look\nat some of the stock videos. Here. So these are not really long videos. They're pretty short. Maybe in the range of 9 to 15 seconds. And let's see I'll go ahead and grab this one here\nI'll go ahead and insert this. So it took up the entire slide. But again you can always resize it. We can just like what\nthere are other objects. We can resize them. I'm okay with it\ntaking up the entire slide though. That's perfectly fine. So I can go ahead and play it here. And this is going to be about nine\nseconds. Just a little over\nnine seconds here as well. So if I were to preview this for go on reading mode. So there you go. Pretty cool. I'll press the escape key and let's see what options\nwe have available. So this is from the stock. So we can still do the same things\nwith the video format. We can place it in a frame if we want to. Maybe I'll put it in a frame like that. We have the corrections\nthat we can use as well. And as far as playback,\nbecause this is from the stock, we do have the capability\nto trim the video. So we can actually trim the video\nif we want to. We can specify when it starts,\nwhen it ends. We can also opt to play it full screen. So all of the other options that we have there are pretty much good to go here\nas well. Right now one of the things is the\nwe have what's called a poster frame. And this allows us to basically\nput a poster on the first\nfirst glance at the video here. So if I wanted to maybe show this part, I can go ahead and click on Poster frame and I'll say this will be the starting frame for my actual video here. You can also go ahead and insert an image. So if you wanted to insert\nan image from file, that's basically what you'll see\nbefore you actually play the video. So if I click play here. There we go. So that's what it's all about. Inserting videos\ninto your PowerPoint presentation. Either the stock library online sources or a video locally from your device. The screen recording is a really nice tool in PowerPoint. Many of us are not aware\nthat we can actually record our screen. No need to buy an expensive program. We have one built in right here. After we recorded our screen,\nit will insert the recording right onto our slide for us here as well. So if I click on screen recording\nis going to minimize my PowerPoint window. Whatever is in the background\nwill be brought to the front here as well. I'll click on Screen recording. Let's take a look at the what's available. So as you\ncan see when we're recording the screen, we can select the area of our screen\nthat we want to record. Mine is already pre-selected. If you want to record your audio\nyour voice or your microphone,\nyou can go ahead and turn on the audio. And if you want to record\nyour mouse pointer, you can go ahead and record that as well. I'll record my audio. I'll record my pointer here as well. And I'll go ahead and select my area. But first what I want to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and just kind of resize my. My window here for Microsoft Edge. And I'm going to bring it down. One of the things that happens\nwith the screen recorder, this little toolbar here gets in the way\nsometimes when you're recording. So I want to make sure that my recording area is below that box. So I'll go ahead and reselect my area. I'll just draw a box around my Microsoft Edge window here. Like that. And there we go. So what you can do if you want to record\nyour entire screen, when you want to stop or pause your recording,\nyou can use the shortcut key. So windows logo shift plus Q\nthat will stop the recording for you. This way you don't have to go back\nto the top of your screen. Expose\nthis little toolbar here and click on Stop Recording because that will show up\non your recording at least the last time I did it, that's\nwhat happened. I'll go ahead and click on record. I'll get a countdown. I'll get a quick reminder of what\nthe shortcut is to stop the recording. Let's go ahead and do that. So in this case, I'll just demonstrate\nhow to sign up for a course at learn App.com. Let's get started\non how to sign up for a course app. Learn App.com. Let's first go to.learning.com. Once we're here, we can either go ahead\nand sign in or register. Or if you want to go ahead and view\nall classes, we can click here. Once we're here,\nwe can search for any class of interest. Or we can scroll down to see our upcoming\ncourses here as well. Here's an Excel Introduction course. I'll go ahead and click on here. So it gives me the details\nwhat will be covered. And it also shows the upcoming schedule\nfor these classes as well. Maybe I'll go ahead and take a little break and then February\nI want to go ahead and take this course. So I'll click on my little\nplus icon here to add this to the cart, and I'll remove the other one. I'll go to check out. And from here I simply just need to go ahead\nand click on the next step and continue the login registration payment\nand confirmation process. And I am good to go. And that's all to it. So there we go. I was able to do a just a small recording\nthere about a minute and 15 seconds. You can see it inserts the recording\nfor us right here onto the slide. Again we can resize this if we want to. Doesn't necessarily\nhave to take up the entire screen. What I'll do is\nI'll just go ahead and center it. Kind of align things a little better here on the slide. There we go. And so we can go ahead and play it. And as we can see\nof course my voice records my. Let's first go to my cursor as well dot learn it.com. So really really nice tool. Now because we inserted this screen\nrecording we have all of the tools\nall of the editing tools. Right. So if we wanted to trim\nthe video we can kind of preview it right. Make sure everything looks good. If it doesn't we can always go ahead\nand just trim different parts of the video here as well. We have all of the other tools\nthat we can go ahead and use. As we mentioned before,\nif you have offline captions, you can go ahead and insert captions\nfor the for the the video as well. So it's a really nice tool,\na really nice tool to use as a learning or as a help aid. Right. So a really nice option here as well. Go ahead and take advantage of the screen\nrecording tool. Go ahead and upload 1 or 2. The good thing is once we're done\nwe can go ahead and save this. So if you make any changes to it on the playback tab we can click on\nSave Media as you can do the same thing by right clicking on the video\nand clicking on Save Media. As we can save as a media file, or we can\neven save it as a picture here as well. So we can save it as a picture. We can save the media as a media file. So pretty cool. Go ahead and play around with the screen\nrecording tool and come right back. Welcome back. And let's\ngo ahead and move on to lesson number six. So we'll talk about collaborating\non a PowerPoint presentation here. So there's a couple of things\nthat we need to do. We first need to go ahead\nand save our presentation to OneDrive. And after we do that we can go ahead and share the presentation. And once once we have uploaded it to either\nOneDrive or SharePoint we can share it. We can go ahead and view different\nversions of the file here as well. So you can either click on the file\ntab and click on Save As. Go ahead and save it\nto one of your OneDrive spaces. Or if you have the share icon here, click on Share. It's going to first\nask you to go ahead and upload it to your OneDrive,\nand then you can share it. I'll go ahead and save it,\nand then I'll come back once I have that saved. Now that I have it saved, what I can do\nis click on the share icon here. So I'll go ahead and click on share and we get to this dialog box. Now this dialog box has had some changes recently. Looks a little different\nbut this is the modern version of it here. So what I can do is\nI first need to decide, well, who do I want to share this document with? How do I want to share it and what\ntype of access do I want them to have? Right? So I can either copy a link and send that link out\nvia email or by teams chat or any other medium\nand anyone that has that link. They can either edit\nor they can view the particular file here. Well, this is collaboration. I want to go ahead and send it to Adele was on my sandbox account,\nso I'll go ahead and type in Adele here. I'll make sure that Adele\ncan edit to make changes. And I'll just say please edit. And that's pretty much it. Once I go ahead and press send,\nI'm good to go. If I want more advanced options,\nI can go ahead and click on the sharing settings here. And I'll have some other options. But I have everything I need\njust on this very first window here. I'm sending this via outlook to Adele Edit Access, and I'm\ngoing to go ahead and send it here. Right. So I'll go ahead and close this out. Let's head on over to Adele's mailbox. See if we get that message here. I'll go ahead and refresh. Here it is. So just came in. This is what the message looks like. A file has been shared with you. Here's the custom message. I'll go ahead and click on open here. And this will open up online. Now my recipient will have the option\nif they want to open in the desktop app. They can do that as well. But to keep it simple\nwe'll just open the file here in the web. And here we go. So here is the here's Adele's\nversion of the file. And Adele\ncan see that I'm working in here. My avatar appears here\nbecause I'm currently in the file and I'm working on it. If I scroll down, we can see exactly. I'm currently on this slide\nfor lesson six. Well, that's where we need to go. So I'll go ahead\nand here and I'll add a task. So I'll say task two. And the owner here will be Adele. And I'll say that this has not yet\nstarted. And progress is 0%. So let's see what that looks like. I'll go back to my desktop copy here. Now you can see the changes\nhave already been made. I can see that Adele is showing up\nas a guest contributor. And I can see Adele is right here on slide number five. Right. So I'll go ahead and put myself in here. Now we can keep on editing here as well. So task three is going to be nester. Now what I can do if I click on the review tab\nI can add comments in here. Right. So maybe I want to add a comment\nregarding task number three. I'll go ahead and put a\ncomment in here and I'll say please confirm with Master. So this is the whole concept behind\ncollaborating. You can comment in here. We can work on the file together\nand we're good to go. Let's go back to the and let's see here. Let's click on the review tab. And let's click on Show comments. All right so here here are the comments here as well\nthat we can see. So that's pretty cool. So we can go ahead and make some changes\nI'll go ahead and reply to this. And I'll say I will take care of that. Go ahead and post the reply here as well. And so there we go. So it's a matter of saving to OneDrive\nand or SharePoint, sharing the document with edit Access and being able to mark up the document\nat the same time here as well. I can even see the notes that are in here. Let's go ahead and take a look\nat the different versions of the document. I'll go back to. Here. I'll click on the file tab and I'll click on info. And now what I can see is the version\nhistory. It's on the info tab. Here is the version\nhistory of the document. Now let's see what versions\nhave been captured so far. I'll click here. And so far\nsince I uploaded it and saved it, I can see that\nthree versions have been saved. Here's the version as of 1105 1109, and 1111 as well, right? So what I can do is\nI can go ahead and open a older version here. Let's see what this one looks like. So right now we have three tasks. So this kind of opens up the. That version. So we can see\nthe current version has three tasks. This version only has two tasks in here. So this is pretty helpful\nbecause sometimes some changes are made that are just too drastic. And you want to be able to fall\nback to a prior version. And so the fact that the versions\nare being saved automatically is a really,\nreally big help here as well. If I wanted to restore this version,\nI can click on restore. This would make this\nthe current version here as well. But I don't want to do that. I just want to go back to the\nto the other version here. So I'll go ahead and close this out. And it brings me back to my updated\nversion. I'll go ahead and close this pane here. And I am good to go. Now what I can do is let's see if I go over to the file tab, click back on info. And I click on protect here. So what I can do\nis I can mark this as final. But everyone will need to be logged out\nfirst. So I can let all of my collaborators\nknow that there's no more changes being made to this document,\nor marking it as final here as well. Right now, while we here is good to take a look at these things,\nwe can see the on the info tab here. We have the media size and performance. We can see that we have 68 megs here. The entire presentation is currently 71\nmegs, mostly because of the screen recording and that video that\nwe uploaded earlier as well. I'll go back here. And so\nthat's how you collaborate on a document. For less than seven. We'll talk about customizing\nslideshow behavior. So what we'll discuss\nis some of the things that we can do before we run our slideshow, and some things that we can do\nduring our slideshow as well. So sometimes you may notice\nwhen you're running your slideshow, your presenter window is either turned off\nor turned on, or it's showing up on the wrong monitor. Well, those are things that we can use to\nset up a slideshow to set up a slideshow. Let's click on the slideshow tab here. And we have an entire section here\ndevoted to setup. Now we can go ahead and click on Setup\nSlideshow. And it's going to be a combination\nof all of these different things here. Using time and timings. Using the presenter view. Things like that here as well. Let's click on Setup Slideshow. And when presented\nwith this dialog box here and there's a couple of different areas. So how do we want to run the presentation. By default when you run the presentation\nit takes up the entire screen. But if you want it to kind of\nhave it run in reading mode, you can choose the second option, right? It just runs on the window. That way\nit doesn't take up your entire screen. You can resize it. And then if you wanted to\njust kind of loop on maybe a big TV, you can go ahead\nand use the browse at a kiosk. So it's full screen. You'll notice\nif you when you check that option it's automatically going to loop until you stop the slideshow. Right. So you may walk into a building\nat a corporation. You may see the same slideshow\nor running over and over and over again. It's in kiosk mode, right? I'll go back to presented by a speaker\nfull screen. And then over here for show slides you can\ndetermine which slides you want to show. You can leave it just for all. Or we can say\nI only want to show slides 1 to 5. We can do that\nor show everything here as well. We don't have any custom shows in here. We'll talk about that\nin just a little bit. If we create some custom shows, we\ncan choose to run the custom show as well. So these things just kind of gives\nyou some, some confidence\nas you're running your slideshow, because maybe you don't want certain slides to show up\non this particular presentation. Now, in terms of of advancing\nslides, right now by default is going to use timings\nif any timings are present. So you can either adjust the timing\nfor each slide. But we're going to go ahead\nand record the entire presentation. So there's really\nno need to rehearse the timings down here\nif you're using multiple monitors. You want to make a choice. Do you want to use presenter view? Presenter view\nis a really nice thing to use because while your audience\nis seeing your presentation, you are taking a look\nat your presenter view so you can see what's coming next, either\na slide or an animation. You also have notes that you can use\nas talking points as well. So I'm going to go ahead and use\nPresenter view. And my slide show is going to run on my primary monitor. I'll leave that as is for now. I'll go ahead and press okay. And I'll go ahead and run my slide\nshow here. So here we can see\nmy slide show is running. I'll go ahead\nand switch the presenter view so that it's showing on this monitor. And let's take a look at the presenter\nview. I'll press escape. I'll go back in to set up slide show. And I want my slide show\nto run on my internal display. I'll press okay. Now I'll run my presentation. So on my other screen\nI have the slide show. But here's the presenter view. And as you can see it's pretty nice\nbecause we have any notes that we have in here. We can see what's coming up next. So this is our next slide. Lesson number eight. And right here I can just kind of navigate\nthrough my slides. If I have any animations\nI can see what's coming up next as well. And so pretty nice. What I can also do\nif I want to jump to a slide, I can open up\nmy see all slides pane right here. Now my audience will not see this on the\nI can see this. They're still seeing the current slide. So if I wanted to navigate to\nthis slide, if I click on it now that is being displayed on my audience screen here as well. Some other things I can do. I can go ahead and turn on the pan\nand laser pointer tools. So I can go ahead and just kind of use\nthose here as well. We'll talk about these\nin just a little bit. And if I wanted to go ahead and toggle my camera\nI can go ahead and turn on my camera. I can turn on the subtitles right here. So a lot of things we can do\nright from the presenter window. So if I toggle the subtitles now, it's going to be writing whatever I'm saying here. I'll go ahead and turn that off. And we have some other tools here as well. If you wanted to hide the presenter view\nyou can go ahead and do that. But we're good to go. I'll go ahead\nand end the slideshow from here. And those are just some of the basics when it comes to setting up a slideshow. I'll go back down to lesson number seven\nhere. And let's\ngo ahead and create a custom slideshow. So over here on the slideshow tab we have the custom show in the start Slideshow command group. Right. If I click on this drop down here\nI don't have any custom shows. I'll go ahead and click here. So I want to create a new custom show. Well why would you want to create\na custom show? Maybe you just have one really long,\nyou know, slide deck. You may have 30 slides, but maybe you divide that slide, that slide deck\ninto three different sections, like so. Instead of showing all 30 slides, you\nmaybe you just want to show the first ten. So I can do is click on new and I'll just call this lesson five. So I want my. Title slide. Here's lesson five. So here are the three slides that make up lesson five I'll go ahead and add those. And now I can reorder them\nif I want to move them up and down. But I'll go ahead and press okay. Now I can see\nI have less than five in here. If I go ahead and click on show,\nit's only going to show those slides. So here's my presenter view. As you can see, it's only showing those four slides\nthat make up that particular show. And we're good to go. So that is a custom show right. Now keep in mind\nwhen we setting up the slideshow we can also say\nwell let's just go ahead and run that. Lesson five custom slideshow here as well. So pretty good. Okay. Let's go ahead and stop here. I want you to be able to practice. Go ahead and just set up your slideshow. Go ahead and practice. Make sure that your presenter view\nis turned on. It's showing on there\non the screen of your choice. And go ahead and take a look\nat some of the different tools here. We'll come back\nand we'll go ahead and take a look at some of the annotating tools\nthat are available. While we are presenting. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and set up navigation\nfor our slide show. Now remember when you were presenting. If you right click you can pretty much go to a slide of your choice\nif you want to. Once we have the presenter view turned on, we can kind of jump around,\nbut it would be nice to kind of give our audience. Really\nnice feature called the zoom feature. Okay, so what the zoom feature is and I'm actually\ngoing to insert a slide here. So right up to my title slide and this will be\nI'll just call this my landing slide. And what I'm going to do\nI'll just quickly insert some links to my different lessons here. So to do that I'll go ahead and press Ctrl K on my keyboard. Okay. So this will insert a hyperlink right. So just like in the other office documents\nExcel and Word, we can link to a place in the document. So instead of linking to an existing file a web page\nI'll click on place in this document. And now what I can do\nis I can link to different slides. So I want to be able to link first to lesson five. And for the text it says lesson five. Working with media. That's perfectly fine. I'll go ahead and leave that as is. And just like that we have a hyperlink. I'll go ahead and press enter. I'll repeat the process\nfor six, seven and eight. So I'll press Ctrl k. To a place in the document\nI want to go to lesson six. I'll accept the text. I'll press okay. I'll do that two more times. Ctrl K this time. Lesson seven. And I'll go ahead and press okay. One more time. Ctrl k and this will be for lesson eight. Right. So I have a nice little landing\nslide here. So basically if I go to\nif I run this in reading mode, what I can do is I can click on this link\nwhile I'm presenting. And this will take me\nto that particular slide. Now it would be nice\nif we can go back to that landing slide. I have a little button\nthat we can click on. So we can always go back right. I want to be able to get back to\nthis slide by just clicking on a button. So we have what's called a zoom feature. I'll check this out. Look what I'm going to do here. I'll go to lesson five. And from lesson five I want to be able to go back to the landing slide. I'm going to drag my landing slide. I'm just going to click and drag it. I can drag it right onto my slide here. Maybe I'll put it right. Right here. Okay. And then I'll move this other icon\nout of the way. I'll put this down here somewhere. Right. So you're saying, well,\nwhat just happened? What did you just do? I'm just going to position\nthis up here at the top. So this is called a zoom feature. So now I have a link to a slide\nin another slide. Let's go into reading mode\nand let's see how this works. Here we go. So I'm here on this particular slide. And now if I want to go back\nto my landing slide if I click here. So it zooms in to that slide for me. And now what I can do is I can go ahead\nand jump to another lesson here as well. Right. If I press the back key\nit goes back to lesson five. Or I can just go ahead and click back here and jump back to lesson five as well. So that is the zoom feature as well. Now what I can do if I wanted to\nI can go ahead and change this. So right now\nthis is just a picture of my slide. If I click on here I'll notice that I zoom tab appears here as well. So maybe what I'll do is I'll go ahead\nand change this image to something else. And maybe I'll grab an icon. And maybe I'll look for an home icon. Maybe I'll use this one. So I've converted this to a home icon\nand I can resize it. I can even put it out of style to\nif I want to. I'll keep it simple. I'll just put it here on the top\nright of my slide. There you go. So that's my zoom feature. Now what I can do I can actually copy this and I can paste it on lesson six. I just need to move this out of the way. So I'll go ahead and paste\nthis here on lesson six. And I just copied and pasted it. Well let's see if this still works. I'll go ahead and run this slide\nin reading mode. If I click on it it brings me to my landing slide. I'll go back to lesson six and I'm good to go. So that's the zoom feature right. So go ahead and create your first zoom. Go ahead\nand change it to an icon of your choice. Again to do that just click on the zoom. Click on the zoom tab\nand you can change the image here as well. Go ahead and add that home button\nto each of your lesson slides. Now we'll be able to navigate\nback and forth as we are presenting. Now that we've added some navigation and we've set up some of the basics,\nit's time to go ahead and present and take a look at some of the tools\nthat are available. We'll already discuss the presenter view. So now we can do. Let's take a look\nat how we can annotate a presentation. How we can enable these subtitles as well. Now we can accomplish these as well\nthrough the presenter view. I'm going to go back to my slide show. Let's just make sure\nthat I'll turn off my presenter view. I don't want my slideshow to run on this\nscreen, so everything is good to go. I want to make sure\nall of my slides are selected. And from here, if I want to, I can go\nahead and choose my laser pointer color. I will be using the laser pointer. I'll be using the pen as well. So I can actually select my color\nahead of time. I'll leave them both on red. I'll go ahead and press okay. You can press F5 to start your slideshow. So here's my slideshow. I'll go ahead and head on over\nto my next slide here just by clicking. And so here's my landing slide. I'll just go to lesson five here. And here's lesson five. Now on the bottom\nwe have some kind of grayed out tools. So we can go to the last slide. We can go to the next slide. Here are the pen tools down here. So if I click here\nI can either choose my laser pointer. Right. So I can go ahead\nand just kind of point on my screen. If I go back down here. I can change that to the pen. And the pen basically allows us to just kind of mark things up. I can do things like that terrible arrow. Right. So we can do that. If I want to go back, I'll just uncheck the pen. I have my pointer back here. Now I can go ahead and either\nplay my video or go to the next slide. I'll go to my next slide here as well. And what else do I have here. Here's the highlighter. So if I wanted to highlight\nsomething turn on my highlighter. Go ahead and highlight it here. And of course we can change the color. So we can change the color\nfor all of the ink down here as well. So for my highlighter if I wanted\ninstead of yellow maybe I want orange. Here's my orange highlighter here as well\nthat I can use right. Now let's go ahead\nand I'll get my pointer back here. So I'll unselect my highlighter. If I move over to the right here's\nthe slide sorter. And here are the subtitles. So I can go ahead and turn those on. And this is what my screen now looks like. This is very helpful. And we're good to go. Great. Turn on my video if I want to. And then here are some other tools. So if I wanted to transition\nto a custom show I can even though I'm not running\nPresenter view right now, I can still go ahead\nand turn that on here as well. And for the subtitle settings, I can either show them on the top\nor it's overlaid on my presentation or I can change the location of it\nas well. Right. Maybe I'll put it up above the slide,\nthe top like that. So we have different options\nthat we can use here. Now if you didn't mark up your slide\nwe do have an eraser here as well. So you can erase them individually\nor you can choose to go ahead and erase\nall of the ink on a slide. Right. Now keep in mind when you are marking up\nyour slide here. All the ink will remain\nunless you remove it. So if I were to close my presentation here and go back to this slide, this arrow\nand this somewhat of a circle will show up as our shapes here as well. So you want to make sure it will ask you\nanyway before you close the presentation. Do you want to remove all the ink as well? But while we're here,\nlet's test out our navigation. Great. I'll get my pointer back here and I'll jump to the. Let's jump to lesson number eight. And from lesson number eight\nwe can go back to that landing slide. And jump to lesson number five. So pretty cool. So we're zooming in\nand out of our landing slide. If you press the back key after you go to your landing slide, that goes back to the slide\nthat you were on before here as well. All right. I'll go ahead and end the show. I'll just go ahead\nand press the escape key. And it asks me right here,\ndo I want to keep my annotations? I do not. Because again,\nthey will appear as shapes on your slide. I'll go ahead and discard them. And I am good to go. Great. So a lot of the things\nthat we just accomplished. Annotating. Turning on the subtitles. We can use the presenter view\nfor that as well. And we'll see\nthose options are also available. So go ahead and run your slideshow. When we come back\nwe'll put it all together. We'll take a look\nat how we can record our slideshow so that it can run automatically. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson\nnumber eight. What we want to do here is we want to\ngo ahead and automate our slideshow. Right. So we don't want to sit and click through our slides\nas we're presenting. What we'd like to do\nis to kind of record our slideshow, and then we can\ngo ahead and play it back and run it so that all the slides will transition\nautomatically. So let's take a look\nand see how we can do that. Here. If I click on the slideshow tab. I have the record option here. So I can record from the beginning\nand notice what it says. So records narrations animations\ntransitions, ink and laser pointer gestures. So everything that I'm doing\nwill be recorded here as well. So we don't necessarily\nneed to rehearse timings because now we have the recording feature\nthat will record everything for us. So what I'm going to do I want my recorder\nwindow to show up on here. So I'll just change this here. And then I'll go ahead and press okay. Just so we can see what that looks like. I'll go back to the first slide\nand I'll click on record from the beginning. And this is going to open up my\nmy recording view here. Now before we do that I highly recommend that you use this\nfeature called rehearsal with coach. This is a really, really nice tool. Basically\nyou can practice with the eye coach and it's very,\nvery intuitive and very, very robust. It's going to be providing feedback to let you know if you're talking\ntoo fast, if your pace is too slow. If your voice is monotone,\nyou're speaking too loud, too soft. If you're using filler words\nso it gives you a really nice report, kind of coaches you along the way,\nit'll say, great job, keep it up. So I highly recommend\nyou use the rehearse with coach. It will allow you\nto go through your entire slide and you can practice with it\nthere as well. Once you've done\nthat, we'll go ahead and click on record where we can also record\na slideshow from the record tab. So here's the record from the beginning. Now there's a lot of things\nthat we can do in here. We'll just touch on a few of them. So here we can see here is the window for our recording. Once we're ready we just need to go ahead\nand click on the record button. Just a few things to note. If you wanted to turn on your camera,\nyou can. Your camera will appear. I'm down here on the bottom right. So your image will appear down here\non the bottom right as well. At the very top, when you have notes,\nwe have a little teleprompter here that will help you as you're\ngoing through your actual slides. Now this is one view down\nhere on the bottom right. There are different views. So right now\nthis is the teleprompter view. Let's click on this drop down. The other one is the presenter view. So the presenter view\nthis is the one that we're accustomed to. We can kind of see what's coming next either an animation or a next slide. And we can see what our audience\nseeing here as well. Right. Then we have other things down here. Laser pointer highlighter. They're all here for us as well. The other view is the slide view. So this is just your operating\njust with the slides. And you can go through it there as well. I'm going to go back to Teleprompter view and here we go. So if you want to record your microphone you can either turn it off\nor you can turn it on as well. If we click here for more options,\nyou can select the microphone that you want to use. You can select your camera. And if you're using cameo which is a newer\nfeature, you can use cameo as well. I'm just going to do a simple recording just so that we can see what\nthe finished product will look like here. So not going to spend too much time\non each slide. Here we go. Welcome to PowerPoint module four. My name is Mo Jones. Let's go ahead and learn together. Here's our landing slide. We have four lessons. Lesson number five. Lesson number six. Lesson number seven. And then finally. Lesson number eight. Automating a slideshow. Lesson\nfive is all about working with media. We can either insert local video\nor we can insert online video. Here's my video. I can go ahead and play this here. That's all my other. Once I'm done, I can go ahead and move on\nto my next slide. Here. I'll go ahead and turn on my where is my pen so I can go ahead and just draw some shapes in here\nif I want to. I'll go to my next slide. Here's my notes at the top so I can refer to that\nas I'm going through my slides here. So when we're inserting these screen recorder it's\na matter of getting to this particular icon here or this command group,\nthe media command group on the insert tab. Remember after you insert your screen recording\nto take a look at the playback options and the other formatting options as well. Lesson six is all about collaborating. As we can see,\nwe can go ahead and share a file grant editing access and we can go ahead\nand mark up the file together. We can see who's in the file\nwhere they're currently working on, and we can add comments to the file\nas well. Lesson number seven is all about\nsome of the other default settings that we can establish\nfor our presentation, as well. Don't forget about the zoom feature. We can always click on that button\nto go back to the slide of our choice. And then finally for lesson number eight, I highly recommend\nthat you record your presentation and use the rehearse\nwith Coach tool here as well. Now when we finish the slideshow, it tells us to click here to export our video. So I'll go ahead and click there\nand I can go ahead and export it to to the location of my choice here. I'll go ahead and click on browse. Typically you want to upload it\nto your OneDrive space. I'll just put it on my desktop here. I'll just call this copy and I'll go ahead and export\nthat as a MP4 video. And that's going to take\na little bit of time to record. Once it's finished, I'll come right back. So finally I get the message\nthat my video was exported successfully. So from here I can click here to view\nthe video and share with others as well. I'll go ahead and click here. And it's asking me. I do trust it. I'll go ahead and press yes. And just giving me some security messages here. I'll just go ahead and press\nokay to open the file opens up in my default media player. And here we go. Let's go ahead and go because I let it slide me up for lessons. Lesson five. So there we go. So we can see everything has been recorded as well. And we're good to go. I'll go ahead and close this out. And we're good to go. So that is how we record a slideshow. So notice now for each slide we'll see the actual voice note\nthat was left on each slide. So every slide\nhas a little recording here. So in the past\nwe would have to do these things kind of manually insert\nthe audio insert the timings as well. But now the recording\ntakes care of everything for us as well. So go ahead to record your your show. Go ahead and export it. Go ahead and play it.\nMake sure everything is okay. If you want to go ahead and share it. Feel free to do so as well. Now that we have recorded our slideshow,\nwe see that everything was recorded well,\nwe did have the option of exporting it to a media file,\nbut something else happened as well. So if I were to go ahead\nand just run my slideshow, it's going to run automatically. So the timings for each slide,\nthe voice duration on each slide, and any ink or markup\nthat I used will be played as well. So if I did not want to play the video,\nI just want to go ahead and run the slide. I'll go ahead and run it here on the PowerPoint module for\nI had a small child and we can see the voice\nnarration is included. We can see the slides are moving\nautomatically without my interaction. Plus the number six plus number seven. And finally lesson number eight okay. Now I can still jump in if I want to,\nbut for the most part everything is happening\nautomatically here as well. So I'll press escape and we're good to go. So you can either share that video\nor play the video or you can, you can just come in and actually just run your slideshow. And here's a little bit of ink that I left when I was kind of annotating my coffee\ncup here. So I'll just click on here\nand I'll just go ahead and delete that from my slide as well. If you go back to the record tab\nnow, you'll notice that some of these other options are available\nbecause we did perform a recording. We can do some other things like clear\nthe recording on the current slide, or we can clear the recording\nfrom all of the slides. Maybe we just want to go ahead and redo\nit, right. We can save it as a show. Right. So we can create a separate slide\nwith the P as x extension there as well. We can export it to video\nfrom here as well. We can learn more to see what's new,\nwhat else we can do here as well. We can also use the cameo feature as well with our camera feed. So that's the benefit of recording a show. We can automate it. And we still have the capability\nto kind of interact with the slides, even though it's automated here as well. Just to recap, we're able\nto customize the PowerPoint environment. We saw how we can create our own ribbon tab and add our own command groups\nand our own commands as well. Even add more commands\nto our Quick Access toolbar. We took a look at the slide master. We're able to customize design templates. We're able to save a design as a template, and then we're able to create\nsome infographic fix with smart art. We're able to work with media. We're able to collaborate\non a presentation after saving the presentation\nto a cloud space. We're able to customize slideshow\nbehavior, establishing some of the default settings\nfor our slideshow, and then we're able to automate\na slideshow as well. Remember\nto use the rehearse with Coach tool and then go ahead\nand record your slideshow. Congrats on completing the course and\nlook forward to seeing you in a future. Learn it! Course."
