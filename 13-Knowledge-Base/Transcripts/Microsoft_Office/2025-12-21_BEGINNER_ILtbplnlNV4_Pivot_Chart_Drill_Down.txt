0:00 Excel pivot chart drill down buttons are
0:02 an intuitive way for your users to drill
0:04 up and down through a hierarchy right on
0:07 the face of a chart they're technically
0:09 expand and collapse buttons and they are
0:11 introduced in Excel 2016 you'll find
0:14 them in the bottom right of your pivot
0:16 chart whenever you have more than one
0:17 field in the chart access area let's
0:20 take a look at some
0:22 examples here I have a pivot chart and
0:25 if you look at the field list you can
0:26 see there are three fields in the axis
0:29 well you years quarters and date which
0:32 actually represents the month now
0:34 currently the chart is only showing the
0:36 year and quarter level of detail but I
0:39 can drill up and down using these expand
0:42 and collapse buttons on the face of the
0:45 chart now in earlier versions of excel
0:48 you don't have these buttons but you can
0:50 double click on the axis to drill down
0:53 and to go back up you need to have the
0:56 axis selected and then right click
0:59 expand and collapse
1:00 here you can collapse one field at a
1:02 time so that would be the field that you
1:04 had selected when you right clicked so
1:06 you can see here Quarter Two has
1:09 collapsed or you can right click expand
1:12 and collapse collapse entire field so
1:16 there's a bit more work required in
1:18 earlier versions of excel because we
1:20 don't have these handy expand and
1:22 collapse buttons on the face of the
1:23 chart but the features are still there
1:26 now let's look at how we build a chart
1:28 with these expand and CLE
1:31 buttons to build a pivot chart with the
1:33 expand and collapse buttons simply
1:35 select the data or a cell in the data
1:38 range and then on the insert tab I'm
1:40 going to go straight to Pivot
1:42 chart you get the same dialogue box you
1:45 do for a pivot table so all I need to do
1:47 is choose where I want to place the
1:48 pivot chart and I'm going to put it on
1:51 this sheet so select the cell there and
1:53 click okay notice that we get a
1:56 placeholder for the pivot table and a
1:58 placeholder for the pivot chart
2:00 and if we look at the field list you can
2:02 see the field Wells have Legend and axis
2:05 categories instead of rows and column
2:07 labels we build it just like a pivot
2:10 table so we add the fields to the Chart
2:13 area that we want now notice at the
2:16 moment I only have one field in my Axis
2:19 categories and I don't have the expand
2:21 and collapse buttons but as soon as I
2:23 add product now I get the expand and
2:26 collapse buttons added now the charts a
2:30 bit small so let's make it a bit bigger
2:32 Now by default pivot charts have these
2:34 field buttons for the access labels the
2:36 legend if you have one and the values
2:39 personally I think these take up way too
2:41 much room especially in bar charts which
2:44 I'm going to turn this into but first I
2:46 want to turn these buttons off so you
2:49 can do it by right clicking and then
2:51 hide access field buttons on chart you
2:54 can hide all the field buttons on the
2:55 chart but I want the expand and collapse
2:57 buttons to remain so I need to turn
2:59 these access field buttons off by
3:02 themselves and then again for the valy
3:05 fields now you can also access those
3:08 fill button options on the paper chart
3:10 tab fill buttons and then you can see it
3:13 still has the report filter buttons on
3:16 the chart but we don't have any at the
3:18 moment there's no filters so I don't
3:20 need to turn that off and the legend
3:22 Fields I don't have any values in my
3:24 Legend so again I don't need to turn
3:27 that off but I can do it here you can
3:29 see there is the expand and collapse fi
3:32 buttons and they're showing in the
3:34 bottom right of the chart so let's turn
3:36 this into a bar chart on the design tab
3:40 I'm just going to change the chart type
3:42 bar chart is better suited to charts
3:44 with long labels in the axis so let's
3:48 resize
3:49 this and I'll do a little bit more
3:51 formatting we'll turn the title Off the
3:53 Grid lines and the legend and I'm just
3:56 going to select the bar and control one
3:59 to open the the formatting and we'll
4:01 make the Gap with
4:02 50% that just makes it a bit easier to
4:05 read so now that I have my chart you can
4:08 see I've got the expand and collapse
4:09 buttons I can
4:11 collapse and expand as I wish now
4:15 another feature that's not easily
4:17 discoverable is the ability to add a
4:18 field to the access using double click
4:21 for this I'm going to remove the product
4:23 field and you can see the expand and
4:25 claps buttons have gone now with the
4:27 axis selected if I double click one of
4:29 the access labels I get a dialogue Box
4:32 open up that allows me to add a field
4:35 from the existing field list so for
4:37 example here I could add the Year to my
4:40 access and it's being added to the
4:42 access categories in the field list and
4:45 you can see it's also added to the Chart
4:48 again the expand and collapse buttons
4:50 are available so I can rightclick to
4:55 collapse I can double click to expand or
4:58 I can use the expand and collapse
5:00 buttons depending on the version of
5:01 excel that you have now the only
5:04 downside of the drill down buttons or
5:06 expand and collapse buttons is that they
5:07 can only drill up and down on one chart
5:10 at a time I think it would be nice if
5:12 you could link them to other charts like
5:14 you can with slices and then you could
5:16 drill down multiple charts at the same
5:18 time well that's drilling down on the
5:21 face of the chart now all you need to do
5:23 is teach those who read your reports how
5:25 to use
5:27 them you can download the s far for this
5:30 lesson from the link here I hope you can
5:32 make use of this technique if you like
