0:00 there's a little known tool in Excel
0:02 2016 onward that automatically
0:04 calculates forecasts for you and puts
0:07 them in a nice chart like this it writes
0:09 the formulas and gives you options for
0:11 handling seasonality and confidence
0:13 intervals among other things let's take
0:16 a look I'll be using this Hawaii visitor
0:19 data to demonstrate it's important that
0:21 your data contains a column with dates
0:23 or times at consistent intervals and a
0:26 separate column containing the values
0:28 you can see here I've got a visit
0:30 account for the first day of each month
0:33 it's basically just monthly data to
0:35 insert a forecast chart select your data
0:38 or if it's in a contiguous range just a
0:41 sell in the table as mine is here and
0:44 then on the data tab of the ribbon over
0:45 on the far right we've got forecast
0:48 sheet this opens up the dialogue box
0:51 with a preview of the chart it's going
0:53 to insert at the top we can choose the
0:55 chart we've got line chart or column
0:57 chart I'm going to stick with line chart
0:59 for this example and the next setting is
1:02 when to end the forecast you can see
1:04 here it has forecast out 6 months in
1:07 advance clicking on options reveals more
1:10 settings the forecast start by default
1:13 will be the last day in your data set
1:15 you can start the forecast before the
1:17 last date and sometimes we use this for
1:19 seasonal data the confidence interval is
1:22 the range surrounding each predictive
1:24 value in this case in which 95% of
1:27 future points are expected to fall based
1:29 on the for
1:30 with normal distribution these are the
1:32 two final lines we see on either side of
1:35 the forecast line in the chart or if you
1:38 chose the column chart it's the error
1:40 bars that we can see on the last six
1:43 columns now the confidence interval can
1:45 help you get a feel for the accuracy of
1:47 the forecast a smaller interval implies
1:50 more confidence for the specific point
1:53 seasonality is a number for the length
1:55 or number of points of the seasonal
1:57 pattern and it's automatically detected
2:00 for example in a yearly sales cycle with
2:02 each point representing a month the
2:04 seasonality is 12 when the seasonality
2:06 isn't significant enough for the
2:08 algorithm to detect the prediction will
2:10 revert to a linear Trend you can
2:12 override the automatic detection by
2:14 choosing set manually and then you can
2:17 enter a number there for example here I
2:19 might choose three or four Cycles
2:22 because I've got tourism data just keep
2:24 in mind when setting seasonality
2:26 manually you should avoid a value of
2:28 less than two cycles of historical data
2:31 because with less than two cycles Excel
2:33 can't identify the seasonal components
2:36 next we can choose to include forast
2:38 statistics and here Excel will
2:40 automatically generate a table of
2:42 Statistics using the
2:44 forecast. dostat function including
2:47 measures for smoothing coefficients and
2:49 error
2:50 metrics Now by default the timeline
2:52 range includes all the dates in your
2:54 table but you can change that here just
2:57 keep in mind that the range must match
3:00 the values range which you can also
3:02 change here so you can see mine are both
3:05 the same size and I'll leave them as is
3:08 Excel uses interpolation to handle
3:10 missing points which means a missing
3:12 point will be completed as the weighted
3:14 average of its neighboring points where
3:16 fewer than 30% of the points are missing
3:18 if you prefer you can treat missing
3:21 points as zeros by selecting zeros from
3:23 the list here and lastly Excel will
3:26 average values that contain the same
3:28 date and time you can choose another
3:31 calculation method such as median if you
3:34 prefer all right let's click create and
3:37 take a look so you can see it's inserted
3:39 a new sheet in the file it's brought in
3:42 my data it's added in the forecast
3:45 function and the forecast. et. confin
3:48 function for the confidence intervals
3:51 you can edit these formulas and extend
3:53 them as required if you need to update
3:56 your data it's automatically going to
3:58 feed through to the chart because it's
4:00 linked to the table here now if you
4:02 chose to include the forecast statistics
4:05 in the options when you created the
4:07 forecast sheet you'll see them beside
4:09 the forecast table they all use the
4:12 forecast. ETS Dost function and you'll
4:15 notice that the third argument is simply
4:17 a different
4:19 number and that specifies the statistic
4:22 type to return now there's a link in the
4:24 video description if you'd like more
4:26 information on the different statistics
4:28 available here I won't go through each
4:30 one and bore you they can share Excel
4:32 workbooks containing forecast sheets and
4:34 charts with users who have earlier
4:36 versions of excel they'll see the table
4:38 and the chart I simply can't edit these
4:40 formulas because I don't have those
4:41 functions available in their version now
4:44 if you want to make changes to the
4:45 forecast then it's important to know
4:48 that the forecast sheet is not linked to
4:50 your original data you can see here all
4:52 these numbers are hard keyed so if you
4:55 make changes to your original data
4:57 you'll need to also make those changes
4:59 in in this sheet here if you add more
5:01 data to this table the chart will
5:03 automatically pick it up so you won't
5:05 need to edit that now one thing I like
5:07 to do with these charts is apply a
5:09 custom number format that wraps the
5:11 month and year onto separate lines so
5:14 with the dates selected I'm going to
5:15 control one to open the formatting
5:17 dialogue box and then down at custom in
5:20 here I'm going to enter my format which
5:23 is MM for month and then contrl J to
5:26 force a carriage return and then y y you
5:30 can't see the y y because it's wrapped
5:32 down onto the next line and this type
5:35 field isn't big enough I'll click okay
5:38 and you can see now the chart is
5:40 displaying the month and the year
5:42 wrapped onto separate lines It just fits
5:44 in much easier into the chart area I
5:47 could force that to display in the table
5:49 as well by setting the font to wrap and
5:52 then making the row bigger I'll leave it
5:55 as is and undo that I don't need it for
5:57 the purpose of this because my chart is
5:59 picking up up the wrapped effect of the
6:01 month and the year but I would like to
6:04 just insert a text box just beside the
6:08 axis that will allow me to put in a
6:11 label and I'll have to make the fonts
6:13 much
6:14 smaller and we'll just right align it
6:18 change the font to a shade of gray and
6:21 we'll get rid of the outline on the text
6:24 box we might just need to reposition it
6:26 slightly so I think that's just a nicer
6:29 way way to display the horizontal axis
6:32 making it easier to
6:34 read now if you don't have Excel 2016 or
6:38 later you can still create forecasts
6:41 manually using the earlier forecast
6:43 function as you can see here and you can
6:45 use confidence. Norm to calculate the
6:47 confidence intervals they aren't quite
6:50 as good as a new functions that use
6:51 exponential triple smoothing and you
6:54 can't factor in
6:57 seasonality I hope you found this
6:58 forecast to useful you can download the
