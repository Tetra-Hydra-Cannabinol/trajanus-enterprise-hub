0:00 the default Legends for line charts can
0:02 be awkward and timeconsuming to read
0:05 especially when you have two Series in
0:06 your chart in this video I'm going to
0:09 show you how to label the end of the
0:11 line and for that label to dynamically
0:13 update as your data
0:15 grows now the first trick here is that
0:18 we have two series for budget and actual
0:20 one for the line and one for the label
0:23 likewise there are the actual columns
0:25 line and label all of these series are
0:28 in the chart and we're exploiting the
0:31 fact that charts don't display hash na
0:33 errors therefore in columns E and F we
0:36 can use an F Formula that returns # na
0:39 where the current row isn't the last in
0:41 the table column that contains a value
0:44 we can see for Budget it's row 61 and
0:46 for actuals it's row 52 now in English
0:50 the formula says if cell c44 is blank
0:54 and cell 43 is not blank then this must
0:57 be the last row with data so return the
1:00 budget amount otherwise return the hash
1:02 and a error now at budget that you can
1:05 see here is a table structured reference
1:08 that references the budget column on the
1:10 row containing the formula now if we
1:12 look at column F you can see the formula
1:14 is the same the only difference is it's
1:16 referencing the actual column now all I
1:19 need to do is add labels in the chart
1:21 for these series here so select the
1:24 chart now It's tricky to select these
1:26 series because we can't see them easily
1:28 so I'm going to go up to the format Tab
1:30 and then in the drop down here I can
1:32 select the series that I want now I'm
1:34 going to add a data label but I want to
1:37 go into more options and here I want to
1:40 go to the label options and I want the
1:43 series name not the value and it's
1:45 defaulted to the label position of right
1:48 so you can see our label's there in
1:50 order to give the label more room I'm
1:51 just going to move the plot area to the
1:53 left slightly a nice touch is to also
1:56 color code the label the same as the
1:58 line so let's do that going into text
2:00 options and here I'm going to choose the
2:02 same color as the line which is this one
2:05 now what you might find is that it
2:07 appears lighter than the line that's
2:09 just cuz the font is not as thick as the
2:12 line so we can go one shade darker just
2:14 to help its readability now all I need
2:17 to do is repeat that process for the
2:19 actual so on the format tab let's select
2:22 the series we're going to add a data
2:27 label with more
2:28 options we want to have the series name
2:31 we don't want the value we don't want
2:32 leader lines and it's correctly
2:34 positioned right let's go ahead and
2:36 format the font color so that it is the
2:39 same as the line and we'll go one shade
2:41 darker for this one as well now when I
2:45 enter a new value for my actuals that's
2:47 enter 380 you'll see the line and the
2:50 label moves along nice huh now one of
2:53 the limitations of this technique is
2:55 when the lines end in a position that's
2:57 close together and the labels end up
2:59 overlapping unfortunately there's not
3:02 really an easy way to handle this when
3:03 you have lots of lines with just two
3:05 lines like we have here you could always
3:08 modify your IF function to test whether
3:10 this value is close to the actual or
3:13 vice versa and then you could add a
3:15 buffer value to that data point which
3:18 would automatically move that label
3:20 above or below where it would have
3:22 normally finished alternatively you can
3:25 always move the labels just left click
3:28 and drag and manually move them into
3:30 place obviously that's not ideal but if
3:33 you've got lots of series and they just
3:34 happen to end in the same place that
3:36 might be your best solution hopefully
3:38 Microsoft will improve the chart
3:40 labeling experience in future releases
3:42 we have been hounding them to do this
3:44 for quite some time now you can download
3:47 the Excel file for this lesson from the
3:48 link here a big thank you to fellow EXL
3:51 MVP John paltier who showed me this
3:54 technique I hope you can make use of it
3:56 and if you like this video please give
3:58 it a thumbs up and subscribe to my
4:00 channel for more and why not share it
4:02 with your friends who might also find it
