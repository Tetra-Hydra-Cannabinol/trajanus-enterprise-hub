0:00 multicolored line charts are a little
0:02 gimmicky after all we don't need color
0:04 to tell if a line is going up or down
0:07 however it can be useful for encoding
0:09 data that's outside of a threshold and
0:11 can also speed up interpretation
0:14 especially if you use the familiar
0:15 traffic light encoding we have a few
0:18 different approaches available for
0:19 creating multicolored line charts so
0:21 let's take a
0:23 look I'm using some load data for a
0:26 computer CPU taken at half hour
0:28 intervals now the first first chart
0:30 formats the line in a gradient fill and
0:32 this is the simplest because it only
0:34 requires one Series so let's insert our
0:38 chart it's just a line chart and then we
0:41 need to Simply format the line so I'm
0:43 going to control one to open the format
0:45 data series I need the Paint Bucket icon
0:49 and here we want to choose gradient line
0:51 and all I need to do is format the
0:53 colors for these gradient stops so the
0:55 first one's selected and here I want
0:57 this one to be red the next next one I
1:00 need to move it down in fact I wanted
1:02 about
1:03 34% and let's format the color for this
1:06 one in
1:08 yellow this one I don't need so I'm
1:10 going to delete
1:12 it and the last one is going to be green
1:16 so you can see now our line is formatted
1:18 I want to change the axis maximum to 100
1:22 we can't have more than 100% CPU now the
1:25 limitation with the gradient is that
1:27 it's based on percentages as opposed to
1:29 Absolute values and that means you can't
1:31 format values above or below a threshold
1:34 with a specific color this can make
1:36 updating the gradient stops for new data
1:39 a potentially manual task it really
1:41 depends if you plan to update your chart
1:43 with new data on as to how userfriendly
1:45 this method will
1:48 be the second option is to use multiple
1:51 Series this requires the source data to
1:53 be set up with each Series in its own
1:56 column and you can see them here I've
1:57 got one for orange yellow and green
2:00 now for ease of calculation you can see
2:02 I've got if formulas in each column each
2:05 one is slightly different but for ease
2:07 of calculation the green series plots
2:10 every value but the green series line is
2:13 covered up by the yellow and orange
2:15 series were appropriate and you'll see
2:17 that in a moment so let's insert the
2:19 chart insert another line chart so it
2:23 looks like we only have one series here
2:24 let me make the chart a bit bigger if I
2:26 right click on the chart we're going to
2:28 select data
2:30 now the first thing I want to do is
2:31 delete the CPU load series I don't
2:33 actually need it in the chart it's just
2:35 in the table for the purpose of the
2:36 calculation for the other series the
2:39 next thing I need to do is rearrange the
2:41 order of the remaining series because
2:44 you can see in the chart that the whole
2:46 line is yellow and that's because the
2:48 green series which is currently
2:49 formatted yellow we haven't changed it
2:51 yet is sitting on the bottom so let me
2:54 move that to the top and then we'll move
2:56 this one up one as well and now you can
2:58 see if we look behind behind we have
3:00 three distinct colors for our lines one
3:03 for each Series so I click okay there
3:06 now all I need to do is format the color
3:08 of those lines so control one to open
3:10 the format pane we're going to go to the
3:12 line here and we're going to make this
3:14 one
3:16 green and I'll select the next one this
3:19 one's going to be yellow and the last
3:22 one is orange now I don't need this
3:25 Legend so I'm just going to select it
3:26 and press delete we'll format the axess
3:30 again so that the maximum is
3:33 100 and our chart is
3:35 done now the key here let me close this
3:39 down and move the chart across is that
3:41 these series overlap so you can see 85
3:44 there is also present in the green
3:46 series now if I were to delete the 85 in
3:49 the green series we'll end up with a gap
3:51 here and that's why you need to make
3:53 sure that they overlap so I can contrl Z
3:56 to undo that now strictly speaking I
3:59 don't need all of these values because
4:02 they're covered by the line so I could
4:04 delete them the line Remains the Same
4:07 but like I said I've used formulas to
4:09 populate the values for each series and
4:12 it's just easier to leave those ones in
4:15 so that is the multicolor line chart
4:17 where we've Ed three series one for each
4:19 color A variation on this chart is to
4:22 create a column chart so I'm going to
4:24 control D to duplicate that chart and
4:27 I'll just place it over the top CU I
4:30 don't have a lot of space so let's
4:31 modify the format of this chart we'll
4:33 change the chart type to a column chart
4:37 and I'll click okay now we need to do
4:39 some formatting because right now it
4:41 looks a bit of a mess so contrl 1 and
4:44 here I
4:45 want my series to be 100% overlapped And
4:50 I'm going to change the Gap width to 30
4:52 just because having narrow columns hurts
4:54 my eyes so now all I need to do is
4:57 format the colors of those columns so so
4:59 contrl one again we'll go into the Paint
5:01 Bucket so the first one should be green
5:05 and we want the border to be no
5:08 line now just to be clear on which
5:11 series I'm selecting I'm going to go to
5:13 the format tab I'm going to select it
5:15 here so this one's the yellow series now
5:18 I can change that to Yellow fill and
5:21 we'll have no line on that as well and
5:23 the last series is orange anyway so
5:26 there you have a variation on the
5:29 gradient fills in the line chart instead
5:31 we've got a column chart with column
5:33 charts we can easily determine Trends in
5:36 our data because the top of the columns
5:39 acts a bit like a line so it really just
5:41 depends on your preference whether you
5:42 use the line chart or the column chart
5:46 okay let's take a look at the last
5:49 option this one uses a stacked area
5:52 chart for the threshold bands and you'll
5:54 notice here in the table that we've got
5:56 three thresholds green yellow and orange
5:59 now you'll notice that the value for the
6:01 thresholds is the same all the way down
6:04 the columns the green threshold is
6:06 anything below 80 the yellow threshold
6:09 is anything between 80 and 90 remember
6:11 it's a stacked chart so we're adding
6:13 these values together so that will give
6:15 us 90 and then finally the orange
6:18 threshold is anything between 90 and 100
6:22 so let's insert our chart we want a
6:24 stacked error chart so this one here now
6:27 we need to change this blue series to a
6:31 line chart so I'm going to right click
6:33 change series chart type and here's my
6:36 CPU load I want that to be a line and
6:39 you can see automatically my stacked
6:42 values look more like thresholds so I'll
6:45 click okay now all I need to do is
6:48 format them so again control one to open
6:50 the format
6:52 dialogue here I want my line color to be
6:55 white and then all I need to do is
6:57 format the threshold so this one's
7:01 green this one is yellow and I'm just
7:05 choosing pastel kind of variations of
7:08 the colors so that it's not too bright
7:11 and gishen in your face and lastly let's
7:14 make this
7:16 100 we don't need the
7:18 legend we can always link the chart
7:21 title to this cell
7:23 here the last thing I want to do is get
7:26 rid of the grid lines you can only just
7:27 see them behind so we'll deselect those
7:30 and it just looks a bit
7:32 neater I hope you can make use of this
7:35 technique but don't get carried away
7:36 using gradient fills multicolored lines
7:39 and columns Etc please only use them
7:42 where they aid interpretation otherwise
7:45 they fall into the chart junk category
7:47 where at best they can make you look
7:49 unprofessional and at worst they make it
7:52 difficult for your audience to interpret
7:53 the chart so go ahead and download the
