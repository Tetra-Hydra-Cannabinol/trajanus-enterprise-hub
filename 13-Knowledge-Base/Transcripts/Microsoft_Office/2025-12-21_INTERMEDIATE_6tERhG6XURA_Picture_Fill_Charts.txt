0:00 when building reports it's important
0:02 that people not only understand what
0:04 you're saying but also remember it
0:07 picture fill charts are a simple way to
0:09 make your data visualizations more
0:11 captivating and memorable you can create
0:14 them with column charts or area charts
0:16 let's take a look this technique is easy
0:19 to do with area charts but column charts
0:22 require a bit more wrangling the trick
0:24 is to use a stacked column chart the
0:27 image is placed in the plot area and the
0:30 top series hides the image above the
0:32 main series that we can see on the
0:34 bottom the data table here contains the
0:37 year and member numbers that I want to
0:39 visualize the helper column contains the
0:42 dummy series which is calculated by
0:44 adding 20% to the maximum of the members
0:48 column minus the current row member
0:51 number this way the total of the two
0:53 colums is the same for every year and
0:57 that makes the height of our columns
0:58 equal I'm just going to delete that
1:01 let's select the data and then on the
1:04 insert tab going to insert a stacked
1:09 column let's just bring it up here
1:11 closer to the data and I'll make it a
1:13 bit bigger the first thing is the year
1:16 has been interpreted as a series rather
1:18 than the access labels let's right click
1:21 and select data to fix
1:24 it so here with year selected I'm just
1:27 going to remove it and then I want to
1:29 edit the horizontal or category access
1:31 labels and here I'm going to select the
1:34 year
1:36 values and that fix those two issues
1:39 next I want to set the Gap width on the
1:42 columns so that there's zero Gap width
1:44 so control one to open the formatting
1:46 Pane and let me just drag it over from
1:48 the dock so it's closer to the Chart so
1:51 we want the Gap width to be
1:53 zero and then I'm just going to turn off
1:57 the chart title grid lines and L
2:00 you can add a title to your chart if you
2:02 want I'm going to leave it out for the
2:04 purpose of this
2:05 example next I want to fill the helper
2:08 series with the same color as my chart
2:10 fill so if your chart has a specific
2:13 fill color then you'd match this top
2:15 series to that mine is white so we're
2:18 just going to format them in white and
2:21 then the bottom columns I'm going to set
2:24 the fill color to no fill so that when I
2:26 put my image in we can see it through
2:28 the columns now the chart appears empty
2:31 but don't worry it is all there next we
2:34 need to choose a picture to use but keep
2:36 in mind that if the picture has a lot
2:38 going on the reader will be too busy
2:40 looking at the nice picture instead of
2:42 reading and interpreting your chart for
2:45 example I find this one distracting
2:47 because the light parts of the image
2:49 above the Horizon are quite different to
2:51 the Lavender Fields below so instead of
2:53 drawing your eye to the top of the
2:55 columns as it should your eye is drawn
2:57 to the image now I'm going to to use a
3:00 Microsoft stock image that I can get by
3:02 the insert tab pictures stock images and
3:07 these come free with Microsoft 365 if
3:09 you don't have Microsoft 365 then you
3:11 can get an image from iock photo or a
3:14 similar image sharing service I want to
3:17 find a picture of a
3:19 meadow and I want this one here so we'll
3:22 insert that now it is a bit
3:26 busy and a bit too colorful so I'm going
3:28 to use the picture formatting tools
3:30 available on the picture format Tab and
3:33 then I'm going to recolor it and I could
3:35 use one of these defaults but I'm going
3:38 to go in and set my own color and
3:41 there's one here that I used earlier so
3:43 I'm just going to go with this lavender
3:46 color now with my picture ready I'm
3:48 going to copy it to the clipboard and
3:49 I'll just move it down here out of the
3:51 way now you might be tempted to select
3:54 the columns and then go into the fill
3:57 and picture or Texture fill and then
4:00 copy it from my clipboard but what
4:02 happens is it squishes the whole image
4:05 into each column and it looks terrible
4:08 so we don't want that I'm going to
4:10 contrl Z to undo that instead what I
4:13 want is the plot area and it's a bit
4:16 tricky to select sometimes so I'm just
4:18 going to click the drop down select it
4:20 from the list here and then under fill I
4:23 want picture or Texture it's already
4:26 copied to my clipboard if you haven't
4:28 copied a picture to your clipboard you
4:30 can insert it and you can browse to your
4:33 computer or a local network the stock
4:35 images which is where I got my picture
4:37 from online pictures or even
4:41 icons I've got it already on my
4:43 clipboard so I'm just going to click
4:45 clipboard and my image is sitting in the
4:48 plot area behind my column so there's my
4:50 top series and my bottom series now I
4:53 need to hide this section at the top so
4:55 I'm going to adjust my vertical axis so
4:58 that it stops at 2,000 instead of 2 and
5:01 1/2 th000 and that way it's sitting
5:04 behind the columns now I need to make
5:07 these look more like columns at the
5:09 moment it's just one Big Blob so with
5:11 them selected I'm going to format the
5:14 outline in white and we just need to
5:18 make it thicker so we'll give it this 4
5:19 and 1/2 point and now we have a column
5:22 chart with an image that spans all of
5:25 the columns now I'd like to add labels
5:28 to this chart but the labels won't stand
5:30 out on the top of this picture and
5:32 because it's a stacked column chart I
5:34 can't set the labels to sit above the
5:36 columns what I can do is I can borrow
5:39 these columns and put my labels in there
5:42 so let's go and do that data labels more
5:46 options and then in here I want no lader
5:50 lines I don't want the value for the
5:52 helper column I want to choose value
5:55 from these cells which is the value for
5:58 the bottom columns
6:00 click okay there they are let's sit them
6:03 inside the base so they're currently
6:06 sitting inside the base of the helper
6:08 columns which is also above my main
6:11 series now that I've got the columns
6:14 labeled I don't also need to see this
6:16 vertical axis so let's go down and set
6:19 the label position to none we also need
6:23 to go in and put no fill for this line
6:28 here otherwise it will show Shar and
6:30 there you have a column chart with an
6:32 image fill that spans the chart just
6:35 keep in mind that we've fixed the
6:37 maximum height for the vertical axis so
6:39 if these values change you may need to
6:42 alter that
6:43 axis area charts can also have a picture
6:47 fill and it's much easier to set up here
6:49 I've got Microsoft share prices for the
6:51 past year now I don't need a helper
6:53 column for this data so I can just go
6:55 ahead and insert a regular
6:58 chart
7:00 so we want an area
7:02 chart let's bring it over here and I'll
7:04 make it a bit bigger to apply the
7:07 picture simply select the area and then
7:10 on the fill picture or Texture it's
7:13 remember the one from my clipboard I'm
7:15 going to choose a different one so let's
7:17 go and find a stock image and we'll
7:20 search for images related to
7:23 computer now it's important that the
7:25 image you choose won't be too affected
7:28 if it's distorted cuz it will be
7:29 compressed to fit the dimensions of the
7:31 chart I'm going to choose this one here
7:34 it's a bit
7:35 abstract and there you go now if you
7:38 want to give the area a bit more
7:40 definition you can add the price series
7:42 again before I do that I'm just going to
7:45 go and remove the title and the grid
7:47 lines and then I'm just going to select
7:50 all the prices again copied them to my
7:53 clipboard click on the chart crl V to
7:56 paste now I want to change the series
7:59 time type here so in the chart design
8:01 change chart type this one I want to be
8:05 a
8:05 line and click okay so we can leave it
8:09 Orange it's a bit in your face so let's
8:12 tone that down we'll make it a solid
8:15 line and we might set it to this bright
8:17 blue color and I'll just make the line a
8:20 bit thinner that just makes the ulations
8:23 easier to
8:24 see I hope you found this tutorial
8:27 useful keep in mind that picture filter
8:29 charts are suitable for infographics and
8:31 fun reports but I wouldn't necessarily
8:34 use them in corporate style reports okay
