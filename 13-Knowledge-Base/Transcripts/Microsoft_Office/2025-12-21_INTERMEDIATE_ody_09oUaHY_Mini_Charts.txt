0:01 many charts are a great alternative to
0:04 spark lines they're just regular charts
0:06 made really really small you might
0:08 consider using them instead of spark
0:10 lines when you want something other than
0:12 column line or win loss charts for
0:15 example maybe you want to see two Series
0:17 in your mini chart like this actual and
0:19 budget data let's take a look at how to
0:21 create a mini
0:23 chart here's my data now I want to
0:26 insert an area chart that's going to
0:28 show the trend of these values over time
0:31 so all I need to do is select the actual
0:33 values I'm not going to display the
0:36 access labels or a legend so I don't
0:38 need to worry about the labels for the
0:39 columns and the rows then insert and we
0:43 want the area chart 2D so next I need to
0:47 strip the chart down so it just shows
0:50 the area I don't need the axis the chart
0:53 title or the grid lines the next thing I
0:57 want to do is get rid of the border on
0:59 the chart if I click off you can see
1:01 there's a faint border so let's go up
1:03 and format it and we'll set the shape
1:06 outline to no
1:07 outline next I'm going to resize the
1:10 plot area so that it fills the entire
1:14 chart area CU we need these charts to be
1:17 as big as possible when they're in the
1:19 cell so I've created my chart now all I
1:22 need to do is position it so with the
1:25 outside of the chart selected I'm going
1:26 to hold down the ALT key and that will
1:29 just snap it to the grid so I'm going to
1:31 place it in column o and then still
1:33 holding down alt I'm just going to
1:36 resize it to fill the cell so now that
1:39 I've created one all I need to do is
1:41 rinse and repeat so let's contrl D to
1:44 duplicate the chart and we need seven of
1:47 them so we'll do it six more
1:49 times let's just position them I'm going
1:52 to grab this one and position it down in
1:54 the bottom
1:55 cell and then I'm going to select each
1:59 of the other charts I'm holding down
2:00 shift while I select them and let's just
2:03 format them so that they're all aligned
2:05 to the left and then we're going to
2:07 distribute them vertically so now we
2:10 have our charts one in each cell but at
2:12 the moment they're all picking up this
2:14 line of data so let's just adjust them
2:18 just left clicking and dragging to
2:20 move the series cells down to the
2:23 relevant
2:28 row okay so now we have a mini chart in
2:31 each cell and because they're aligned to
2:34 the cell size if I increase the width of
2:37 the column you can see that the chart
2:40 resizes in line with the column width
2:42 and likewise I can change the row height
2:45 and the chart will resize as well let's
2:48 just undo that now one thing to be aware
2:50 of is that each mini chart has its own
2:52 vertical axis Scale based on the values
2:55 in the series so if we look at row seven
2:57 you can see that all the values are less
2:59 than 20
3:00 but most of the values in row eight are
3:02 closer to 200 however this isn't obvious
3:05 from the mini charts now having the
3:07 vertical axes on different scales makes
3:09 it difficult to compare the charts to
3:11 one another so if this is something that
3:13 you want to do your best to use a ghost
3:16 series to force the vertical axis scale
3:19 to be uniform across all of the charts
3:22 now the ghost series contains a single
3:24 value that's the maximum value in your
3:27 data set so if we look at our data set
3:30 you can see that the maximum value is
3:32 200 which is there so your ghost series
3:35 value will be 200 and this is going to
3:37 force all of the charts to have the same
3:39 vertical axis scale you then set the
3:42 color for the ghost series to no fill so
3:44 it's not visible in the chart now
3:45 there's a link in the video description
3:47 to a post on how to insert ghost series
3:49 if you're interested in that so that's
3:52 an area chart with a single value it's
3:54 similar to spark lines except spark line
3:57 don't have an area option but let's look
4:00 at another option where we have two
4:02 Series so here I have some actual data
4:06 and budget data and I want to show the
4:08 actuals as an area chart and the budget
4:11 as a line chart so I'm just going to
4:13 start by inserting an area chart for my
4:18 actuals and then I want to add a series
4:21 for the budget so I'm going to copy this
4:23 data and then on the Home tab we're
4:26 going to paste special and want a new
4:30 series the values are in the row and
4:33 we'll click okay so now we have our two
4:36 Series this is my budget and this is my
4:38 actual so what I want to do is change
4:41 the chart type for the budget so I'm
4:42 going to right click change series chart
4:45 type and then here I want this to be a
4:48 line chart and I'll click okay now we
4:51 can go about formatting this as we want
4:54 so let's get rid of the chart title and
4:57 the grid lines and the
5:00 axes the next thing I want to do is
5:02 apply the formatting now it's easier to
5:04 do the formatting while the chart is Big
5:06 so control one to open the format pane
5:09 so let's set this
5:12 to a gray color and we'll make it much
5:15 thinner because when we make the chart
5:17 smaller it's going to look much thicker
5:20 and let's change the color we'll make it
5:22 paler shade of green okay now that our
5:25 chart's looking how we want let's make
5:27 the plot area the same size as the chart
5:32 area and now all I need to do is select
5:36 the chart using alt move it into place
5:39 I've just noticed it still has the
5:41 border so let's remove the border so
5:43 we're going to go shape outline no
5:45 outline okay and I'm going to close this
5:49 pane so I can reach my pull handles
5:52 holding down alt and resizing it so
5:56 there's our mini chart that contains our
5:58 budget and actual now I'm just going to
6:01 duplicate it seven times so contrl
6:05 D let's move this one down holding down
6:09 alt and then shift while I select the
6:11 other charts now I could use contr a to
6:15 select all objects but I have other
6:18 charts on this sheet so I don't want to
6:20 do that so we're just going to use shift
6:22 we're going to Aline them left and then
6:25 distribute vertically now all we need to
6:27 do is select the series so I need to
6:30 move this one down and likewise so while
6:34 I do this I'm just going to fast forward
6:36 so that you don't have to watch me rinse
6:38 and repeat so now each chart is picking
6:41 up the correct data but you'll notice
6:43 the formatting is all messed up so when
6:44 I chose the new series range it reverted
6:47 to the default formatting so what I want
6:50 to do is copy the formatting from this
6:52 chart and paste it onto the others so
6:54 with the chart selected crl C then I'm
6:57 going to select the next chart
7:00 and then on the Home tab we're going to
7:01 go paste special and down here in the
7:04 dialogue box I'm choosing formats so
7:07 I'll click okay and like magic it
7:09 updates now a quicker way to do that is
7:12 just to select the next chart and press
7:15 F4 once we've done the past special once
7:17 we can just rinse and repeat with the F4
7:21 key and then we have our Excel mini
7:25 charts plotting actual and budget data
7:28 and again the vertical axis on each of
7:30 these is specific to the data set so if
7:33 you want all of the vertical axes to be
7:35 the same you'll need to use another
7:37 ghost
7:38 series and lastly I want to show you how
7:41 to plot a bar chart for this data here
7:45 so I want to plot the variance data so
7:47 I'm just going to select it this is the
7:49 variance so I'm going to
7:51 insert a bar
7:53 chart now I need to format the vertical
7:56 axis so with it selected control one to
7:58 open the format map Pane and here I
8:01 first of all need to set the categories
8:03 in reverse order and if I add the data
8:05 labels you'll see what what I mean you
8:08 can see here the first value is 18 which
8:10 is the last and here the last value is
8:12 22 which is the first so we need to set
8:15 the categories in reverse order so that
8:17 our chart bars are in the correct
8:20 order now I want to hide the vertical
8:23 axis but I don't want to delete it I
8:25 just want to hide the tick marks so
8:28 let's go down and they're set To None
8:30 already that's fine let's turn the
8:33 labels to
8:34 none and I want to format the vertical
8:38 line so that it's a slightly darker
8:42 gray and a bit thicker and you'll see
8:45 why when I make the chart smaller so now
8:48 that we've hidden that let's turn off
8:50 the horizontal axis we'll get rid of the
8:53 chart title and the grid lines let's
8:55 format this negative Series in a
8:58 different color so with it's selected I
9:00 can invert if negative so we're going to
9:03 go green for the positive and red for
9:07 negative now with the chart selected
9:09 let's hide the outline so I'm just going
9:11 to click this again CU it's already set
9:13 to no fill or no outline and let's
9:17 resize the plot area to fill the chart
9:21 space and before I make the chart
9:24 smaller I'm just going to set the Gap
9:27 width to 30 cuz this will make the bars
9:30 a bit bigger which will be helpful when
9:31 I make the chart really small so with
9:34 the outer edge of the chart selected I'm
9:36 holding down alt to snap it to the grid
9:40 and holding down alt while I resize it
9:43 so now that I have my variance chart I
9:45 don't necessarily need this column CU
9:47 I've got the values here so I'm just
9:49 going to make this column really narrow
9:51 if I hide it then I have to change the
9:53 settings on the chart to display hidden
9:55 columns so I'm just going to make it
9:57 much smaller and that'll just save me a
9:58 few steps so there you have mini Excel
10:03 charts they enable us to do a bit more
10:05 than we can with the spark line options
10:08 of line column and win loss so I hope
10:11 you find them useful take a moment to
