### Result
"Don't forget to like and subscribe. Welcome to Microsoft\nPowerPoint introduction. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. Let's take a look at what we'll\nbe covering today for this very popular presentation application. We'll navigate the PowerPoint interface. We'll learn how to design presentations. Big part of PowerPoint is being\nable to insert and format text. We'll also insert and format images. We'll take it a step further. We'll work with objects such as\ntext boxes, shapes, charts, tables. And we'll actually\ninsert and manage tables. Charts. And then we'll take a look at some\nof the animation and transition features just to make your presentation\nmore dynamic and responsive. Go ahead and open up Microsoft\nPowerPoint and we'll dive right in looking to support our\nchannel and get a great deal.

Looking for even more? Gain access to exams, certificates, and\nexclusive content at learnitanytime. com. More information can be found\nin the video description below. I'm going to go ahead and open up PowerPoint. Depending on the operating system that\nyou use, just locate your app launcher and go ahead and open up PowerPoint. When you open PowerPoint\nfor the first time, you're presented with the start screen. And on the start screen, we'll Realize\nwe have three big buttons here. One says Home, one says\nNew, and one says Open. And the main thing with these three\nbuttons, they all allow you to pretty much do a couple of different things here. You can find files that you have created. You can open files that you\nhave created or open a template. You can also go ahead and\ncreate a presentation as well. Right now I'm on the Home tab, and the\nHome tab shows me I can see all of my recent presentations that I've created. If I click on the new tab here, this\ngives me the chance to do something like create a new blank presentation. Or, I can go ahead and\nstart from a template. So there's a lot of templates\nhere that are already made for us. This is a really good start if you want\na really good starting point to create a really professional looking document. These were created by professionals. They already have the\nslides inserted for you. You just need to go ahead and\nadd your own content to these different ones here as well. I'll scroll down and we'll just\nquickly take a brief look at one here. So this one is for a sales pitch. So we can see a little preview,\nat least one of the slides. And over here on the right, we get a brief\ndescription of what this actually offers. If I wanted to go ahead and open this\nup, I can go ahead and click on create. I will click on create here\nand I'll take a look at this. So this downloads the file for you. And we can see over\nhere on the sales pitch, Slide pane, we have 21 slides. So this is the first slide. This is the title slide. We can see that we have a\nbackground image in here. We have a few text boxes\nor content placeholders. And let's just preview this. So pretty nice placement of the\ntext and the shapes and the images. So very nice, very organized. Very simple to read. Now, one thing that you'll realize\nis the modern presentations, they resemble web interfaces. So a lot of the shapes and a lot\nof the colors that we'll see, they resemble web pages as well. This one uses a lot of white\nspace, which is perfectly fine. If you can find a good way to balance\nthat, that works well here as well. So basically all of this information\nhere, here is a table, so we can plug our own information in here if we want to. Let's save this to 75, 000. We can go ahead and do that. And then once we're done,\nwe can go ahead and save it. Well, I'm going to go\nahead and run this here. So let's run the presentation. We'll talk about this in just a little\nbit, but down here on the taskbar, we have this little icon here. This will allow us to run the\npresentation or run the slideshow. Here's my slideshow. I can use the arrow keys\nto go to the next slide. I can press back to go to the first slide. I can even press up and down. So whichever way you want to navigate,\nyou can also click on the slide. That brings you from\none slide to the next. Down here on the bottom left, you'd\nsee it's a little faded here, but we have some more controls here. We can go back, we can go forward,\nand we'll cover some of these other advanced features here\nin just a little bit as well. So go ahead and open up\nyour version of PowerPoint. Once you're on the start screen,\njust click on new, and go ahead and search for a presentation. Go ahead and download it. And just preview it and come right back. Now that we've viewed a fully\nfunctional template, let's go ahead and create a new blank presentation. So right here, I'm still\non my start screen. From the home tab, I can go ahead\nand click on blank presentation. I can also get there\nfrom the new tab as well. Let's go ahead and create\na new blank presentation. Here is my blank presentation. Let's take a look at some of\nthe different components here. Here we can see all of our slides. Right now we have one slide. As we add slides we'll\nsee them appear here. We can see that we have our first slide. So this is actually a title slide. It's telling us to add a title and to\ngo ahead and add a subtitle as well. So this slide is a pre made slide. It has its own formatting and its\nown orientation in here as well. If you take a look at the\nbottom, you'll notice that we have, so this is our status bar. Down here we can do things like\nchange the different views. Right now we're using the normal view. If we wanted to take a look at the\nreading view, here's the reading view. If we wanted to run the presentation\nin full screen mode, here is our presentation view here as well. We can also zoom in or out. Notice right now I'm currently at 89%. So depending on your monitor\nsize and or resolution, You may notice a different size here. If I want to go ahead and make this a\nlittle bigger, if I click on the plus sign here, I can see it's making it bigger. If I click on the minus\nsign, it goes back down. But if I wanted to fit perfectly\nbased on my current settings, I'll click on this auto fit here, and\nthis will automatically fit it so I don't have to scroll up or sideways. So I'll click here, fit\nslide to current window. And it's telling me that based on my\ncurrent settings, 89%, I'm good to go. We'll work with these areas\nin just a little bit here. Right now, here's our\nbest friend, the ribbon. This is where we find all of our commands\nthat we can use, such as inserting a new slide, such as changing the font. Once we start entering text, changing\nthe paragraph options here as well. If we click on the Insert tab, we expect\nto find things that we can insert such as a table or pictures or shapes or charts\nor text boxes and various types of media. We're going to be inserting a lot\nof things here into our PowerPoint before this course is over. If we click on the Design\ntab, we'll notice that we have different themes that we can And if you just kind of mouse over\nthem, we can see the preview of what our presentation would look like,\nat least the title slide as well. So that's the ribbon. The other part that we have\nhere is the search box. Now the search box is pretty cool. It does more than just\nallows us to search things. We can get a quick tutorial. We can search for phrases in our document. Let's say I forgot how to zoom. I'll go ahead and type\nthe phrase zoom in here. And this is the way that search box works. It gives us different pieces of\ninformation or opportunities. So the very first tier here, we have\nseveral actions that we can use. So I can use the fit to window command,\nthe same thing that I did down here. I can go ahead and zoom to a particular\nUm, level, and then we have find in slide. So I can go ahead and search for\nthe phrase zoom in my presentation. But then down here is\nwhere it's really cool. We can get help. So maybe I forgot how to zoom in or out\nof a document down here on the bottom. I can get a quick tutorial. So let's go ahead and take a look at that. I'll type zoom in here\nand clear my annotations. I'll click on zoom in\nor out of a document. And just like that, it opens up a\nside pane over here for me, and it gives me a quick one two in terms\nof how to zoom in to my document. Notice it's pointing me to my zoom bar\nhere on my status bar, telling me I can either slide this or I can go ahead\nand click on the minus or click on the plus to zoom in or out here as well. If I want to be more specific, I can\nchoose a particular Zoom setting. So if I click here, this expands\nthe article further for me. So this is good. I don't need to go ahead and search the\ninternet for an answer on how to Zoom. Right here, I can go ahead and,\nand learn right here as well. If I want to expand the article, I can\nclick on this link, and this will open up the article in a browser for me. I'll go ahead and close this here. And we're good to go. So go ahead and navigate the interface. Go ahead and take a\nlook at the search bar. Go ahead and click on the different\nribbon tabs here to see what we can do. See what commands are available. Go ahead and zoom in or\nout of your document. The last thing we can talk about\nhere is, right here we have the ribbon display options. Right now I can see my full ribbon. If I click on this drop down here, I\nhave a couple of different options. I can go to full screen mode. If I want to just see the tabs, So\nI'll just see the tabs, but I don't see any of this information down here. I can show tabs only. So if I click here, so notice I'm only seeing tabs. Now, why would you, why\nwould you want to do this? Well, this gives me a little more room. Now I can see more of my slide. And if you'd notice when I switched to\ntabs only, Now I can utilize more space. I'm at 98 percent as well. If I still need to access a\ncommand, for example, if I wanted to insert something, it does. It's on demand now. So it shows me the full,\nthe root, the ribbon here. And if I click away, it goes back. Now it's your choice. You can either show the tabs or\nonce you click back here again, You'll notice that the ribbon\ndisplay options will appear again. We can also press Ctrl plus F1\nto collapse or expand the ribbon. I'll go back to always show ribbon. And I'm good to go. So go ahead and tour the\ninterface and come right back. Now that we've toured the interface, let's\ngo ahead and focus on our slide here. Let's break this slide down. So as we can see, we\nhave one slide in here. Let's go ahead and add another slide. So this is the title slide. So from the home tab, I can click\non the new slide drop down here. If I click on this arrow, this\nwill show me the different types of slides that I can insert. So if I click here, I can see\nI have a few to choose from. I actually have nine different types\nof slides that I can choose from. So right now, here's our title slide. Here we have title and content. We have a section header. We have two content. Comparison. Title only. So just a title with a blank slide. We have a blank slide. Caption on the left. Content on the right. And we have a picture\nwith caption here as well. I'm going to insert a title and content. And let's go ahead and\ncompare those two slides. So now I have two, because I did insert. So here's my title slide. And then down here, here\nis my title and content. Let's take a look at the title slide here. Now on the title slide, we'll\nnotice that we have two what's called content placeholders. So this is a title content placeholder. And on the bottom, this is a\nsubtitle content placeholder. So they're pre made. They have their own\nspecial formatting in here. So for example, if I were to click inside\nof the title content placeholder, we can see that it's using the font size of 60. Well, let's click on the subtitle content\nplaceholder and let's see what that is. So that is 24. So these are already predefined here. Now, we'll notice once we choose\na design theme, some of these options will change as well. But for now, we have on this slide,\nwe have a title placeholder and we have a subtitle placeholder. Let's take a look at slide number two. So here's slide number two. We can see that we have\na title placeholder. And down here we have what's\ncalled a content placeholder. This is called a content placeholder\nbecause there's various types of content that we can insert. So we can insert a image either\nfrom online or from our device. We can insert icons,\ntables, charts, video. So a lot of different things\nthat we can insert here. We can also add text. So if I just click in here, I have\nnow activated this, this content placeholder and I can type in here. Go ahead and do that. So for this particular content\nplaceholder, the default font size is 28. Let's click on the title here. Now notice the title placeholder for\nthis slide, it's not 60 like the title. This is 44, right? So the title slide is\nmeant to really stand out. So we have bigger and bolder font. But then for each of your slides,\nyou don't want that same size. So this has a size of 44 as well. So, those are the basics\nwhen working with slides. There's different types of\nlayouts that we can use. And then for each slide, each\nslide has its own placeholders. Content placeholder, picture\nplaceholder, different things that we can do here as well. Go ahead and insert a slide,\nand go ahead and take a look at the difference between the two. We can also change the slide. So if I right click on the slide here, I'll go down to layout. Maybe I want to change this\nto content with caption and we can see, so now we\nhave a little more detail. We still have our content placeholder\nover here to the right, but we have a title and text over here as well. Insert a few slides, change the layouts\nand take a look at the placeholders on each slide and come right back. Welcome back. Well, let's go ahead and start\ndesigning our slide here. I'm going to delete the second slide. Now, to delete a slide,\nI can simply click on it. I can see that it's highlighted here,\nand I can either press the delete key or I can right click on it and\nchoose the delete slide command. Either way, I'm going to go\nahead and delete this slide. I'll go ahead and put a title in here. So I'll call this PowerPoint and I'll go ahead and put module one here. Why not? So PowerPoint module one. So we've started. We see we can just simply\nclick on a placeholder and start typing content in there. Now I don't have any colors in here. Everything is just black\nand white, very plain. So the next logical thing\nto do is choose a design. So let's go ahead and\nclick on the design tab. And now we have what's called themes. So we're basically going to go ahead\nand choose a theme, and depending on the theme that you choose,\nyou have what's called variants. So maybe you want a different\nvariation of that particular theme. Maybe that theme is also available\nin blue or purple or orange. We can go ahead and do that. So the first thing I want\nto do is choose a theme. theme. By default, we're using the\nbasic office theme here. Here's the first one, facet. So we can see it adds some, I'll go\nahead and actually click on there. So we can see kind of\nadd some details in here. Let's go ahead and insert a slide as well. So let's go ahead and insert a new slide. Now take a look at the different\nslide layouts that are available. Remember, originally we had nine. Now we have quite a few more here. So each theme will have their own kind\nof special layouts that you can use here. For example, this one has a\nname card that we can use. Let's just add a title and content. And let's go back to the design tab. Let's just continue previewing the\ndifferent designs here that we can use. I'll click on the gallery\ntheme here, and we can see that that's what that looks like. So, here's my title slide, and\nhere's my title and content slide. So, usually spend a little bit of\ntime choosing the theme that is right. Here's another theme. Here's one of my favorite. Here's the Ion boardroom theme. And so I'll go ahead and\nchoose Ion Boardroom. And then I'm going to go ahead and choose\none of these different variants here. So I have four different\nones that I can choose from. Let's see what this would\nlook like with the this color. Here's the bluish color. And also here's the\norange color here as well. So we can use that. Organic is pretty nice as well. But also comes with variants. Go ahead and choose one. Very classy. This one looks very classy. So go ahead and choose one and\njust take a look and see what slide layouts are available. And take a look and see how it's\nactually changing the look and feel of your presentation here. I'm gonna go ahead and choose,\nlet's see where is the Dividend. I like dividend. Can't find it right now. Here it is. I like dividend. If you just hover over it,\nit gives you the name of it. I'll go ahead and use this and I'll\nchange it to this variant here as well. So pretty nice, very modern, very classy. Finally, let's see what displays. Okay. So we just have the basic layouts here. So go ahead and take a look at that. Go ahead and click on the design tab. Choose a theme, choose a variant, and then\ntake a look at the different slide layouts that are available and come right back. Welcome back. Okay, so I have my title slide\nhere, PowerPoint Module 1. I have my title and content here. Let's just go ahead and document\nwhat we've learned so far. So I'll go ahead and put Lesson 1 in here. And Lesson 1 was all\nabout getting started. Now you notice with this particular\ntheme that I selected, It's automatically capitalizing all of the letters that I\ntype here in the, um, in the title area. I'll go ahead and click inside\nof my content placeholder here, and we'll just talk about some\nthings that we learned here. We talked about the start screen,\nwe talked about the ribbon, and I'm just working with a list here. So if I just press enter, we can see\nI'm working with a bulleted list. Most of the content placeholders that we\nwork with, they will incorporate bullets. as well. So start screen ribbon. Uh, we also talked about just\ndifferent, um, slide layouts and we're able to take a look\nat, um, content placeholders. So content placeholders here. That's pretty much what we\ncovered here in lesson one. For lesson two, let's go\nahead and insert a new slide. Let's go ahead and also\ninsert a title and content. So if lesson two we started talking about just\nhow to develop a presentation. So developing a presentation. So one of the first things\nwe need to do is choose a design. Able to choose a design slash theme and optionally choose a variant as well. So that's what we've done so far. Let's continue developing our\npresentation here in lesson two. Now, we're still talking\nabout design here. Now, one of the things that's\navailable is the designer. Now, the designer, it's right here on my\nhome tab, all the way to the far right. We can see I have my designer right here. Now, what the designer is,\nlet's see if we mouse over it. Gives us a little detail. opens the designer pane for\ninstant slide makeovers. So what if you chose a theme,\nbut you're not, you know, you want a little more flexibility. You want a little more\ncontent on your slide. Let's take a look and see based on the\ncontent that we have on this slide. Let's see what the designer\nwill provide for us. So I'll click on the designer here. Now notice when I clicked on the\ndesigner, it's giving me different slides to be able to choose from. So this is using an infographic,\nso it's creating an infographic for me that I can use. The third one here puts\na picture on the left. So the designer basically analyzes the\ncontent that's on your slide, and then it tries to create a slide based on the\ntext that you have on here or pictures. The designer really likes pictures. If I were to add a picture in\nhere, we would see a lot more options that are available. But let's just scroll down here. So basically, if you like one\nof these designs, you can go ahead and just click on it. And that will actually convert your\nslide to that particular design. I'll go ahead and choose this one here. And as you can see, it converted our\ntext into what's called smart art. We'll cover smart art at another\ntime, but it created a nice infographic for us here as well. I can press control Z to undo that. So would you rather have\nyour slide look like this? Would you rather have it look like this? I can always change this if I want to. So if I go back to the top here, let's\nsee this one as a picture on the left. Okay. So that looks pretty nice. Nice little accent color here as well. So you can always change them. But I like these. It's giving us some nice, simple\nlayouts to choose from here as well. Now this is on a per slide basis. This is not going to\nchange every slide for you. If I go back to the title slide\nhere, we'll notice that we have different options that are available. If I want to see more, I can\nclick on see more designs. So that's how the designer works. Sometimes it will not find\na design for you right away. You can always come back a little\nlater and apply a design here as well. I'm going to go ahead\nand choose one of these. I'll choose this one. Nice and elegant. And for my second slide, I'll go ahead\nand convert that to an infographic. So, not so bad. We used the designer. We have three really nice looking slides. We did not have to worry about\nplacing these objects on here and making sure that they align properly. The designer took care of that for us. Everything is lined up. Everything is kind of snapped\nto the grid here as well. So, go ahead and turn on the designer. Go ahead and apply a couple\nof designs to your first three slides and come right back. Welcome back. Well, hopefully you found a\ndesign theme that you'd like. Hopefully you're able to design\neach of your slides individually by using the designer here. So for lesson two, we'll continue\ntalking about developing a presentation. I just added another line here,\ndesigning slides with the designer. So when we're developing a\npresentation, the first step is kind of choosing your design. And after that is adding content. Now, once you add content, The next thing\nthat you may want to do is to either, well, really to work with the text. So here's my text here\non slide number three. Looks a little small. I have a lot of space here at the\ntop and on the bottom, and let's go ahead and take a look and see. I'll go ahead and just\nhighlight the text here. I can double click to highlight a word. I can triple click to\nhighlight an entire row. And once I do that, I can see that\nthis is using the font size of 18. Now, based on the theme that I've\nselected, it uses its own font. As well, right? Because a theme, basically a\ntheme, I'll put the detail here. I'm going to press enter. I'll press tab. So a theme is basically\na set of fonts, colors, and effects. So each theme has its own set\nof fonts, colors, and effects. So that's why we notice that\nthe font type has changed here. Okay, well, let's go ahead and take\na look at a couple of font commands. Maybe I want to change the color here. Maybe I want to change the,\nyou know, change the effect. Maybe make some with the text\nshadow, some bold, italicized. Let's take a look at some of these\ndifferent font commands here. Going to highlight my first row here,\nand I'll go ahead and make that bold. And I can go ahead and\nmake that italicized. I can go ahead and use\nthe text shadow here. So the text shadow kind of gives\nit a nice shadow behind it. I'll go ahead and remove the\nbold and italicize from there. So it's just a subtle way to kind of\ncall attention to something here as well. Uh, what about, let's see,\nwhat else can I do here? Now, here's the strikethrough. So this kind of crosses it out for me. So we're just kind of\nexploring the different font commands that are available. Now, what about, uh,\nhere's the change case. Now this is pretty neat. I can do something like\ncapitalize each word. So notice all of my words are\ncapitalized here, so like a title. So I can do that. I'm going to remove\nthe strikethrough here. I'll remove the text shadow. If I want to make it all uppercase,\nI can go ahead and do that. But I think I'm good. I'm just going to leave it as\nsentence casing here as well. Now I do want to make\neverything a little bigger. Right now it's 18. So I want to increase the size. So I'm going to highlight\nall of the content in here. And what I'll do is I'll\nclick on the big A here. And this will make my text\njust a little bit bigger. And maybe about there. I just want to make sure\nit's not as big as my title. So my title is 28. And now I'm at 24. So that looks pretty good. I can go ahead and do that. Now this is a level two item here\nbecause I have a, I indented this so it's, so by default it's smaller\nthan the level one item here as well. So I'll go ahead and make this italicized. If you like shortcuts, as you hover over\nthese different commands, if a shortcut is available, it will be displayed for you. So if I wanted to make this\ntext bold, I can press ctrl b, ctrl i will italicize it for me. Control U will place the\nunderline there as well, so we can use those font commands. I'm going to go ahead and make\nthat italicized, and maybe I'll make that all uppercase as well. I'll also change the color. Now when you're changing colors in\nPowerPoint, You'll notice that you have what's called theme colors. So again, remember a theme is a\nset of colors, fonts, and effects. So these are the different colors\nthat come with this particular theme, this dividend theme that I chose here. We have different varieties of that\ncolor, and we always have these standard colors down here as well. Now, you want to kind of stay\naway from the standard colors. Because the professional that created this\ntheme, these colors work together well. So if I choose any of these colors,\nit's not going to adversely affect the look and feel of my text there. But if I were to choose a standard\ncolor, I can kind of see it's not really a nice contrast right away. Not all of them, just\nsome of them here as well. So maybe I want to change this. Not a lot of color options available here. A lot of kind of, you know, dull colors. But there you go. So I can go ahead and\nchange that if I want to. We also have the highlighter. So if you wanted to highlight something,\nyou can use the highlighter here. Not a big fan of it though. I typically don't use that. So we can do that as well. So, we can change the font size,\nwe can apply these different font commands here as well. I can also go ahead and maybe, you\nknow, change the, change my bullets. So right now, because of this particular\ntheme, I have these square bullets. If I click on the bullets drop down here,\nI can change that to maybe arrows, or star bullets, or hollow square bullets. I'll use hollow square and I'm good to go. I'm going to go ahead and remove this\nhighlighting here so I can say no color. Another really nice tool that I\nlike to use in the font command group is this little eraser here. Now what this does, this will\nallow us to remove the formatting from any chunk of text. So if I wanted to reset\nthis here back to the text. I can go ahead and click here. Notice how it puts it back\nto normal for me, with the exception of the sentence casing. So I can go ahead and do that as well. So go ahead and insert some text. Go ahead and take a look at the\ndifferent font commands that are available and come right back. Welcome back. So that wraps up lesson two. So we're able to choose a design\nOr, we're able to design slides with the designer, and we're able\nto add some content here as well. Let's go ahead and insert a new slide. There's several ways that we can do this. Let's go ahead and turn\non our notes actually. This way we can kind of document\nany kind of tips and tricks that we're learning here as well. So I'll click on notes here. This opens up my notes pane, and\nI can go ahead and type in here. So, a, a shortcut for us, if we\nwant to insert a slide, we can press control plus M, as in Mary,\nthat will insert a slide for us. Or, if I click on that third slide here\nand just press the enter key, it basically inserts the same type of slide for me. So I have the title and\ncontent here as well. If I press control Z to undo that, the\nother way is I can click on the new slide dropdown here like we did before,\nand I can go ahead and choose another type, but if I just want the title and\ncontent, I can just press control M, or I can just press the enter key as\nlong as I have the slide selected here. I'm just going to press enter\nhere, and here is my slide. Let's put the lesson three in here, and lesson three is all about formatting content. Now when it comes to content,\nwe'll talk about just a few here. So we're able to, um, we're\nable to format some text. We're going to, um, format our\nplaceholder, and then we'll go ahead and format a text box as well. So when it comes to formatting text,\none of the things that we can do, we can always highlight the text and we can apply\none of these font commands if we want to. But let's go ahead and use the shape\nformat tab to format all the text that's inside of our placeholder here. Now if you notice I'm clicked inside\nof my placeholder and take a look at the border we can see that we\nhave a dashed line or a dotted line. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the border here. Once I click on the border, I\nnotice that I have a solid line. Now when you do that, that's the\nsame thing as selecting all of the text inside of the placeholder here. So I clicked on the border, I have\na solid line, and now I can do something like change the font color\nfor all of my content that's in there. I can make everything bold if I want to. So that's one thing that we can do. I'm going to put this back to black here. Now, I want to introduce you to\nwhat's called a contextual tab. I'll put this up here. So the contextual tab is the key\nto formatting different objects. So I'll put that in the notes here. Format objects. Objects are things like\ntext boxes, charts, tables, and so forth and so on. Images, icons, shapes. So notice, When I click inside of\nmy placeholder here, if you take a look at the end of my ribbon, I\nhave what's called shape format. So this is contextual or on demand. It only appears when I'm\ninteracting with an object. So if I click on the blank area on\nmy canvas here, notice it goes away. It's no longer there. But if I click inside of my title\nplaceholder, I get shape format. If I click here inside of my. content placeholder, I get shape format. Let's click on that and\nlet's see what we can do. So what I can do is I have a, well,\nlet's take a look at WordArt first. So I'll click on shape format. I want to make sure I clicked on\nthe border here and here's just some different WordArt that we can use. WordArt, they come with a lot of\ndifferent types of formatting. So this one has a black with a shadow. So here's the second one. Blue, gray, accent color one, shadow. So some of these are very\nsubtle or very intense. So it's a quick way to just kind of\ncall attention to your content by using one of these word art styles. Some are very simple. Some are very, very complex. You can click here. We can see all the word art\nstyles that are available. I'll go with the basic shadow. Almost like our Actually it did, it\ndid apply the text shadow for us. So it's the same command. Let's go ahead and format\nthis content placeholder. I'm going to resize it. So I'll click here. I'm just going to drag it over to about there. Don't need for it to be that big. And I'll click on shape format. Now, once we click on the shape format,\nthis is the key to formatting content. Once we click on here, we can do\nthings like give it a shape style. Or we can give it a shape effect. We can resize it using the resizing tool. We can even align it here as well. Let's just take a look at some\nshape styles that are available. What if I wanted to put a background color\njust inside of my content placeholder? Not the entire slide. What if I wanted some effects? Nice border around here as well. Well, that's what a shape style is. If you click on shape style, here are\nthe different styles that are available. Very simple. Then it gets a little more\ncomplex as we go down the list. So we can see this, this first row\nhere, it's just an outline color, just different theme color outlines. If I click on the more options\nhere, here are all of the shape styles that are available. So that second row combines a\nfill color with a border color. So I can use that. If we go down the list,\nwe have different effects. So we have some gradient effect,\nkind of like a two tone look. We have shadows. Now we have shadow with a glow as well. So the bottom line is you don't\nhave to just settle for the default layout of your content placeholders. You can give it a quick\nstyle if you want to. I'm just going to go ahead\nand give this a basic one. So I'll just give it a Basic style here. And let's take a look at shape effects. Different presets. So here's a preset one. So it gives it that nice\nkind of white border. Looks a little three dimensional. And so just go ahead and check them out. Different presets. Right. There's a basic one in the\nshadow on the bottom right. So, we have, we have shadows that\nwe can use, some basic shadows or some more complex shadows. We have reflections, some are subtle, some are intense. We have glows, so we can give it\nan outside glow if we want to. We have soft edges and\nwe have bevels as well. I'll just give it a I'll\nleave mine as is here as well. All right. Then, of course, we can go ahead\nand resize this if we want to. Make it higher or wider. We can go ahead and do that as well. So go ahead and add some content\nto your content placeholder. Click on the shape format tab. Toggle some of the different shape styles. some of the different effects. Check out WordArt as\nwell and come right back. Let's continue lesson three. So we took a look at the contextual\ntab, in this case the shape format. We're able to insert some text. We formatted the text using the\ncouple of the WordArt styles here. And we're able to format the\nplaceholder by either choosing a shape effect or a shape style. Also being able to resize it here as well. Let's go ahead and insert an object. Let's insert a text box. Let's click on the insert tab. And from the insert tab, let's\ngo ahead and insert a text box from the text command group. So this is an object that\nwe're actually adding here. So we can draw a text box anywhere. And text boxes are great because we\ncan resize them, we can add a style to them, we can add text to it. I'll go ahead and click here. Now we have to draw it. So here's my little drawing tool. So I'm just going to draw it. You can make it as big as you want to. You can always resize it a little later. I'm just going to go to about\nhere, make it about that big. So as soon as I enter my text box here,\nI'm going to go ahead and add some content in there, and then I'll take a look at\nthe shape format to see what's available. Now, these two are identical, so my\ntext box and my content placeholder, you'll notice a lot of the same tools\nare available once we start interacting with our text box here as well. Actually, before I start adding text,\nI'll click on the shape format tab. I'll go ahead and give\nthis a quick A quick style. We'll go ahead and we'll\ngo with this orange here. I'm actually going to go ahead\nand change my variant here. So I'll click on the design tab\nand I'll go for a more blue. color here just for purposes\nof this demonstration. So I'll just change my variant to blue. Again, you can always change at\nany point in your presentation before you deliver it. So I'll go ahead and add some\ncontent here for my text box. So, so I'll say use the contextual tab to format objects. Text boxes. I'll just say text boxes gives more. So there we go. So here's my text box. So I can move it. So what if I wanted to go ahead and\nmove this text box somewhere else? What I can do is click on the border. So take a look at my cursor. It's that diagonal arrow. If I move my cursor inside\nof the text box, I have my basically typing cursor here. If I move my cursor to the, to\nthe border or the outside, it changes to this four way crosshair. Now that lets me know I can grab it. So now I can go ahead and move it. So I click and drag and I can move it. to anywhere I want to on the slide. So maybe I want to place it\ndown here towards the bottom. I can go ahead and do that. But let's get a little help here. Maybe I want to go ahead\nand snap it exactly to the bottom right of my slide here. So I'll click on shape format and\nover here in the arrange command group, I'll choose the alignment here. So I'll click on align So first, I want\nto align it to the bottom of the slide. Notice how it snaps it to the\nbottom of the slide for me. Next, I want to go ahead\nand align it to the right. So, there you go. I can snap it right to the\nbottom right if I want to. If I click back on here, I decide\nlater I want to align it to the middle. I can go ahead and do that. I can align center. There we go. All right, or I can just go ahead\nand drag it down here as well. I'm gonna align it to the bottom\nright, so bottom, and then align it to the right, and there we go. So those are text boxes. If you want to, we can actually\ncopy and paste this text box. If I right click on it, I can copy it,\nand I can paste, and this allows me to have the exact replica here as well. And there we go. So those are text boxes. I'm going to go ahead and\nmove this back up here. And there we go. So go ahead and insert a few text\nboxes, add some content in there, click on the shape format tab, and\ngo ahead and give it a quick style. Come right back. Welcome back. So that concludes lesson\nthree, formatting content. As we continue with our course, we'll\nbe spending a lot of time working with the contextual tabs that appears\nwhen we insert different objects. Let's go ahead and insert\nanother slide for lesson four. And this time we want a two content slide. Let's go ahead and insert that. Here are two content placeholders, one on the left, one on the right. So let's go ahead and\nput in lesson four here. Lesson four is all about graphical elements. So when we talk about graphical\nelements, we talk about pictures, we talk about icons, and so forth and so on. So let's go ahead and insert an image. Now, several ways we can insert an image. Right here in the content placeholder,\nwe can see that we have two options here to insert an image. We can also click on the insert tab. So if we click on the insert\ntab, we can insert pictures. We'll get a list of different\ntypes of pictures that we can add. We can also do it right here\nfrom the content placeholder. The first one here is stock images. The second one is pictures. So, if I click here, it opens up\nthe folder structure on my computer. Let's click on stock images. So, these are the Microsoft\nstock images that we can reuse. Now, when we get here, here's\nthe stock images dialog. There's different things\nthat we can search for. So, by default, we're looking for images. But we can also search for icons. We have cutout people, stickers, videos,\nillustration, and cartoon people. So there's a lot of different\ncontent that we can add here as well. So if you click on icons, let's\njust quickly preview them. Icons are pretty cool. There's pretty much an icon for\neverything that you want to express. And they always come in the same size. They're always one, one by one. We have cutout people. So we have Carrie, we have Stanley,\nLance, so forth and so on, and they have different expressions that we can\nuse to drive a point home in our slide. And of course we have stickers. Everyone loves stickers. We have short videos. These are about 10\nseconds or so, maybe 12. We have illustrations that we can use, kind of like\nicons, but they have a little more color, a little more detail. And then we have cartoon people\nthat we can use here as well. But let's go ahead and insert an image. We want to insert an image that\nwe want to go ahead and edit that actual image or format that image. using the contextual tab that will\nappear after we insert our image. So I'll go ahead and\nsearch for an image here. I'll look for something\nrelated to learning. You can look for any picture you want. Let's see. I'll scroll down here, look for something. Let's change that. Maybe I'll look for something with a team. I'll go ahead and grab this one here. Nice colors in there. I'll go ahead and insert that picture. So it inserts that picture for\nus right inside of that content placeholder, which is very, very nice. If I were to insert this picture,\nsometimes what happens is the picture appears so big that it's\nkind of like going off of your slide. In that case, we would need to click on\nthe format, but let's keep it simple. Let's go ahead. This is a very nice picture. Let's go ahead and click\non the picture format. And, the first thing we'll notice\nis that we have different picture styles that we can choose from. On the far left, we have some\nadjustments that we can make, as well. Some corrections, recolor. Let's preview them, and\nlet's see what we can do. We want to get to picture styles\neventually, but let's go ahead and take a look and see what's available here. So, here's some different corrections, so\nI can either sharpen or soften the picture If I want to, take a look at my picture as\nI'm hovering over these different options. So I can brighten the picture,\njust some simple edits that we can do to this particular picture. Here is color. So I can recolor it, the saturation, really saturated here, 400%,\nI can change the color tone. Temperature change. And then I can recolor it if I want to. So lots of pretty cool\nthings that we can do. We have different artistic effects. So if I wanted to make this look more\nlike a marker, or a pencil grayscale, or a pencil sketch, I can go ahead and do that. So some pretty nice ones here as well. There's glass. Glassy look. So, pretty, pretty nice. We have transparency and then we'll head\non over here to different picture styles. I always use picture styles when\nI insert a picture, you don't want it to appear flat on our canvas. You want it to stand out. So click on that picture format\nand let's take a look at these different styles that we can use. So here's a simple frame white, just\nputs a nice white frame on the outside. And go ahead and preview those. So here's a metal frame. That looks pretty cool. Here's a basic shadow. Here's one of my favorites. Reflected rounded rectangle. If we click here on the all,\nwe can see all of the picture styles that are available. And here's my favorite. This bevel rectangle. Nice, modern, modern. Look and feel here as well. I'll go ahead and choose one more. My other one that I like is this one. It's a reflected bevel black. So pretty, pretty nice. Just like with our shape format,\nwe have picture effects as well. Different presets that we can use. We can come sometimes combine\nthem with a picture style. Sometimes they overwrite each other. So typically you're either choosing a\npicture style or you're creating your own picture effect by choosing a shadow,\nreflection, glow, and so forth and so on. So go ahead and insert a picture. Go ahead and click on\nthe picture format tab. Take a look at some of the adjustments\nand go ahead and choose a picture style. Come right back. We'll take a look at a few more tools. Welcome back. Hopefully you had fun taking a look\nat those picture format styles here. Let's take a look at a few more tools. Let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe cropping tool for our picture, and then we'll take a look at the\nbackground removal tool here as well. So I'll go ahead and maybe\nI want to crop this picture. So maybe I want to remove some\nof the space here at the top. Maybe I want to just kind of remove it. from here as well. So I can do that. I'll go ahead and click on my picture\nand I'll click on the picture format contextual tab and the size command group. I'll go ahead and click\non the cropping tool here. So once I click here,\nI am in cropping mode. So here are my different\ncropping handles that I can use. So what I'll do, I'll go ahead\nand move everything up here. I want to come to about Here. And I'll come down just a\nlittle bit from the top. Coming from the sides as well. So there's my new picture. That's what the new\npicture would look like. Now, What I can do is just click away\nfrom the picture, and as you can see, I just cropped the picture from the bottom,\nthe sides, and the top here as well. So that's the cropping\ntool that we can use. Now if you made a big mess of\nyour picture, what we can always do is we can reset the picture. We can reset the picture based on\nthe formatting that we chose, or the formatting and the original size. So if I want to reset everything\nhere, I'll click on Reset Picture. If I click on Reset Picture, it basically\nremoves the formatting, so the styles and the effects here, but it's still cropped. If I click on Reset Picture and Size, it\nputs my picture back to the original size. So here's one of the problems that\nwe face when we insert pictures. It's really big, we can't see it. No need to panic. What we're going to do is locate the\npicture format tab and we're going to resize it using the width here. So if I go here, I'll just click on that\ndown arrow until it comes back into focus. I can actually see it on my slide. Notice as I'm using this tool, it's\nbasically maintaining the aspect ratio. So it's not distorting my picture. It's not making it flat\nor so forth and so on. So I'll just go ahead and do that\nuntil I get it to the size that I like. I can also resize the picture by\nusing one of these corner handles. If I use the corner handles to resize the\npicture, it does not distort the picture. If I use this top or bottom or left\nor right, it This will distort the picture, so I don't want to use those. I'm going to use one of these to\nmake it a little bigger and still maintain the aspect ratio here as well. So that's how you reset the picture. Let's go ahead and insert\nanother picture here. And let's take a look at\nthe background removal tool. Let's see if I can find\nmy buddy the eagle here. So I want a picture of this eagle. But let's see, maybe I'll grab this one. I want to remove the background from it. I'll go ahead and insert that\ninto my content placeholder and going to make it a little bigger\nso I can see a little better here. So again, I'll use the corner resize,\nnot one of the side ones here. Notice how it flattens the picture. So I'll use one of the Corners here. And Let's see. I'll put it over this one for\nnow so it doesn't get in the way. So really nice picture, but I want to\ngo ahead and remove the background. I just want to kind of cut out\nmy ego from this picture here. So we do have a remove background tool. I'll click on shape format and\nhere is my move background. Once I click on here, it's going to put\nme into the remove background editor. It's a simple editor. If I click here, it gives me a\ncouple of different options here. Now take a look at what\nactually did a pretty good job. It actually removed most\nof the background for me. So it automatically tries\nto remove the background. This one is very, very good. I actually don't really\nneed to do anything here. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on keep changes. And look at that. So it removed the background\ncompletely for me. And now I can go ahead and crop this. I don't need all that white space here. Get rid of all that white space. So this worked a lot better\nthan I expected it to. Sometimes you just need to\nkind of interact with it. But let me go ahead\nand insert another one. I'll insert my other eagle. So stock image. And I'll grab this one here. And just make it a little smaller. Okay, so that's fine. I'm going to delete this other one. I'll just press click on it\nand press the delete key. And I'll delete this\ncontent placeholder as well. Okay, so here's my eagle. Let's take a look at the\nbackground removal tool. Okay, so this one did a pretty good\njob, but you can see it's still trying to remove parts of the head here. So at this point, what I need to do\nis, I need, I need, I have two options. I can choose to mark the areas I want to\nkeep or mark the areas I want to remove. It's removed most of it, so I want to keep the head here. And that did pretty good. And I want to keep the talons. So here are the talons down here. I want to remove the background\nfrom between the talons here. So I'm just kind of pointing to where\nI want to keep, where I want to remove. And there you go. That looks pretty good. I think I'm good to go. So I'll click on keep changes. I can also discard all changes if\nI just don't like the way it looks. I'll keep my changes. Here's my eagle. I'm going to go ahead and resize it. And here we go. So that is the background removal tool. All right, so pretty, pretty nice. Now remember, you can always upload\npictures into, so if you have a picture on your computer, you can\nupload it right here into PowerPoint. Take advantage of these simple\nediting options here as well. Let's finish up lesson four by\ntaking a look at the eyedropper. Now, Eyedropper is a really nice tool. In this case, what I want to do, I'm going\nto delete the picture of my eagle here. I can actually right click and save this\nas a picture to my computer if I want to. This will save all those\nformatting that I used here. I'm going to go ahead and\npress delete just to remove it. And I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert just a few text boxes here. I'll insert about four. And I'll just call this one. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert another text box. And this is going to be, I'll\nbe specific, this is color two. This is color one. And I'll insert two more. This is color three. And I'll do one more. I could duplicate the text box. I could copy and paste it as\nwell, but I'll keep it simple. We'll talk about that\nin another lesson here. So here I have four colors. So what I want to do is I want to\ngo ahead and I like this picture. So I want to go ahead and pick up\nsome of the colors from this picture. So maybe from the shirt, I\nwant to go ahead and apply that color to this text box here. Maybe this color to that text box. Right, and so forth and so on. So if I wanted to recolor this text\nbox here, if I click on it and click on shape format, here is the text fill. So I can choose a fill color, so\nremember, I can choose a style that will recolor it for me. But what if I'm not finding\nthe color that I want? And if I click on, I'm sorry,\nshape fill, not text fill. So if I click on shape fill here. I'm pretty much limited to the colors\nbased on the theme that I have selected here or some of the standard colors. But as you can see, I\ncan't find this color here. So what I can do is click on more fill\ncolors and now it's really advanced. I get this kind of color palette\nhere I have to choose from. I can also click on custom and put in\nthe RGB value if I knew what it was. I do not know what the RGB\nvalue is of this color. So, I'm going to go ahead and hit\ncancel, but wait a minute, what I can do is I can use the eyedropper. I'll click on the shape fill again, and\nif you take a look, right underneath more fill colors, here's the eyedropper. Pick a fill color by clicking\nwithin the app window to pick a color outside of the app window. Click and drag. Okay, let's go ahead and\nturn on the eyedropper here. So here's my little eyedropper. And basically what I do when I\nmove over a color, if I just pause, it tells me what that color is. So this is light gray and\nthere's the RGB value. Well, I want this color for this shirt. So that's plum RGB value 882739. Let's see what happens if\nI click on that color here. Look at that. It actually found that color and\napplied that color to my text box here. Well, let's try that again. Let's click on this text box here. I'll click on shape\nformat for the shape fill. I'll grab the eyedropper and\nthis time I want this color. Let's see what color this is. So that is dark green. So if I click on here, it's\ngoing to apply that color. So it's basically replicating that color\nfor me from from one object to another. Huh, well let's see what else\nI can do with eyedropper. What if I wanted to grab something else,\nlike the color that's off of my slide. Maybe a color from another slide. Or maybe a color from my ribbon,\nlike this PowerPoint color here. Well, I can do that as well. It's a little tricky. Well, let's see. I want to grab this\nPowerPoint color up here. So, I'll click on shape format. I'll click on shape fill. This is pretty close to it, but not\nreally the color I'm looking for. So, I'll click on the eyedropper here. Now, once I move off the slide,\nNotice my eyedropper disappears. So, I want to get this color,\nbut my eyedropper disappeared. If you want to grab a color off\nof the slide, you need to, while you're still on the slide, hold down\nthe left mouse button and drag it. I'm still holding down\nthe left mouse button. So now I can go ahead and pull\nin the color from anywhere on my screen, either on PowerPoint,\nanother window that I have open. I can pull in color from anywhere. I'll go ahead and pull in this color. It's telling me it's red. And there we go. I'll go ahead and pull in the\ncolor from this slide here as well. We do have this color available, but\njust to demonstrate how we can do that, I'll grab my eyedropper again. So really, really cool tool. Again, I'll hold down\nthe left mouse button. Now I can drag and pull in any color. So that's turquoise. And let's see what else is in here. I'll go ahead and pull that in. So that is the eyedropper. So that's how we can use the\neyedropper to pull in colors from one object to the next here as well. So really, really nice tool, especially\nwhen you start to use PowerPoint often and you're customizing your designs. This is a really, really\nnice tool to be able to use. So go ahead and insert a few text boxes. Go ahead and add some text in there. And Use the eyedropper to take\ncolors from your picture and add them to your text box. Welcome back. So that covers our first four\nlessons completing module one. Now let's go ahead and save our\nwork and run our presentation. So a couple of different things\nthat we can do to save, we can press control plus S we can press F 12 or\nwe can press file and save as well. If I press control S\nbecause I'm logged into my. Outlook account. It's asking me to just\nsave it to my OneDrive. I can give it a name and I can press save. If I press the F12 key on\nmy keyboard, it pulls up the folder structure on my computer. Now I can save it to my\ndesktop or my documents. I'll save it to my desktop. I'll just call this PowerPoint module one and I'll press save. There you go. I'm good to go and I am saved. So let's go back. I'll click on the first slide here. And let's go ahead and run\nthis in presentation mode. Here are the different views. Here's normal view. Here's the slide sorter view. So again, the slide sorter\nview allows me to kind of move things around in a simple way. I want to do that. This is helpful if you\nhave a lot of slides. The next one here is the reading view. So, this will run my presentation for me. I'm going to go back to\nthe first slide here. So, here's lesson one. We talked about the start screen,\nthe ribbon, slide layouts, and content placeholders. Lesson two, we talked about\ndeveloping a presentation. In lesson three, we're able to\nformat content, specifically using the contextual tab. And then we're able to integrate images\nand formatting into our presentation. I'm going to run this in slideshow. I can also press F5 to run the slideshow. So here's my first slide. My title is missing. I need to fix that. If I go to the next slide. Now I'm presenting in full screen mode. I can press escape to end the\npresentation, or if I just keep going, it does that for me. End of the slideshow, click\nto exit, and I'm good to go. I'll go back to the normal view. And here we are. So we're saved. We're able to run the presentation. Not sure what happened to my title here. Oh, here it is. So it's hiding. Another lesson we'll take a look\nat how we can format objects when they don't behave just like this. There we go. All right. Very good. So congrats on completing module one. Let's go ahead. I'll share a file from module two\nand we'll work on that file together. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and dive into Module 2. I do have my practice file open\nhere for PowerPoint Module 2. Please make sure that you have that open. We have five slides here. Here's the title slide. And we have our four lessons. So Lesson 5 is about managing objects. I already have some content\non this slide for us. We'll take a look at different\nways that we can manage them. Lesson 6 is all about adding tables. We'll go ahead and insert a table or two. Lesson four, adding and managing charts. So we'll go ahead and add a\nchart and manage the data there as well, customize the chart. For lesson number eight, we'll take\na look at what we can do to prepare before we deliver a presentation. I'll go ahead and turn the notes on. So every slide will have a set of\nnotes, kind of different tasks that we'll be performing on those as well. Thank you. So I'll go back here to\nlesson number five, slide two. Actually, I'll go back to the,\nto the first slide and I'm gonna go ahead and choose a design. So feel free to choose a design right now. It's just very plain. So I'll go ahead and\nchoose a quick design here. I'll keep it simple. I'll either go for wood type and\nlet's see what that looks like. So, pretty simple, doesn't\nadd a lot of visuals. I'll stick to wood type, and then\nwe'll go ahead and jump into Lesson 5. So, go ahead and open up this\npractice file, come right back, we'll dive into Lesson 5. Welcome back. So, let's go ahead and jump into Lesson 5. So, what we want to do is just\nkind of overcome some of the issues that we will face when we have\nmultiple objects on a slide here. So we can see that we have a shape,\nwe have a text box, we also have three images here that we can work with. Well, we want to go ahead and\ncreate maybe our one year goals. You can use any scenario you'd like here. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on slide three. We want to convert this\nslide to look like this. So this slide is well balanced. We can see everything is pretty\naligned pretty nicely here. Everything is kind of on the same line. We can see that our picture is\ncenter aligned on the text box. Our shape is center aligned on the\ntext box and the picture as well. So let's go ahead and take a\nlook and see how we can do this. Let's go ahead and click\non slide number two. So, we'll be talking about grouping. We'll be discussing\naligning objects as well. So the first thing I want to do,\nI need to determine, well, how, what kind of layout do I want? How do I want to change this here? I'm going to go ahead and\nchange my title first. I'll call this my one year goals. I'll center align that and\nI'll move it up a little bit. But don't need for it to be. Take up that much space. And I'll go ahead and\naccept the correction here. So one year goals. And so what I want to do, I'm going to\ngo ahead and move these things around. So if you click on these different\nobjects, if you click on an image, you can click anywhere on the image and\nyou can pretty much move it around. So we can do that. With the shape, same thing. You click anywhere on a\nshape, you can move it around. Text boxes are a little different. Here. Now, if I click inside of a\ntext box, I can't move it. If I want to move a text box, I need\nto click on the border when I see that four way cross here and now I\ncan go ahead and move it as well. Okay, just for now, I'm just going\nto go ahead and move my pictures over here to the right and let's\nactually take care of that first. Let's go ahead and group these\npictures together and let's try and make them the same size. To group an object together,\nwhat we're going to do, we're going to use the CTRL command. So if you hold down the CTRL key,\nso I'll click on my picture here. I'm going to hold down the CTRL\nkey and click on this picture. I'll hold down the CTRL key again\nand I'll click on the third picture. So that is how you create a group. You can pretty much group anything. If I wanted to group my\nshape with this as well. I can go ahead and do that as well. I can also group my text box. But for now, let's understand\nhow grouping works. So right now I have these grouped. So what I can do now is I can\nuse my arrow keys and I can move these together like a group. So I can go to the right,\nI can go up, I can go down. I can do something like, if I click on\nthe picture format here, if I wanted to give all of them the same style. I can do that. So I can put all of them\ninside of a metal frame. I'm going to go ahead and choose a style. I'll choose the rounded diagonal corner. And then I'll go ahead\nand resize all of them. So I'll click on my bigger picture\nhere and I'll go ahead and just kind of resize all of them at the same time here. Great. So that's grouping. I can resize them together. Or, I can go ahead and move them\ntogether, or I can go ahead and apply the same type of style, or the\nsame type of picture effect, or some different adjustments here as well. Really, I can only recolor them. To break away from the grouping, just\nclick on a blank area, and now they're on groups, and I can move them freely. But I want them to all be the same size. So, I'll go ahead and check the size. I'm going to move my first picture\nover here, underneath my text box. Just want to make sure it's\nkind of the same width. So, I'm just going to\nresize it, to what I like. Now what I'm looking for, when\nyou're moving objects around, you'll get some temporary guidelines. As you can see, take a look at my picture. I have these, these four arrows here. I want to make sure it's the\nsame width as my text box above. So I'm just going to go ahead and\nresize it until I see that vertical dashed line on the left and the\nvertical dashed line here on the right. So those temporary lines, they\nlet me know that my picture is the same width as my text box. So that looks good. So what is the width of\nthis current picture? Because I want my other\npictures to have the same width. So if I take a look over here on the\npicture format, I can see that it is 1. 9 by 2. 97. So I want to make sure\nthat these are the same. So I'll click on my other\npicture, and I'll make this 1. 9, let's see, 1. 97, 2. 97. So 1. 97 and 2. 96, that's okay. I'll make this also 1. 9, 1. 97. Okay, so now they're all the same size. They all have to have the same\npicture style here as well. So that is how we group objects,\nand that's the benefit of grouping objects together. We'll see a little later, once\nwe have them grouped, we can also animate them together as well. Go ahead and group your pictures together. Apply a picture style. Go ahead and resize them so that they're\nall the same size and come right back. Now that I have all three of my\npictures, uh, as the same size, I'll go ahead and set this up here. So the first thing I want to do,\nthe next thing we'll talk about is arranging and aligning objects. We'll already see that when we're\nmoving an object on the canvas, we get all these little temporary lines here. Now look what happens if I move\nmy image right in the middle. of the slide. I get the vertical bar there\nand the horizontal bar. So that lets me know that I'm dead\ncenter or exactly in the middle of this slide, both vertically and horizontally. If I move to the right or to the left, there's that vertical line. Let's me know I'm aligned right there. If I go up or down, I can see that horizontal\nline there as well. So, also when you move an object, it\ngives you, it lets you know how you are aligned in relation to another object. So right now, I can see that I'm on the\nsame plane as my picture on the left. If I go up, it's showing me I'm aligned\nto my text box, to the middle of the text box, to the bottom of the text box. And right now, I'm\naligned to that picture. Right there as well. So look out for those temporary lines. We can also turn on the grid\nlines or the guidelines. If I click on the view tab here, I can go ahead and turn on, I can\neven turn on the ruler if I want to. I can turn on all three of these options. Let's see what I get. So here's the ruler. So as I kind of move, we can see\nwhere I am in relation to the ruler, both vertically and horizontally. Here are the grid lines. So Gridline is a really nice\nway to show where one object is in comparison to another. And then we have the guides. And so the guides gives\nus the vertical guide here and the horizontal guide. So lots of different things. I'll go ahead and turn off the grid lines. I just want the guides\nand the ruler for now. So, when we're arranging and\naligning objects, we need to first decide what we want to do. So, remember, we want\na horizontal alignment. So, three columns here as well. So, the first thing I need to\ndo is position my first object exactly where I want it to be. Everything else will be aligned\nbased on that first one here as well. So, I'll take my first text box here. I just want to align it to the left. Margin here. Let me move my shape out of the way. I just want to focus on this\nwhen I keep going to the left. Until I want to make sure I'm\nlined up with my text box here. My title box rather. So I'll move it to the left. Right there. So that's as far as I\nwant to go on the left. And I'll come down a little\nbit maybe to about here. My first object is in place. Everything else will be\nbased on that object. Now my picture, I'll go\nahead and align this. I can see it's aligned. I'll just move it down just a little bit. It's aligned with my text box here. And now here is my, I want to make sure that my\nlittle shape here with the number one is aligned, center aligned\non my picture and my text box. So there we go. The first three objects are aligned. And now I want to go ahead and add\nanother text box, two more text boxes and align these pictures as well. So what I can do, I can duplicate\nthis text box if I want to. So to duplicate an object,\nI'll press control D. So I'll click on my text box here. I want to make sure I'm clicking\non the border and not inside. Okay, so I'll click on the border. I see the solid line, and\nnow I can press control D, basically duplicates that for me. So any style, anything I had in\nthere would have been the same. Now I'll use those temporary\nguides to make sure I'm aligned horizontally with my first text box. And then I'm aligned with my\npicture on the bottom here as well. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthat one more time. So I'll press control D. And sometimes when you duplicate it\nagain, it kind of distributes it evenly, so it's the same space between the\nfirst one here, which is pretty good. So at this point, I'll go ahead and\nmake sure everything else is aligned. I'll go ahead and align my picture here. Make sure everything is okay. I'm gonna make sure my\npictures are the same height. I need to move this one\nup a little bit here. And there we go. So our three text boxes and\nour three pictures are aligned. Now I can duplicate my, my shape here. So I'll press control D and\nI'll press control D again. And so here are my shapes. I'll go ahead and make sure this\none is center aligned on my picture. And I'll move this one here. Make sure this is centered\naligned on this picture as well. And I'll go ahead and make\nthese a little bigger. So I'll group my shapes,\nhold down the CTRL key. Now when you're grouping shapes,\nI want to make sure I click on the border of the shape. If I try to click on the\ninside, it doesn't work. I want to click on the border. Hold down the CTRL key. I'm just going to resize these,\nmake them a little bigger. Make them as big as I\nwant to, maybe about, not that big. Now I can kind of move them. I want to center all of them. on each picture. I'll go ahead and change\nthis to, to number two. So this is goal number two. This is goal number three. I'm good to go. I'll turn on the, I'll\nturn off the guides. I'll turn on the grid lines. Just make sure that I'm\ncentered here on each of them. That's centered. That's centered. And that's centered. Make sure they're all in\nthe same horizontal plane. That looks pretty good. So I'm good to go. I pretty much have everything arranged\nexactly the way that I want it to be. So I'm good to go. What we can do now is if we want to\ngo ahead and add a style to these text boxes, we can go ahead and do that. So if you want to grab a quick shape,\nshape format, give those a particular style, you can go ahead and do that. And go ahead and add a style to\neach of your shapes here as well. And come right back. Welcome back. Okay. I'm going to turn off my grid lines here. So I'll click on the View tab. I'll uncheck the grid lines. I'll also turn off the ruler. Don't really need that right now. Now let's put it all together. Let's go ahead and animate. some of these different objects here. So this slide clearly\nstates our one year goals. We can see our first goal is\nhere, enrolled in martial arts. Oh, I need to go ahead\nand change the text here. I'll type, learn a new language. And the third one is travel to Europe. There we go. All right. So we have everything here. So we have a number representing\nthe sequence, a picture representing the goal, and the\ntext representing the goal as well. Let's click on the animations tab. Now, here's the animations tab. Here are different types of\nanimations that we can use. We're just going to\nuse a simple animation. We'll just use the wipe animation. You can try them out. when you pause the video. I'll go ahead and click on my\npicture here, and I want my picture to come in with an animation. So I'll choose the wipe\nanimation for my picture. So that's the first\nanimation on the slide. If I click on preview over here to\nthe top left, I can get a preview to see what this will look like. So when I, when I go from slide\nnumber one to slide number two, This is how it will be revealed\nafter I click on the sequence here. So let's just animate our pictures. So we can see the numbers here. Here's the first animation. Here's the second animation. And then we'll have a\nthird animation over here. So I'll click on my airplane here. I'll click on wipe. And let's see what this looks like. So I'll go ahead and run\nthis in reading view. Again, reading view is great\nbecause it doesn't take up the whole screen, and I can still\nmanage other windows if I want to. So I'll click on the reading here. And there we go. So this is what the slide looks like. So we can see that we have the text\nboxes and the numbers in the sequence. If I click next, or if I click to the\nright, it reveals that picture for me. If I click to the right again,\nhere's the other picture. And if I click to the right one more\ntime, here is the third one here as well. So animation is a really good\nway to kind of reveal things. or to reveal a lot of content on one\nslide, just one at a time, as opposed to revealing all the content here as well. I'm going to go back to normal\nview, go back to slide two. So that's not really what I want though. What if I want, you know, my text box and\nmy picture to come in at the same time? If I go ahead and give my text\nbox here an animation, Well, it's not going to come in in sequence. So what I want to do, I want to create\nan animation so that my text box and my picture comes in at the same time. Same thing here for the second one and\nthe same thing here for the third one. So I'm going to have three\nanimations on this slide. So when this slide is seen,\nthe only things that will be visible are my actual numbers. Right here. One, two, and three. So your audience already knows\nthey're expecting three different goals or content here as well. So to do that, I'm going to go\nahead and remove the animations. So I'll say none. Just going to reset everything here. Okay, now I'll do it. Picture, text box, wipe. One animation. picture, hold down the\ncontrol key, text box, wipe. There's my second animation,\npicture, text box, wipe. And there we go. Let's go ahead and run that. I'll press, uh, F5 to\nrun the presentation. Here's my title slide. Here's my second slide. We can see the numbers here. If I click or if I press next, Or if I\nuse the arrow key, notice how it comes in as one animation because we group\nthe text box and the picture together. I could have even grouped the shape\ndown here with it if I wanted to. But I wanted to keep it\nsimple, kind of like a reveal. So here's animation number\ntwo, learn a new language. Animation number three, travel to Europe. And we're good to go. So pretty good. So go ahead and check out\nthe different animations. Just click on a picture, check out\nthe different animations that are available, and then go ahead and\ngroup your animations together. You may need to remove the animations\nand then group them like I did so you don't run into any conflicts. So check them out, go ahead and\nanimate them and come right back. We'll move on to our next lesson. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number six. Adding tables. Adding tables is a great way to\ncondense information so that your audience can basically interpret\nthe information more efficiently. Let's go ahead and insert a table. We want a table that looks like this. So instead of writing out our one\nyear goals, we can express our one year goals in the form of a table. So we'll have a title, We'll have\nour different headers here, the goal, the priority, the progress,\nand the estimated cost for that particular goal here as well. So let's go ahead and use this. I'll go back to slide number three, and\nbecause I'm using a content placeholder, I can go ahead and insert a table by\nclicking on the table icon right here. The other way to insert a table\nis to click on the insert tab. And once I click on the\ninsert tab, so here's table. So those are two ways that\nwe can insert a table. Now let's just quickly take a look at the\ndifferent ways that we can insert a table. If I click on this drop down here,\nI can go ahead and draw the table. As you can see, if I want like a four\nby four table, my slide is already showing what that table will look like. That's probably the\nsimplest way to do that. I can also insert a table. So if I click on insert a table, it\nbasically asks me how many columns and how many rows would I like. So I can say four by four. I'm going to go ahead and hit cancel here. We also have the capability to use an\nExcel spreadsheet to to insert a table. We'll take a look at\nthat just a little bit. The Excel spreadsheet is going to give\nus the Excel ribbon that will allow us to incorporate more advanced features of\nthe table, such as calculations and more styles and designs, things like that. For now, let's go ahead and click\non the insert table icon inside of our content placeholder. And it gives us the option, how many\ncolumns and how many rows do we want? Well, for now, let's just say we want\nthree columns, and we want three rows. Let's go ahead and press OK. My content placeholder has\nbeen replaced by my 3x3 table. Before I start working on the table, I\nmight want to go ahead and give it a name. quick design. So notice, because we're working\nwith a table, we actually have two contextual tabs. One is for the table design. So this is all things cosmetic. And then we have the layout. So with these two tabs gives\nus all the tools we need to be able to manage this table. We'll keep it simple. We'll take a look at some of the essential\ntools that we'd need to use for now. I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose a table design. So When it comes to the table design,\nwe can see that we have recommended best match for our document. Don't like those though. We have light styles. We have medium styles, and then\nwe have some dark tables down here at the bottom as well. So kind of a table for all\ndifferent types, whatever you're looking for here as well. I'm going to go for a medium table. I'll give it this medium style\naccent one, and I'm good to go. Let's go ahead and enter\nsome data into our table. So the very top line is\ngoing to be my title. So I'll just call this one year goals. Down here on the bottom, the first\none is going to be my actual goal. I'll press the tab key\nto move to the next cell. So that's my goal. This will be the priority. Let's say on a scale of,\nuh, you know, 1 to 10. 10 being the highest priority. And then over here,\nlet's put the progress. How far I am along that goal here. I'll add my first goal. And my first goal, let's\nsay enroll and martial arts. Okay, I'll put the priority. This is priority, high priority. So I'll go 10 and the progress. This is actually about\n50 percent complete. Right, but I do have other goals. I want to go ahead and\nadd another row here. So to do that, I'm going\nto click on the layout tab. Now once I click on the layout tab,\nall the way to the far left we see a rows and columns command group. Now this is where I want to\ngo ahead and insert rows. So I can insert a row above,\nI can insert a row below. I do want to insert a row below, so I'll\ngo ahead and click on insert row below. As a matter of fact, I want two\nrows, so I'll click it two times. to add two rows. And there we go. I'll go ahead and enter my data in here. I also want another column to the\nright because I want to be able to add one more for the estimated cost. So I'll click on the column, and\nnow I can either, now that I've selected this particular column, I\ncan either insert one to the left or I can insert one to the right. I want to insert one to\nthe right, not to the left. So I'll click on insert\nright to add another column. There we go, I'll go ahead\nand put in the estimated cost and there we go. So that's how we insert a table. That's how we choose a\ntable design or table style. That's how we add a row and or a column. We can simply just type in each of\nthese cells and enter our information. Go ahead and fill out the rest of your\ntable and come right back and we'll take a look at some other table tools. Welcome back. So I went ahead and inserted all\nof my text here into my table. So what I want to do now, I\nwant to go ahead and merge the cells here on this top row. So as you can see, I have\none, two, three, four cells. I want to merge them and just have\none single cell for my title that will be centered here as well. So to do that, I'm going to go ahead\nand select Just click and drag and highlight all these cells on that top row. Then I'll click on the Layout tab. Now on the Layout tab, let's talk\nabout formatting the actual table. So when we're formatting the table,\nwe're talking about the Layout tab here. And over here in the Merge Cells\ncommand group, I'm going to go ahead and choose the Merge Cells command. That will convert these\nfour cells into one. I'll go ahead and do that here. And there we go. I can see that it's just\none cell here at the top. But the next thing I want to do,\nI want to go ahead and align it. So right now it's aligned\nto the left of the cell. As a matter of fact, if you take a look\non the layout tab in the alignment command group, we can see that it's basically\naligned to the top left of that cell. Actually, by default, all of my\ncells here, everything is aligned to the top left of that cell. of each cell. So for this particular cell, I\nwant to go ahead and make sure that everything is centered to the middle. So I'll go ahead and click center and center. So now it's centered vertically and\nhorizontally in this cell as well. Now, I want to do the same thing\nwith the rest of my, my table. So notice when I ran that command, it\nonly applied to this particular cell. So it only applies to\nwhat you have selected. So I'm going to go ahead and press\nControl A inside of my table. So if I press Control A, it highlights\neverything on my table here. Once I do that, I'm going to\ngo ahead and center everything. So there we go. I was able to center\neverything and I'm good to go. Now I do want my table to\nstand out a little bit here. Let's see what else we can do. So we took a look at\ninserting rows and columns. We used the merge. We took a look at some\nalignment options here as well. Now, We can go ahead and interact with the\ncell size if we want to, or I can click on my table and click on distribute columns. So, if I click here, nothing really happens. If I click on distribute rows, nothing\nreally, well, I do get a little bit here. So it attempts to make every row the same\nheight and every column the same width. It looks like all of my columns are\nalready the same width, so it did not really make any changes here as well. So if you maybe inherited a PowerPoint\nfile that has a table, and things just look really uneven, you can\nchoose the Distribute Rows and Distribute Columns command, and that\nwill take care of things for you. I can also resize the table if I\ngrab one of the fill handles here. Right? Right now it's perfectly aligned,\nbut if I want to make it bigger, I can go ahead and do that. I can even kind of do this. So you can pretty much resize the table\nin any fashion that you want here as well. So I'm good to go. So again, any formatting options,\nwe need to click on the layout tab to be able to do that as well. Now if you want to delete a particular row\nor a particular column, it's a matter of. clicking on the row. You don't have to\nhighlight the entire row. If you want to, that's okay. Just click on any row that you want to. And here's the delete command. So we can delete the entire table. We can delete the entire row,\nor we can delete that column. If I choose delete row,\nit deletes the row for me. Now I only have these three rows here. I'm going to go ahead and undo that. So I'll press control Z\nor I'll just press undo. There's my row again. Same applies for deleting a column. Just choose the delete. And you can choose to delete\na particular column as well. So those are the basics\nfor formatting a table. Go ahead and make those formats. Last thing I'll do, I want my\ntop two rows here to be bold. I want it to stand out. And I want my items on the\nleft to stand out as well. I'll make those bold. And there we go. I'm all done. If you want to go ahead and change the\ntable style, you can go ahead and do that. And come right back. So we were able to insert a table. Just to note, we can also copy a table\nfrom another Microsoft Office application. So if we have an existing table\nin a Microsoft Excel file, we can copy and paste that table\nright here into PowerPoint. And we can manage the\ntable in here as well. If we had a table in Microsoft Word,\nwe can also copy and paste that here. We can also copy and paste a table from\na web page and manage it here as well. For now, I want to go ahead\nand insert a new slide. So I'll insert a title only slide\nand I'll quickly just demo how we can add tables via Excel. So maybe you want some more tools to be\nable to kind of work with your table. Let's go ahead and click\non the insert tab here. And let's use the Excel\nspreadsheet option. So I'll go ahead and click\non Excel spreadsheet. And it's thinking and notice\nit opens up the Excel. So notice here's my PowerPoint up here. But right now I'm working\nwith the Excel interface. So basically my ribbon has been\nreplaced by the Excel here. Well, this gives me all the tools I need. I'm going to make this a little wider. So here's my Excel spreadsheet. And now I can go ahead and\ndo something like go ahead and just add my data in here. So maybe I'll just put some\nbasic information in here. I'll just put a sales rep and I'll pause this and finish this up. So you don't have to watch\nme type everything here. Okay, so here's my completed data here. So I have a few sales reps. We're tracking their weekly sales. So, for example, week one, Jane D. had sales of 21, 38, 32. Now, this is where the Excel interface\ncomes in, because now I can use the Excel tool, so I can give all\nthese the, uh, accounting format. And I could even drop in some\nsummaries and things in here if I want to use some calculations. I'll keep it simple though. I'm simply going to\nconvert this to a table. And I'll go for, we'll\ngo for this style here. All right. So here's my nice table. And once I'm done, I simply just need to\nclick away So how do we get rid of this? Once I click away, I click on\na blank area on my slide here. It's going to close the Excel overlay and\nit's going to insert this table for me. So I'll go ahead and click away from it. I'm done. And there is my table. Sometimes this will happen. It's actually showing too much detail. I don't want all of these\nblank cells in here. So, doesn't happen all the time. So, to overcome that, I want to\ngo ahead and edit this table. Now, one thing to note, notice after\nI inserted the table, PowerPoint is not treating it as a table. It's treating it as a shape. So, I cannot make any\nadjustments here to the table. If I want to edit it, I\nneed to double click on it. So, I'll double click the table. the shape here rather. And now it reopens the\nExcel overlay for me. I'm just going to resize this window here. I only want to see these particular cells. Let's see if this will work for me. There we go. Now it's misbehaving. There we go. And let's close that. Let's see what that looks like. Okay. So almost there. I'm going to make this a little bigger. Okay, this, so this basically gives us\nthe result of what we created in Excel. We cannot make any changes here,\nbut if we want to, we simply just need to double click on it and we can go ahead and make any changes. Like for example, I'm going\nto remove the filters. I don't need those buttons\nshowing up here at the top and still trying to get rid of this little problematic. There we go. So I'll click away. And there we go. So that looks better. So it's almost treating this as\na picture or an output as well. So if you want to use Excel to just\nhave some more robust functions and features and calculations, you can\nuse the Excel overlay to insert your table into PowerPoint here as well. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and take it a\nstep further by adding a chart to our PowerPoint presentation. So just like with a table, we have\ntwo opportunities to insert a chart. I can either click on the Insert\ntab, go ahead and insert a chart. I can insert a chart from my\ncontent placeholder as well. I can also insert a chart from Microsoft\nExcel so I can copy and paste an existing chart from Microsoft Excel. We'll keep it simple, we'll\ngo ahead and insert a chart. Now when we insert a chart, we will\nget a temporary Excel basic interface. We basically need to add\nour data to the interface. Let's go ahead and click on insert chart\nand let's see what we are provided with. So the first thing it asks us is, well,\nwhat type of chart do we want to use? So we have clustered column,\na really nice chart to be able to display a lot of values. We have line charts, pie charts. We can always change this a little later. Some of the more modern ones\nlike a tree map or sunburst. These are pretty good for. displaying one value at a\ntime, or one series at a time. I'll keep it simple. I'll insert that first\nclustered column chart. I'll press OK. So we'll notice that we have two things. I'm going to move this around\njust a little bit here. Here's our Excel window up here at the\ntop, and down here is the actual chart. I'm going to resize this,\nmake this a little bigger so I can see all of the data. So basically, whatever data we place\nThis in our little Excel window here will be displayed on the actual chart. So for example, if I were to put,\nlet's say my name here, right, maybe as a sales rep, I'll go for just a couple here. So we can see as we're typing the\ninformation in Excel, we can see that it's appearing down here. on our chart. So it's all based on the\ndata that we have up there. Now I could actually copy and\npaste the data in here as well. If I already have the data from Excel\nor from the table that I created earlier, I can paste it in here as well. But let's just put in a couple\nof quarterly sales values here. And I'll just start\nplugging in some numbers. So let's go 5, 000. So as you can see, it's already\ndisplaying here on our chart. I'm going to go ahead and\nput the dollar sign in front. These here as well. Because when we turn on the data\nlabels, we want to be able to see the dollar signs as well. I'll put, uh, put 2, 500 for here. 4400. This is going to be 2000. So I'll just follow the numbers\nhere, multiples of a thousand. So 3500, 1800, 3000, and 4500, and 5k. And there we go. So that's it. So once I close this here,\nHere is my actual chart. So that is how you insert a chart. And that is how you\nadd data to your chart. Go ahead and add some data. Come right back. We'll take a look at some customizations. We'll take a look at how we can edit\nthe data and so forth and so on. Now we were able to insert a chart, add\nsome data to the chart here as well. What if we wanted to do\nsomething like edit the data? Well, we have two contextual\ntabs here for the chart. Really it's just the chart design though. The format, just really some of the\nshape formatting tools that we can use. I'll stick to chart design. And under chart design, just like\nwith our table, we can choose a style. Now these styles are based on\nthe theme that you have selected. I did choose the wood type\ntheme, so here are the different styles that I have available. I can also edit the data if I want to. So what if I wanted to make\nsome changes to the data here? What if M Jones did not have 7,\n000 for quarter three, but 8, 000? Well, I can go ahead and do that. So I'll go ahead and click on\nedit data and basically reopens the Excel overlay for us. And now for quarter three, instead\nof 8, 000, I'll put, I'm sorry, 7, 000, I'll put, uh, 8, 000. We can already see. It's being applied here as well. I'm going to go ahead and close this. Now, before I close this, another\nthing that I can do while I'm here, so I can actually change or update\nmy data here, I can also decide what I want to be displayed on the chart. So, for example, what if I only\nwanted quarter one and quarter two to be displayed on the\nchart, but not quarter three? So we just want to focus\non the first half results. If you take a look at the bottom\nright, here's our little fill handle, that little square. So this basically lets us\nknow how far our data reaches. So right now it goes\nto column D and row 5. If I drag this over to column\nC and row 5, it's only going to show quarter 1 and quarter 2. So let's take a look at that. I'm going to go ahead and\ngrab this handle right here. So notice I have a white cross. When I move my cursor over that\nlittle small square, it changes to a diagonal two way arrow. That lets me know that I'm ready\nto go ahead and interact with it. I'm going to go ahead and click\nand hold and drag it to the left so that only quarter one and\nquarter two are being displayed. If I let go, take a look at my chart. We can see that only quarter one and\nquarter two are being displayed here now. So that's a quick way to kind\nof pick and choose what you want to be displayed on your chart. I do want quarter three as well. I'll go back over here and\nI'll go ahead and close it. So that's pretty much how you edit\ndata and how you select data as well. If you want to select your data the\ntraditional way, you click on the select data here, and we get this option over\nhere where we can choose what we want to be displayed, or we can just go\nahead and highlight the ranges that we want to be displayed here as well. I'm going to go ahead and hit cancel. I'll close this out and I'm good to go. Let's talk about chart design. Now, when we're customizing the chart,\nthere's a lot of options that we can use. We'll just take a look at\nsome of the essentials here. At the top right of the chart,\nyou'll notice these two icons. The first one with the plus sign,\nthese are the chart elements. Second one here is the paintbrush. If you hover over the chart elements,\nit tells us that we can add or remove things like the title, the legend,\nthe grid lines, and the data labels. If you hover over the\npaintbrush, we can set a style and color scheme for our chart. We'll do both. First, let's go ahead and click\non the chart elements here. And you'll notice we can turn things\noff or on, like turn the axis off or on. Right now it's turned on. I'll go ahead and turn it off. And as you can see, we, we lost\nall of our labels down here. So it's pretty difficult to\nexplain what we're looking at here. So I'll leave those turned on. And the access titles. So this just gives us\na little more detail. There's an extra text box here on\nthe vertical and horizontal plane. We can type in there,\nadd some more content. We can even format the text\nthat's in here if we want to. Change the font, the color, the size. I don't need that. I'll go ahead and turn that off. Here's my chart title. I'll go ahead and actually\nput something in here. I'll say quarterly sales. And as I mentioned before, I can go\nahead and change the color if I want to. Make it like a, uh, make it\nbold and italicized as well. Now for each of these elements, you'll\nnotice that there's a small arrow to the right of it indicating that we have\nsome other options such as the title that's being overlaid or above the chart. We have data labels. So if we turn the data labels on,\nwe can see the numerical values on top of each of the bars as well. Here's the data table. This is like a hybrid chart. So we have the chart on the\ntop, and then we have the Excel table down here on the bottom. This works well if you have a small table. If you have a large table,\nyou may not want to use that. I'll go ahead and turn that off. The good thing with the data table,\nit does come with its own legend. So I can actually turn off this\nlegend down here and save a little bit of space as well. We have error bars, not\nreally applicable here. And then we have the gridlines, we can\nturn them off, we can turn them on. I don't really need them if you have\nthe numbers here, and then we have the legend, I can turn them off or\non, or I can move them to the right. Now they're over here to the right, or I\ncan move them to the, let's see, move to the left as well, the top, the bottom. I'll leave them here on the bottom. So those are the different chart elements. Let's click on the paintbrush. So when you click on the paintbrush,\nyou'll notice that you have 14 different styles to choose from. So here's style 14, and this\nis a really nice way to quickly choose a design for your chart. Some of these will kind of\nmove things around for you. So style number two, you\ncan see my legend has moved. You can see that my values over\nhere on the vertical axis are gone. And take a look at the way that my\ndata labels are being displayed. They're vertical instead of horizontal. So go ahead and choose\none of these styles. I like style number\neight, nice dark style. I also like style 14 as well. You can also choose a color. So depending on the theme that you\nhave selected, you have different colorful palettes to choose from. And then you also, on the bottom, you\nhave different monochromatic, different shades of the same color here as well. So, go ahead and modify your chart. Go ahead and interact with\nsome of the chart elements. Go ahead and choose a chart style. Change the color as well. And, come right back. Now, after formatting the chart, there's\nsome other things that we can do. Before we insert a chart from\nExcel, we can also change the chart. So, if I click on the Chart Design tab,\nif I want to change this to another type of chart, I can go ahead and do so. Great. This brings us back to our first window\nwhere we can change the type of chart. So if I wanted a stack column\nchart, I can go ahead and do that. If I want a 3D clustered\ncolumn, I can do that. If I want a line chart, here are\ndifferent line charts that will integrate my existing data for me. If I want a pie chart, I remember\na pie chart tends to just focus on one value at a time. Here as well. So it looks like it's focusing\non the, let's see what week that is, a particular week. It looks like the week or the quarter three, not\nsure which one that is. And we have a bar and\nlet's see the tree map. So the tree map here, the bigger\nthe box, the higher the value. So again, this is going to be\nbased on quarters here as well. So we can change this to a different type. Let's try the tree map. We'll go ahead and press. Okay. And if I hover over it, it\nsays this is 5, 000, doesn't really give me too much detail. I will need to go ahead and, um,\nbasically go ahead and, and go into the advanced menu to kind of change\nto see what's being displayed here. So I'm gonna go ahead and change\nthis back to a clustered column. I'll go for 3D, I'll press\nOK, and I'm good to go. Now, let's go ahead. I'm going to go to insert another\nslide here, and this time I'm just going to go ahead and insert or copy\na chart, paste a chart from Excel. And let's see what options\nwe have here as well. I already have my chart. Here's my Excel window. So here's a chart that\nI created from the data. So I already have my chart here,\nso I don't feel like building this all over again in PowerPoint. So I'll write, I'll click on the chart. I'll right click on it. I'll copy it to the clipboard. I'll come back to PowerPoint. I'll click inside of this content\nplaceholder and I'll go ahead and paste it so I can use the destination theme and\nembed the chart into PowerPoint so I can manage the chart right here in PowerPoint. Or I can just kind of override the theme\nthat I'm currently using and basically carry over the theme from Excel. I don't want to do that. I prefer to stick to\nthe destination theme. And then we have use the\ndestination theme and link the data. So basically what this will allow us\nto do, if I make any changes to that chart in Excel will automatically\nupdate here in PowerPoint. Same thing here, and\nthen we have a picture. So I'll go ahead and use the\ndestination theme and link the data. So there we go. So here's our chart. Let's take a look at week one here. So this is the week one for Sarah. So Sarah week 20. Let's go ahead and make a change\nhere in Excel for Sarah's week 1. And to do that, I need to\ngo right here, Sarah week 1. I'll change this to 5, 000. We can see the chart has\nupdated here for Sarah. Let's take a look at PowerPoint. And there we go. We can see that it updates\nright away as well. So that's pretty much how that works. So if I want to make any edits, I simply\nneed to edit the data on the Excel file. And as long as I have PowerPoint\nopen, it's going to go ahead and update that for me automatically. Very good. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson 8. So, we'll just talk about preparing\nto deliver a presentation. Now, when it comes to doing\nthis, what we want to do is we want to run our spell checker. Now, we'll notice that the spell\nchecker is already kind of running in the background, so if I had any\ngrammatical errors, it would have already caught it for me, but I'll go\nahead and run the spell checker anyway. Spell check is complete. I'm good to go. The next thing to do is to check\nour animations and our transitions. Right now we don't have\nany transitions in here. Let's go ahead and run the presentation. Let's go ahead and save it first. So I'll press control s, make sure\nit's saved to my computer, and then I'll go ahead and run the presentation. So remember, if I want to run\nthe presentation, I can either press F5, I can go ahead and click\non the start slideshow from the beginning, from the slideshow tab. I can also click on the slideshow icon\nhere as well, so whichever one you want to, I'll click on the slideshow tab\nand I'll run this from the beginning. There's the shortcut right there. F five to start the show\nfrom the first slide. So here's my slide that I animated. Really nice slide. Everything is nicely\naligned there as well. Here's my table. Here's my Excel table. Here's my chart. Here's my Excel chart. Here's lesson eight. And then that's the end of\nthe slideshow here as well. Let's add a transition. I'll click on transitions here. And the transitions basically allow us\nto have some kind of entrance effect as we go from one slide to the next. So I'll choose a There's\na lot of transitions here. I want you to go ahead and try them all. And choose the ones that you like. Some are very simple,\nsome are very complex. If we scroll down, we can see we\ncan even have the previous slide folding into the shape often. origami bird here. So lots of transitions that we can use. I tend to stick to the simple\nones, something like wipe or push. I like the push transition. That's what it looks like. Almost like you're scrolling\nthrough a endless web page. If I use the wipe, this is like\nyou're kind of reading a book, turning the pages as well. I'll go ahead and choose\nthe push transition. And now, after I, after I've\nchosen the push transition, what I want to do, I want to make sure\nto apply it to all of my slides. Right, so I'll click on apply\nto all, because right now, if I were to run this slideshow, so I can see, it only applies the\ntransition for the first slide. So what I'll do is, I'll click on apply\nto all, Make sure that's checked off. And let's test that here. There we go. So it's pushing down to each slide. So pretty nice. I'll press escape to\nexit the slideshow here. And here we go. So that is pretty much how that works. Let's go ahead and animate our chart. So let's go ahead and click on\nthe chart that we inserted here. So I'll click on the chart. Let's go to animations, and\nlet's use the wipe animation. I want to show you\nsomething pretty cool here. So notice if I apply an animation\nto the chart, the entire chart comes in all at once. That's not really helpful. It would be nice if I can have the chart\ncome in, you know, kind of one by one, like maybe M Jones total first, and\nthen J Power, and so forth and so on. Well, let's take a look\nand see what we can do. Depending on the animation that\nyou choose, sometimes you will have effect options, which means you can\ndetermine how the animation works. Well, let's take a look at this. If I click on effect options\nhere, again, this is for my chart. So by default, it's\ncoming in as one object. Let's see what happens if I\nchoose to come in by series. Look at that. That's pretty cool. So it's coming in by quarter one, then\nquarter two, and then quarter three. We preview that again. Pretty nice. The other effect option is by category. So there we have the sales rep, M. Jones, and then J. Power, E. Cohen, and then R. Gupta. I'll try one more. Now we're going one by one in\nsequence, which is pretty cool. So we do have options when it comes\nto animating our chart as well. We don't have the same for our\ntables though, but we can do it for our chart here as well. So very good. So go ahead and just run\nthrough your slideshow. Go ahead and apply a transition. Make sure to apply it\nto all of your slides. Choose the one that you like. Go ahead and add an\nanimation for your chart. Go ahead and choose one\nof the effect options. Five to choose from. And come right back and we'll take\na look at the morph transition. Welcome back. Now let's finish up lesson 8 by\ntalking about the morph transition. So if I click over here on the\ntransitions tab, I can see that I have the morph transition. This is a pretty nice transition, really\nadds some nice flair, um, and some dynamic content to your presentation here as well. Let's go ahead and take a look and see\nwhat the morph transition is all about. I want to discuss three different\nplanets, Saturn, Mars, and Earth. But when I want to emphasize Earth, I want\nEarth to appear bigger than the others. And when I'm finished discussing\nEarth, I want to focus on Saturn. So Saturn will get bigger. and my other two here will get smaller. It's going to appear as if I'm\nstill working on one slide. As you can see down here, I\nhave one, two, three slides. Let's go ahead and run the presentation\nand let's see what this looks like. I'll go to reading mode here. Okay, so here's my slide. I'm getting ready to discuss\nthese three different planets. If I click next, so look at that. So earth kind of morphs into shape. increasing in size while Saturn and\nMars morphs into a smaller shape. While I'm finished discussing\nEarth, let's focus on Saturn now. So I want Saturn to increase in size\nwhile Mars and Earth decreases in size. So if I click next to go to the next\nslide, still appears I'm on the same slide but things are just kind of\nmorphing into shape here as well. So that is the morph transition. So pretty, pretty cool. So, let's go ahead and\nwork on this together. First, I want you to go ahead, go\nahead and insert three text boxes, and go ahead and insert three icons. So, just click on the Insert\ntab, go ahead and insert an icon, and we have one for Saturn, we have one for Mars, and we have one So, go ahead and insert those\nthree icons, and insert those three text boxes, like this. Right now, in terms of size, I\nhave my icons are all about 2. 58 high and wide as well. So go ahead and add those six\nobjects and come right back. Let's go ahead and apply\nthe morph transition. So it's a three step process\nif we hover over the morph. It tells us the first thing we\nneed to do is duplicate a slide. And that's it. And then step two, on the duplicated\nslide, just move things around. And then step three, apply\nthe morph transition. So let's go ahead and do that. We already have our slide. This is what it looks like. So I'll go ahead and duplicate this slide. To duplicate a slide, we can click\non the slide here on the left pane. If we right click on it,\nwe can choose the type. Duplicate slide command. We can also press ctrl D and\nthat will duplicate it for us. Okay, so here's the original slide\nand here's the duplicated slide. So let's focus on the duplicated slide. So for here, I'm simply\ngoing to resize things. So for my two, for Saturn and Mars, I\nwant to decrease these to one, one by one. So for the height, I'll just do that. That takes care of that. For earth, I want this to grow to four. So I'll type four here. So again, just click on the icon on the\ngraphics format and the size command group, just type a number for the\nheight and it makes it four by four. Going to increase the\nwidth of my text box here. So it's just a little\nbigger and that's about it. I want to keep it simple. Don't want to do too much. So I do want to be able to\nduplicate this slide as well. I want to keep it going because on the\nnext slide I want to make everything else smaller and increase the size of Saturn. So all we're doing right now\non the duplicated slide, we're just following the steps. We're moving things around. resizing them. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthis slide as well. So I've duplicated the duplicated slide. And for this one, I'll put the, put\nthis back to one inch for Earth. I'll fix my text box here as well. And then for Saturn, I'll\nincrease the size to four. There we go. Now I have to kind of move things around. I'll move this to the left a little bit\nso it's not overlapping with my Mars here. And I'll increase the size\nof the text box as well. And there we go. So the transition from slide, from this\nslide to this one is going to be morph. And the transition from this slide to\nmy last one is also going to be morph. So what I'll do is I'll click on\nthat second to last slide, and I'll click on the morph transition. Here's a nice little preview\nof what it would look like. I'll go to my last slide, and I'll also\napply the morph transition as well. I don't want to apply the morph\ntransition for my first slide, because there's nothing to morph yet. So I'm just morphing. my two duplicated slides here as well. So let's run this in reading mode. See what this looks like. So here's my slide. If I click next in the sequence, there it is. My earth and my text box is growing. Everything else shrinks. And there we go. So pretty, pretty cool. Now I could even move things around. In this case, I just resized them, but I\ncould have actually moved things around. And we will see it\nmorphing into its shape. Let's actually do one more. I'll go ahead and duplicate this one. And let's move them around this time. So right click, I'll go\nahead and duplicate this one. Because I duplicated it, it\nautomatically inherits the morph transition, so no need to do that. And on this last slide here, I'm going\nto go ahead and move things around. So I'll go ahead and, let's\nsee, maybe I'll, I'm going to make this smaller actually. Don't need that to be that big. There we go, I'm going to resize this\njust to make a little room for my other items here as well. Maybe what I'll do is I'll\ngo ahead and stagger these. So Saturn will be here. Mars will be here. And Earth is going to\nbe down here somewhere. And I'll put everything back to one inch. Not perfect, but we just want to\ngo ahead and kind of see how this transforms into here as well. So let's go back. This time I'll run it in slideshow view. Okay, so here's the first slide. Here's our first morph. Our second morph. And let's see what our\nthird morph looks like. Pretty, pretty cool. So everything is moving into,\ninto shape here as well. Alright, very good. So go ahead and run the morph transition. Go ahead and duplicate\nas many as you like. What I've seen a lot of professionals\ndo, They morph a few times and come back to the original slide as the last slide. So you can do that if you want to\nand come back and we'll wrap up. Welcome back. Well, hopefully you had fun\nwith the morph transition. The next thing to do here is\nto print our presentation. If we do decide to print it via paper,\nwe can press control plus P and that will open up the print dialog for us. I'll go ahead and press control P. Here's the print dialog. Here's the true preview of what, of\nwhat the printouts would look like as long as we're using a color printer\nand I can scroll through my slides. I can see what they look like and I\ncan make any changes if I need to. So we have all the basic print dialogue\nsettings that we need to be able to use. If you do have the Microsoft printer PDF\nprinter, we can actually save this as a PDF file and that we can distribute. That's a good idea. Maybe your recipient does not\nhave a copy of Microsoft Office. Any modern browser can read a PDF as well. So, very good. I'm going to go back here,\nand we're good to go. Now, we covered a lot here in this\nintroductory course, and we have all the essentials that we need\nto create a dynamic presentation. As a quick recap, we're able to, in Module\n1, understand the PowerPoint interface, we're able to design a presentation,\nwe're able to insert and format text, spend some time inserting and formatting\nimages, then for Module 2, we're able to work with objects, grouping,\naligning, inserting and manage tables. charts as well. Then we're able to take a look\nat different types of animations and transitions as well. So congratulations on completing the\ncourse and I look forward to seeing all of you in a future course at LearnIt. Hello and welcome to\nMicrosoft PowerPoint Advanced. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. For our advanced course, we have two\nmodules, so module three and module four. For Module 3, we'll take a look at how we\ncan customize the PowerPoint environment. We'll take a look at how we\ncan customize design templates. It's all about the Slide Master. We'll save a design as a template\nthat we can either share or reuse over and over again. We'll also go ahead and take a look at\ncreating infographics with SmartArt. No need to search the\nweb for infographics. We can make our own. There's an extensive library\nof capabilities right here inside of Microsoft PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and dive in. Please open up the PowerPoint Module\n3 exercise file and come right back. We'll dive right into customizing\nthe PowerPoint environment. I currently have my module\nthree practice file open here, and here we have a few slides. And here is lesson one,\ncustomizing the environment. So one of the things that we'll\ndo is we'll go ahead and create our own ribbon tab, and then\nwe'll add our own commands to it. And then we'll also go ahead and set\nsome global options, just some useful options that may help us as well. In particular, what I would like to do\nis add some of these tools that will help me as I'm designing my presentation,\nsuch as the animation pane, the beloved eyedropper, the selection pane that\nhelps us to organize objects on a slide, and of course the slide master. So to do that, right now, in order\nto get to the eyedropper, I could add it to my quick access toolbar. That's one thing that I can do, or I\nneed to be interacting with an object, and then I can go ahead and pull up\nthe eyedropper from there as well. But what if I don't feel like clicking\non the contextual tab, clicking on shape fill, and clicking on the eyedropper? Well, let's go ahead and\nadd our own ribbon tab. We're going to right click on any one\nof these tabs, and just click on the option that says customize the ribbon. So I'll click on customize the ribbon. We get to this PowerPoint options\ndialog, and on the left we can see that we can customize the ribbon. Here are all the commands, well,\nat least the popular commands. I'm going to change this to all commands. So I'll change this to all commands. Now I can see all the commands\nthat are in PowerPoint. Over here on the right, I can\nsee that I have some, I can see the tabs that I have here. So, for example, here's the Home tab, and\nthe Home tab has the Clipboard command group, Paragraph, so forth and so on. Well, I want to create my own. As you can see, I do have a couple\nof pre made ones here as well. So, for example, I created\na tab called My Designs. And let's see what that looks like here. So when I created this tab, it comes\nwith a tab and then a command group. And then I have my\ncommands down here as well. I'm going to turn this on. Let's see what this looks like here. And then we'll go ahead and recreate it. So if I enable that, I'll go ahead\nand find it here on my ribbon. Here it is, my designs. So now if I click on my designs, I\ncan quickly access the animation pane. I can turn on the eyedropper right away\nand apply a particular color to that content placeholder there, if I want to. And I can also turn on the selection\npane, take a look at all the different objects on my slide. I can also access the slide\nmaster right from here as well. So that's what we can do. So let's go ahead and create our own. Let's go back to\ncustomize the ribbon here. And to do that, the first thing we need\nto do is click on the new tab option here. So we'll click on new tab. So here is our new tab right here. Has a generic name, new tab. It has a generic command group. Let's go ahead and rename both of those. So for the new tab, I'll click on rename. Maybe I'll call that design 24. Go ahead and press OK. And for the command group,\nI'll rename that as well. Click on rename. You can also choose an\nicon if you want to. We'll go ahead and choose this\nhere in the display name, it's going to be called design tools. Go ahead and press okay. So I'm good to go. I have my design tab. Here's my command group. The next thing for me to do is to\ngo ahead and actually add commands to that particular command group. So I want to make sure I have\ndesign tool selected here, and I'll change the commands from\npopular commands to all commands. So now what I can do is\nI can type the letter E. This will bring me down to the E commands. I want to look for the eyedropper. Here it is. I'll add the eyedropper in there\nso we can see how this works. So here's level one,\nwhich is the actual tab. level two, which is the command group. And then we have level three,\nwhich is the actual command. So let's go ahead and add some more. I'm going to go ahead\nand add the slide master. So I'll type the letter S and I'll\nlook for the slide master here. And again, you can pretty much add\nany, any command that you want. I'll just click on slide master. I'll also turn on the selection pane. And here we go. I'll add that. And I'll keep it simple. I'll just add one more. I'll go back to the A group and\nI'll add the animation pane. And I'm good to go. Here are my four commands. I'll press OK. And I'll go ahead and locate design 24. Here it is right here. And from here I can go ahead and I could\neven create another command group, name that, and add my own commands in here\nas well, and I can keep going as well. So that's what we want to do. So go ahead and customize your\nribbon, go ahead and create a ribbon tab, rename the command group, go\nahead and add some commands there as well, and come right back. Now that we are able to create\nour own tab, so here are my two tabs here, The next thing we can\ndo is turn on some useful options. I'll go back here. I'll right click on any of\nthese ribbon tabs and I'll go back to customizing the ribbon. This brings me to the\nPowerPoint options dialog here. So I'll go back to the general here and\nsome of these are turned on by default, but I find these to be pretty helpful\nwhen you're designing your presentation. So the first tab here on the general tab. I can see that I have some\nuser interface options. Now, if you're using two monitors, you may\nnotice that when you move your application from one window to the next, You may\nhave some appearance issues here as well. So you may want to go ahead and\noptimize for best appearance when you're using multiple displays. If you just kind of hover over the\nlittle information icon, it gives you some more information here as well. So you can toggle it back and\nforth, optimize for compatibility or optimize for best appearance. I like the mini toolbar on selection. This is. Pretty much whenever you highlight a chunk\nof text, it gives you the mini tool that allows you to do some quick formatting. A big part of designing in\nPowerPoint is live preview. So, for example, before we apply\na particular style or some type of feature, we can get a preview\njust by hovering the mouse over it. So I like to leave that\nturned on there as well. For those of us who like to collapse\nthe ribbon, remember we can always change the ribbon display options. I like to see the full\nribbon, so I'm good to go. You may want to collapse\nthe Microsoft search box. As you can see, I do have it over here. It is currently minimized, and this\nallows me a little more room if I'm using my quick access toolbar. I have some more room over\nhere to work with as well, so I can do that if I want to. I'll scroll down a little bit. Here's the PowerPoint designer. So when you're designing, you're\neither using a theme, you're using the slide master, or you're\nusing the PowerPoint designer. I have it turned off right now because\nI'm going to be using the slide master to design my presentation as well. If we go down to the save, go\ndown to the preserve fidelity when sharing this presentation. If you're using special fonts in your\npresentation, if your recipient does not have that particular font or set of fonts,\nthey will not be displayed properly. So you may want to embed the fonts in\nthe file so that even though they don't have those fonts installed, they will\nstill be able to view them as well. So that's another nice option\nto be able to use there. The other ones here. in terms of advanced. When it comes to printing, we can\nprint true type fonts as graphics. So that's another nice option\nthere as well, um, that we can use. And of course, if we go to the\nquick access toolbar here, just like how we can add any command to\nthe, the ribbon tab that we created, here are the current commands that\nare on my quick access toolbar. But I do have access\nto the entire library. So if I change this to all\ncommands, I can add any command to my quick access toolbar. And because I minimize the search\nbox here, I have a lot of room over here to be able to add\nsome of those commands as well. So those are just some options\nthat may help you as you continue to create designs in PowerPoint. Let's move on to lesson two,\ndesigning with the slide master. Now, what is the slide master? Let's go ahead and take a\nlook at the slide master. To get there, I need to go ahead\nand click on the view tab and get to the actual slide master. Once I'm there, I can do\nsomething like insert a layout. I can rename a layout and I can\ninsert content placeholders as well. Let's do something simple\nin the slide master. Let's go ahead and make universal\nchanges to our entire presentation. For example, we often\ndo this for each slide. Maybe we want to go ahead\nand change the title. Maybe we want to go ahead and do\nsomething like change the font. I'll go for this one and change the color\nand then go ahead and change the size. We go to our next slide. We do the same thing. Well, we don't have to do that. Instead of going to every single slide\nand changing the formatting options for all of our title placeholders,\nwe can do that in the Slide Master. So, I'm going to go ahead\nand undo all those changes. I'll press CTRL Z a few times here. Now I'm back to normal. Let's head on over to the Slide Master. I'll click on the View tab and And once\nI'm on the View tab, all the way to the far left, we'll see the Slide Master. Let's hover over the Slide\nMaster and see what it says. So Slide Master, it controls the look\nof your entire presentation, including colors, fonts, backgrounds, effects,\nand just about everything else. So I can insert a shape or a\nlogo, and it will show up on all of my slides automatically. Well, that sounds pretty good. Let me go ahead and click\non the Slide Master here. Now here we can notice that\nwe have a different view. Now we are in the Slide Master view. We can see that we now have the\nSlide Master tab, and we have some command groups here that\nare specific to our Slide Master. Now important to note, on the left,\nwe'll have different types of slides. What I want to do is scroll\nall the way to the top here. And you'll notice all the way at the\nvery top, we'll notice that a slide is bigger than all of our other slides. So in fact, this is the\nactual slide master. The other slides that we see here,\nthese are the different layouts. So here's the title and content layout. Here's the two content layout. Here's the comparison layout. So that's what that is. I'm going to go ahead and click\non the actual slide master here. And let's just get a good\nunderstanding of how this works. So whatever changes I make to this slide,\nit's going to affect all of my slides regardless of what type of layout it is. So I'm just going to do something simple. I'll go ahead and run it. I want all of my title slides to be\na particular font, color, and size. So I'll go ahead and highlight these,\nI'll go back to the Home tab, and I'll go ahead and apply the formatting there. Once we apply the formatting, we'll close\nthe Slide Master and take a look and see how our slides have been updated. Okay, I'll change this font here. I'm going to go with the Georgia font. Alright, so here's Georgia, and I\nwant it to be that nice Georgia blue, and I'll make it 40, and that's it. Now if you take a look, you'll notice,\ntake a look at my different layouts. So here's the title slide, we can see that\nthe title slide is already incorporating that formatting that I just applied. Here's the title and content slide layout. And we can see it's also\nincorporating that format that I've made to the slide master. Let's go back to the slide master. Let's go ahead and close the master view. This will put our presentation back\nto the original or normal view. And let's take a look to see\nif our slides were updated. And we can see that they were. So here's my title slide. Here's slide number two. So all of my slides now have that\nuniversal formatting for my title. Let's take it a step further. Let's go back into the Slide Master. And let's see what else we can do here. Again, I want to make sure I\nclick on that very top slide here. And what I'm going to do is\nfor all of my level, I want to change my bullets actually. I want to highlight these\nfive bullet levels here. And I'll go to the Home tab. And instead of having those\nregular bullets, maybe I want something like hollow squares. So I'll go ahead and\nchoose hollow squares. And for my level one item, maybe I\nwant that to be, let's say, orange. My level two item is on the list. Maybe I want that to be,\nwe'll go with purple. And that's it. Let's go ahead and analyze our\nslides and see if it incorporates these formatting changes. I'll go back to the Slide Master,\nI'll click on Close Master View. And look at that! All of my Level 1 bullet points\nare orange, and it has the hollow squares here as well. If I go back to slide number 2,\nwe can see all of those formatting changes have been applied here. The title, Georgia 40 Blue. Level 1, orange with the hollow squares. Level 2 bullet items, or list items,\npurple with the hollow square as well. So those are some of the universal changes\nthat we can make with the slide master. Now just one more thing to note, I'll\ngo back into the slide master here. So I have two options. What I did initially is\nI chose the master slide. So this applies the formatting\nto every single slide. What if I only wanted\nto make some changes? Let's see if I hover over this one. So this is title and content. It's currently being used\nby slides 2 to 3 and 5 to 7. So if I wanted to format only\nthis particular slide layout, I can do that here as well. So for my third level here,\nI'll go ahead and make this, uh, let's see, I'll make this green. Like that. It's only going to affect the title. my title and content layout. So let's go back here. I'll close the master view. And so this is a, let's see, lesson\none, this is a title and content. Let's add a third level item. And there you go. We can see that it's already, it's already green. If I go to a another layout, let's see,\ndo I have a two content layout in here? Well, let's just insert a\ntwo content layout slide. Okay, so here's level one. Here's level two. And here's level three. So we can see that level three item only\napplies to that particular type of slide. So we can either make universal\nchanges to the entire presentation or to specific slides as well. Go ahead and make some simple\nchanges in the slide master. Thank you. and preview it and come right back. Let's continue fun with the slide master. Well, what I want to do now is\ncreate a custom slide layout. If I click on new slide here, here are\nthe different layouts that are available based on the current theme that I'm using. Now, I don't have the particular\nlayout that I'm looking for. Basically, what I want is\na three content layout. So I have title and content. I have two content. I want a slide that has three columns. That way I can easily express\nthree concepts or three main keys or three main ideas here. So I don't have one. So what I can do is create my own layout. Let's go ahead and do that. I'll click on the view tab here\nand I'll click on the slide master. Now I have two options. I can either just kind of duplicate an\nexisting slide and just make a basic update or I can insert a new layout. I'll keep it simple. I'll use it based on the\ntwo content layout here. So in the slide master, I'll\nclick on the two content layout. So we have two content\nhere, but I want three. So what I'm going to do is duplicate the\nslide and just resize these placeholders. and place one here in the middle. So I'm going to right click on\nthis layout and I'll choose the duplicate layout option here. I can see it's duplicated. It's the exact replica of the one above. So on the duplicated layout,\nI want to rename it first. So we'll duplicate it, rename it, and\nthen we'll go ahead and format it. So I'll right click on it. I'll choose rename. I can also click right here to rename it. I'll right click. I'll rename. I'll call this one three content. I'll press rename and I'm good to go. So now what I can do, I can\njust go ahead and resize these. So I'll go ahead and grab the\ncontent placeholder on the left here and just going to resize it. I do have the footers down here\non the bottom, so I'll make sure it's the same width as my footers. The one on the right, I'll grab the\nresize handle and I'll snap it to that footer on the bottom right here. Now I have space in the\nmiddle to put a, a bigger one. I could resize them, make them all\nthe same size if I want to, but I'll just insert one here in the middle. So to do that, I'll click on\nwhere it says Insert Placeholder. So under the Master Layout\ncommand group, under the Slide Master, I'll insert a placeholder. Now here are the different\nplaceholders that we can insert. The content, basically,\nwe can add anything. Text, picture, chart,\ntable, smart art, media. Text is just for text only. picture, chart, table. Well, I want a content placeholder\nthat can pretty much add anything. So I'll click on content. And just like a text\nbox, I have to draw it. So I'll go ahead and draw it here. We can always resize it later. Right now, I just want to use those\ntemporary guides to make sure they're the same height as the other two. And I'll snap this right here. And I think I'd like to\ngo ahead and center align. my title as well. So there we go. Let's go ahead and close the master view. Let's go ahead and insert\nthis slide and let's see what this slide layout looks like. So now how do I find it? If I click on new slide, I can see\nhere is my three content layout. So pretty, pretty cool. So now I can always use this\nslide layout whenever I want to. I'll go ahead and insert that here. And there it is. So I can add my title and I have\nmy content placeholder here on the left, middle and on the right. So pretty, pretty nice as well. Go ahead and create a\nthree content layout. Go ahead and insert it into your\npresentation and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead for lesson two. Let's go ahead and create a custom slide\nthat we can use over and over again. I'm going to head on\nover to my title slide. Now I did insert a\nimage on my title slide. The reason I do that is because I want\nto gain some insights from the designer. So the designer really likes pictures. So if you add an image to your slide,\nit'll get some more vibrant looking. options here as well. I'm not going to insert any of them. I just want to get some insights\nin terms of what is modern and what looks pretty cool. So we can see it tends to put either a\nbig picture left, big picture right, or even a big picture on the top, and then\nadd our title and subtitle here as well. So these look pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate an actual slide. Let's see, see more designs. Now we can see if we actually break\ndown this particular slide here. So how can we recreate a slide like this? This slide, basically we have a picture. We have what looks like a, either\na shape or a text box here. We have a triangle\nshape down here as well. That's pretty much what these are. They're a combination of\ncontent placeholders, images, and different types of shapes. Now, when you create a custom\nslide in the Slide Master, when you actually insert that slide, you will\nnot be able to interact with the picture or any of the other elements. objects that you insert on there. Let's go ahead and head on\nover to the slide master. I'll close the designer here. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to slide master. Now, what I want to do is I want\nto go ahead and insert a layout. If I hover over that tells\nme that I can add a custom layout to the master slide set. Once it's created, I can easily\nadd slides that match the new layout to my presentation. Well, I'll go ahead and\nclick on Insert Layout here. And we can see that it\ninserted a new layout for us. All it has on here is just the title. It's blank. We have the, the footers\ndown here as well. Date, custom message,\nand page number in here. I'm going to rename this right away. Again, I want this to be a\ncustom title slide that I can reuse over and over again. So I'll right click on here\nand I'll rename this layout and I'll call this one title two. And there we go. So I'm going to I think what I will\nwant is a big picture on the top and then I want my title on the\nbottom right and then my subtitle. Maybe I'll go ahead and add\na logo over here as well. So that's what I'll do. So to do that, I'll go ahead\nand click on the insert tab. I'll look for a stock image, and I\nwant something related to learning. I know exactly the picture\nI want, so I'll scroll down. Here it is. Nice chalkboard here. Beautiful colors that are in here. I'll go ahead and insert that one. You can insert any picture you want. So this picture is\nactually very, very good. It actually takes up the entire slide. Sometimes you insert a picture and\nit's more fit to either align it to the left or to align it to the top. So I do want to, what I'm going\nto do is crop this picture because I don't have any space down here. I do not want to overlay the text on it. So I'm going to cut out the picture. I don't want to cut\nout the chairs, though. They look really nice. I'll cut out, maybe I'll crop\nthe bottom and just a little bit from the top here as well. That will give me a little bit of\nroom to be able to add my title, subtitle and my logo as well. So I'll click on the picture format and\nI'll click on the cropping tool here. There we go. And I'll crop it from\nthe bottom to about here. And I'll come down to about here. I'll click away from it. There we go. I'll move it up to the top here. Now that's pretty good. I could probably even crop it a little\nmore, but I'll keep it simple here. Now I want to go ahead and find my title. So my title is hiding behind my pictures. If I move my picture,\nI'll see my title there. So what I'll do is turn\non the selection pane. I can click on Picture Format\nand turn on the Selection Pane. I also have it under my Designs here,\nso I'll just turn on the Selection Pane. I'll go ahead and locate my title. And once I have it selected,\nI can use the arrow keys on my keyboard to just move it down. I can also just bring it forward. If I want to. But for now, I'll just go ahead and\nmove it down here to the bottom. I do want to align it to the right,\nso I'll bring it to the right here. Doesn't need to be that big either. Maybe I'll go to about\nthe middle of the slide. And as far as the text, I'll make that 32. And I'll also Bring it up here as well. I'm going to turn off my footers. So if I go back to the Slide Master,\nI can toggle the footers off here. I'm just going to turn them off for now. I don't really need them right now. But that's pretty much how you would\ninsert footers from the Slide Master. So here we go. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert another placeholder. This will be for my subtitle. So I want a text placeholder. I'll draw it down here. This is going to be just a level one item. So I'll delete all of\nthe other levels here. And this is not a bulleted list. I'll use my quick toolbar\nhere to remove the bullets. And as far as the text, I want to pick up\none of the colors from the picture here. So I'll use the eyedropper. And I'll pull on the color here as well. So I'm good to go. That looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and align\nthis a little more. Alright. Now I'll go ahead and insert\na I'll insert an icon. Something to do with I'll go ahead and grab this one. So this is another type of object. And this one is giving me issues as well. So I'll click on the graphic. I'll use my arrow keys to\nkind of move that around here. And maybe what I'll do\nis align that to the To the bottom, and then to the left here. I'm good to go. If I wanted to do something else, like\nadd a little accent, I can do that. So, I'll just insert a shape to\nkind of show what that looks like. I'll, um, put a little, let's see. Let me just a line. I'll draw a line right through here. There we go. All right, that looks pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and\nclose these, the slide master. And let's go ahead and insert that. So I'll click on new slide. And here's my title two. If I insert that, that's\nwhat it looks like. And it looks pretty good. So if I wanted to make any\nchanges, I can simply go back into the slide master, click on\nthis slide and move things around. But here I can go ahead and add My\ncontent and I'll say community day. I'll say something like learn with us as well. Notice I cannot interact with the icon\nhere or that line shape or that picture. The only things I can interact\nwith are the content placeholders. So when you're designing, if you add\nany shapes or images or any objects that remain flat on the canvas. which makes it possible for us to create\nthese types of designs here as well. Go ahead and create a custom title,\nmake any changes if you need to. For example, if I wanted to go ahead\nand go back to the slide master. So if I wanted to maybe\nalign my text to the right, and once I close the master view\nand go back, I can see now it's aligned to the right as well. Go ahead and insert a\ncustom title, slide or two. Go ahead and insert it\nand come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number three, customizing design templates. Now, when you're creating a template\nin PowerPoint, typically you're saving a couple of slide layouts. You're also creating and saving\na theme and a design as well. We want to go ahead and lock in the\nlayouts that we've created so far. So, if we click on new slide, Here's\nour title, our custom title slide, and here's our three content layout as well. But what if we wanted to make some other\nchanges, such as change the color scheme that's available, and maybe change\nthe font for the entire presentation? I did apply the Georgia\nfont to all of my titles. We can see it's Georgia. But for everything else, it's the default. font style here for PowerPoint. So what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and create my own theme by choosing my own colors and fonts. And then we'll go ahead and\nsave this as a template. I'll head on over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab,\ngo back to slide master. So at this point, what I want\nto do, I want to go ahead. I can either choose a theme\nSo let's preview those first. If I click here and I simply choose one\nof these themes, I can see how the theme will update all of my slides for me. But what if I'm not finding\na theme that I want? What if I want to use my\nown colors and my own fonts? Typically, that's what we\nwill do in the slide master. I'll click on the colors here,\nand you can see I have some different pals to choose from. So depending, maybe I'm trying\nto brand this presentation and I want a particular color set. I can go ahead and choose one of\nthese existing ones here as well. Additionally, if I want to, I\ncan even take it a step further. I can create my own color palette. The way to do that is by\nclicking on customize colors. Once you're here, we just need to go\nahead and name it and go ahead and choose all these colors that we want. So this is typically where you\nwould put your company colors to be able to brand the presentation. Once you do that, it will\nappear in the custom area. And as you can see, I have a\ncouple of color palettes here. Okay. Right now, just want to\nchoose an existing palette. And I'm going to go ahead and I'll\nchoose, I'll go with the blue two. So I've chosen my color set. Now, every time I want to\nmodify something, I'll see that those colors are now available. I want to choose my own font as well. So I'll go ahead and click on fonts. And I want to use the Georgia\nfont, not just for this particular slide, but all of my slides. So I'll scroll down to, I don't\nhave Georgia here, I'll click here. And we can see everything now is Georgia. If I go back to my slide master here,\nI can see it's Georgia here as well. So basically I chose my own color palette. I chose my own font. If I want to, I can even add a, an effect. I'll go for a glossy effect. These effects, they're very subtle. They appear in things like charts and\ntables and other types of visuals. Not really for text here as well. So that's it. So from here, what I can do is\nI can go ahead and lock all this in by saving this as a template. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the file tab. Then I'll go ahead and click on save as, and I can do it there if I want to, or\nI can press the F12 key on my keyboard. Now once I'm here, what I need to do\nis simply change the presentation type. So I want to save the type. Not as a PowerPoint presentation,\nbut as a PowerPoint template. So I'll click on this drop down first. I'll scroll down to PowerPoint template. Here it is. Now notice when I change this to a\ntemplate save type, it automatically jumps to the folder, the default\nfolder that houses all of my custom office templates here as well. So we don't want to change that location. The only thing we want to do is go\nahead and rename it and press save. So I'll go ahead and\nleave this as the name. I'll press save. And that's it. So this has been saved as a template. The next time I open PowerPoint,\nright from my start screen, I can see that template. And now I'll have all of the colors,\nfonts, effects, slide layouts, custom slides, any changes that I've made\nwill be locked into the template. I'm going to go ahead and\nclose the master view. Then the next thing to do is to\nbe able to find our templates. I'll click on the file tab here and you'll\nnotice it appears right here on your recent files from the home button there. So what I like to do is that I like\nto go ahead and pin it right away. So it will always show up on my pin files. I'll go ahead and pin that. There we go. So now it's pinned. If I click on my pin files,\nI can see it in here. It's right here. So I can always access that file. The traditional way to access your\ntemplates is to click on the new tab here. And when you go down, we'll notice\nthat we have office templates. So this is from Microsoft's gallery. We want custom. So if I have existing templates, click\non the new tab, click on custom, and then I'll have my custom office templates. If I click right here, Here\nare the different templates. Here's the recent one that I created. And basically the way that this\nworks is, if I were to open this file, PowerPoint will produce a\ncopy of that presentation for me. The original template will\nremain untouched here as well. So that's the benefit of\nworking with a template. We can reuse it over\nand over and over again. If we want to make any changes to the\ntemplate, we can go ahead and open it from the folder structure on our computer. And make any changes and re\nsave it and that template will be updated here as well. So go ahead and go back\ninto the Slide Master. Go ahead and choose a color scheme. Choose a font. Go ahead and save your presentation as\na template and just confirm that you can see it in your custom templates folder. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to\nlesson four, creating infographics. We're going to create smart art, and then\nwe will go ahead and modify smart art. And once we're finished, we'll Have the\ncapability to animate smart art as well. Now, what exactly is smart art? Smart art is a way of creating\ninfographics in Microsoft PowerPoint, so really there's no need to\nsearch the web for an infographic. We have an extensive library in\nPowerPoint that you can use to create your own infographics. We want to get to this library of\nsmart art graphics that we can create. We can see that we have different. Sections such as if you want to\nexpress an infographic as a list, a process, a cycle, so forth and so on. What we'll talk about is how we can\nconvert smart art from existing content, and we'll also take a look at how we can\ngo ahead and insert a smart art graphic and then add our own content to it. So an infographic is basically text. accompanied by either shapes or images. So in this example, I have a basic\nlist here, just step one, step two, and step three, very generic. We're going to convert this\ninto an infographic and we'll watch it evolve as we do that. So I can either express my steps\nhere in the form of a bulleted list as such, or what I can do, I'm going\nto go ahead and highlight my list. And then I'll use Microsoft to\nconvert this into an infographic. To do that, I need to first highlight\nmy My list, and on the home tab, in the paragraph command group here is smart art. If you hover over it tells you exactly\nwhat it does, converts text on your slide to a smart art graphic, such as a\ndiagram, flow chart, so forth and so on. If I click on the dropdown,\nI see just a short list. of infographics that I can create. For example, here's the first\none, a vertical bullet list. So as you can see, if I were to\nchoose this one, I'll get those really nice rounded rectangle\nshapes there to accompany my text. Here's another type, vertical block list. So we have smaller rounded rectangles. And if we wanted to add a picture to it,\nwe can go ahead and do that here as well. So lots of different. Graphics in here. It's time to explore and\nsee what is a available. Some of these are different. Here's an org chart. So if you want to create an\norganization chart, you can pretty much do that in PowerPoint. Here's another variation hierarchy. So we can express something as\na list, a hierarchy, a process. Cycle. So, lots of different\noptions that we can use here. We're going to go ahead and\nclick on more smart art graphics. Let's take a look at the library to\nget an understanding of what we can do. So, here's the full smart art library. And basically, PowerPoint is asking\nus to choose a smart art graphic. Well, we can choose whether we want to\nexpress something as a list, something as a cycle, or even as a matrix. So different ones here. When you click on the list. So in this case, I want to\nexpress something as a process. Step one, two, three. I have a basic process here. Here's a preview of what\nthis would look like. On the bottom, we have a brief explanation\nof how the SmartArt graphic works. Here's the second one, a step up process. We have a step down process here as well. Now when you're creating an\ninfographic, you can keep it very simple or you can make it more complex. So as we can see down here,\nwe have some more complex. infographics or smart art. And we can see that we have a more in\ndepth explanation of how this works. It's all based on levels. So when you're creating a list, it's all\nbased on level one, two, or three items. So different smart art graphics\nwill incorporate different levels. Some, some only allow one or two,\nsome will allow more than two as well. For, for relations, we can see\nwe have some really complex ones in here, such as a balance scale. And we have a lot of verbiage here,\nkind of explaining how that works. So what I'd like for you to do,\ngo ahead and highlight your text. And then go ahead and try out\nsome of the different smart arts. We can always change\nit once we select one. So if I select the vertical\nbullet list here, I can always change it a little later. So go ahead and check them out. If you're feeling adventurous, click\non the more smart art graphics here and take a look at the different options\nthat are available and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and create\nan infographic here. I'm going to go ahead and highlight\nmy text and go into, I'll start with a vertical bullet list here. Now, when you start with your smart\nart graphic, you'll notice that we have a smart art design contextual tab. So just like all of the other\nobjects, we can change the layout. We can change the style. So as you can see, we\nhave a white outline. We have a glossy effect\nhere, a shadowy effect. So there's a lot of different\nthings that we can do here. We can change the colors. And over here on the far left\nis where we can basically control our smart art graphics. So if we wanted to add another\nshape or move things around, we can do that as well. But I want to introduce you to our\nlittle text pane here on the left. And basically this is how I prefer\nto manage my smart art graphic. So again, it's based on the levels here. I only have level one items in here. If you're not seeing this text pane,\njust make sure to go ahead and click on this little arrow here, and this\nwill open up the text pane for you. So I'll click here, and there we go. If I wanted to do something like add\nanother step, I can just add another bullet there, and as you can see, it's\nalready adding that fourth shape for me. So if I say step four, I can do that as well. Now, if I continue working with the\nlist, if I press the enter key after step one, and I press tab over,\nso now I have a level two item. The level two item has its own\nNot really a shape, but just a small area here that we can use. So I'm going to keep it simple. I'm going to remove step 4. So I'll delete step 4 from my list. You'll notice the shape goes away. And for step 1, I'm just going\nto go ahead and put a level 2 item for each of my steps here. I'll keep it simple here. And as a matter of fact, if I\nalready had a bulleted list, I can copy and paste it in here. If I wanted to, and that will\nactually create the smart art graphic for me as well. But for here, I'll keep it simple. I'll just go with a Project\nmanagement template here. So I'll define the project\nStep two, I'll tab over and I'll say identify stakeholders. And for step number three,\nwe'll go ahead and add tasks. So that's how the smart art graphic works. So we have three here. So that's the simple way\nthat we can modify it. Now what I can do if you want to move\nthings around, well, what you can do is click on one of the shapes here and\non the smart art design tab over here on the far left, this is where we can\ndo things like move this down on the list, or we can move it up, or we can\npromote or demote, or we can add a shape. So we can either manage the list here\nto manage the smart art, Or we can use the create graphic command group\nto manage the smart art as well. So for example, if I wanted to move step\none down, notice how it moves the level one and the level two item down as well. I can go ahead and move that back up. And maybe I want to promote define\nproject as a level one item. So it does it here. And it gives, gives its own shape as well. I'll go ahead and demote that. And I'm good to go. So that's the basics of how we use\nthe text pane to modify SmartArt. Now, let's take a look\nat something else here. Let's click on the SmartArt design tab. And what if I want to change the colors? I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll click on the color palette here. And we have three options for the\nprimary colors based on the theme that we currently have selected. Just get the preview,\nsee what that looks like. We have five colorful\npalettes to choose from. So these are all incorporating\nthe accent colors based on the theme that you have selected. If I scroll down, we have different\nvariations of each accent color. So it's really up to you\nwhat you want to use. I typically like to use the\ncolorful scheme here as well. Once we change the colors, we can\nhead on over to smart art styles. And as you can see, there's a\nfew styles to choose from here. The first one gives a white outline\nand a little shadow as well. So it makes it look pretty nice. And then we have a subtle effect. Here's the moderate effect. And it gets more intense\nas we go to the right. So this one has a gloss\nand it also has a shadow. And we have polished. And it gets a little more interesting\nas we go through here as well. So different orientations\nof the SmartArt graphic. I'll go back. I'll just choose the\nmoderate effect here as well. So that is how we insert\nand modify SmartArt. Go ahead and create your own\nSmartArt graphic and come right back. In our last lesson, we saw how\nwe can create an infographic from existing content. Let's go ahead and move\non to the next slide. And this time we'll go ahead and insert\nSmartArt and then add our content. Now I can click on the SmartArt right\nhere inside of my content placeholder. That will insert my SmartArt for me. I can also click on the insert tab. And in the illustrations command group,\nhere's the smart art here as well. I'll go ahead and click on the\ninsert a smart art graphic right from my content placeholder. And again, here's the entire library\nof what we can go ahead and insert. I want to express something as a process. So, lots of different processes\nhere that I can, I can use. We can integrate pictures. in there as well. We'll get to pictures\nin just a little bit. Let's go ahead and keep it simple. I'll go ahead and insert\na step up process. I'll go ahead and press okay. So here's the shell of our smart art. Again, we have the smart art\ncontextual tab and over here we have our little text pane. Now what I can do, I can either\ntype the information in here or I already have the information I want. I'll go back to my other slide. I'll open up the text pane for this\nSmartArt graphic, and I'll just copy and paste this list right into here. So if you ever, if you already\nhave an existing list, you can simply copy and paste it in here. What I want to do first, though, is\npress CTRL A inside of my text pane here, and delete everything first, because\nif I paste it in, it's going to just append that to the existing SmartArt. So I'll go ahead and right click and I'll\ngo ahead and use the destination theme. And there is my SmartArt graphic. So all my levels are intact here as well. So that looks pretty good. But what if I want to go ahead and change\nthe SmartArt graphic to something else? I'll go ahead and click on the\nSmartArt design tab here and right over here under layouts. I'll get some similar layouts\nthat I can choose from. So I'll go ahead and maybe\nchoose this first one here. Here's the step down process. That's what that would look like. Here's the accent process. That looks pretty good as well. And here's the picture accent process. So this actually incorporates pictures. I'll go ahead and click on this one. And so now we're given another\nshape with a picture placeholder. So I'm going to go ahead\nand take it a step further. I'll use three images that kind of\ncommunicate, defining the project, identifying and tasks here as well. So to do that, I'll go ahead and\nclick on the placeholder either here or on my text pane here. Doesn't matter. I'll go ahead and click here. And I can either insert in a\npicture or I can use an icon. I prefer to use an icon because\nthey're always the same size, one inch by one inch pictures. We may need to crop the pictures to make\nthem fit inside of our smart art graphic. So I'll go ahead and grab an icon here. Here's my icon library. So I want something that\nrepresents defining. or yes, defining the project. So I'll search for, let's see targets. There you go. Like this graphic. I'll go ahead and choose this one. I'll choose the fill colored\none as opposed to the outline. So I'll go ahead and choose this here. Here's my graphic behind\nit for the next one. I'll look for a search icon, search or find And because we want to\ngo ahead and identify the stakeholders. So maybe I'll, maybe I'll use this one. A little hard to see it. Maybe I'll change that. And the last one should\nbe pretty simple to find. I'll just type tasks. I'll get a couple of\ntask lists here as well. I'll go for, I'll go for this one. That looks okay. Go ahead and insert that. So here are my three icons. I think I'm going to go ahead\nand change my second icon here. There we go. I'll have to first select it. Now I can right click on it and I\ncan change the graphic from icons. And I'll type find. Probably going to have the same issue. There we go. You know what? Let's see. Community. There we go. Maybe I'll go with this one. Identify stakeholders. And there we go. So that's how we can change the\nSmartArt graphic to another layout. And this is how we can integrate\npictures in here as well. Now, I want to make this look\na little nicer, so I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll give it a colorful,\na colorful palette here. There we go. So that looks pretty nice. Now I can, if I wanted to, I can make\nchanges to the individual objects here. So the arrow, all of these,\nI can go ahead and change. So if I wanted to go ahead and\nchange the color of this icon, notice that we have the graphics\nformat tab here that's available. And if I wanted to do that,\nI can simply go ahead and recolor it by applying a style. or giving it a different,\ndifferent graphic fill color. If I wanted to here, if I\nwanted a standard color, I can go ahead and do that as well. So that's what we can do. So we can change the color. We can have smart art, just kind\nof update the colors for us. I'll go ahead and give this a,\nI'll give this a white outline. That looks pretty nice. And now The beauty of this is once\nI have my smart art, if I want to go ahead and change, I can. So if I wanted to change this\ngraphic, it's a matter of just hovering over the different ones\nand see which one I like here. That looks pretty nice as well. Sometimes the, when you add a\npicture and you change the smart art, Any type of arrows will show\nup in the form of that picture. It's not really happening\nhere, but so pretty nice. Let's see. Are there any other picture of ones here? Here's another picture. So this is a ascending picture process. So there we go. Now, if I wanted to I can go ahead\nand just click on more layouts. This looks pretty nice. This gear icon here as well. I'll go ahead and click on more\nlayouts and I'll look for some of the other smart art graphics that\nare available in the picture command group and I'll take a look at those. So here's a another type here. I don't really like that. Not all these will work because\nagain some of them have their own type of requirements and they only\nallow certain amount of levels. So, it's just a matter of once you\nincorporate those pictures, choose the layout that you like and we're good to go. I'll go ahead and stick with this one and maybe I'll change\nthe colors here as well. And there we go. So, go ahead and insert your smart art. Go ahead and insert some\nicons or even some images. See what they look like\nand come right back. Welcome to Module 4. For Module 4, we'll go ahead and explore\nworking with media and animations. Video. Collaborating on a presentation. We'll customize our slideshow behavior. So what are some of the things\nthat we can kind of establish before we run our slideshow? And then we'll wrap up by using some of\nthe newer tools to automate animation. a slideshow. Go ahead and open up the module 4\npractice file and come right back. We'll dive right into module 4. Here's my module 4 practice file. I'll jump into slide number\n2, which is lesson 5. So for lesson 5, it's all\nabout working with media. We'll go ahead and insert\na local video file. And then we'll insert an\nonline video here as well. To insert media, we want to get\nto this media command group that can be found on the insert tab. And over here, we can insert videos\nfrom our device from the stock library. Also online videos, we'll take a\nlook at the different sources that we're able to stream videos from. When it comes to audio, you can either\nrecord your own audio, Using your microphone, or you can go ahead and upload\na audio file from your computer as well. And we also have the screen\nrecording tool, which we'll take a look at just a little bit here. I want to take advantage of the\ncontent placeholder here, and I'll insert my video by clicking on the\ninsert video content placeholder. So this allows me to basically upload\na video from my computer locally. So I'll go ahead and\ninsert this video here. And here is my video. Now, once we insert the\nvideo, we can resize it. It's an object, just like all of the other\nobjects that we've been interacting with. So as expected, we have a contextual tab. We actually have two. One is for video format\nand one is for playback. Well, if I click on video format, I can\ndo things like You know, choose a quick style, I can place it in an oval if I want\nto, or maybe give it a nice reflection. A simple shadow or just a\nsimple frame here as well. So I can do any of those things. Well, I want to go ahead and\njust run this slide and let's see what this actually looks like. So I'll go ahead and I'll\nrun this in reading mode. And I'll go ahead and play my video. So as we can see I can have some\nbasic controls here such as I can play it I can skim through it and I can\nalso adjust the Volume here as well. So this is kind of the\ndefault out of the box. Let's go ahead and make some\nFormatting changes to it here as well. I'll press escape come back here So\nif I click on here, remember the first thing I'll do I'll click on video format\nI'll go ahead and put this in a frame. Maybe I'll put it in a Go for this Rounded rectangle here. So put it in that frame. I can make it bigger if I want to as well. So I've placed it in a frame. And over here, I can go ahead\nand play it to get a nice preview of what it would look like. Just like with our image tools,\nI can go ahead and give it some corrections, make it brighter,\nor have more contrast as well. I can even recolor it if I want to. And we have some other pretty nice\ntools here as well, but that's about it for the video format. I just want to give it a quick style. I'll go to the playback here, and when\nwe click on the playback contextual tab, we can see that we have some editing\ntools here that we can use, such as trimming the video, fading in and out. And then we have some\nother video options here. This will basically establish how the\nvideo behaves once we get to the slide. Let's take a look at\nthe Trim Video feature. I'll click on Trim Video. And in this particular video, there was\na lot of white space in the beginning. So maybe I don't want to start. Maybe I want to start\nmaybe right about here. I'll start with that question. What brought you to LearnIt today? So maybe right about there. Right, so just by moving that\nslider, I'm starting at 14. 9 seconds here as well. At the end, I had a little,\nsome more space in here as well. Maybe I'll stop right here as\nsoon as the LearnIt logo appears. That's it. I can even use these little\narrows to kind of determine. the starting point. That helps a little better. I'll go ahead and press okay. And let's preview it. There you go. So it started with the question\nas opposed to starting from the very beginning there as well. All right. So I already trimmed the video. I'll go ahead and establish the volume. I'll make sure that the volume is medium. I don't want it to be\nhigh for my audience. And I want it to play automatically. So whenever I navigate to the slide, This\nwill play automatically here as well, and I want to play it in full screen mode. So I can go ahead and do\nthat, and I'm good to go. So let's go ahead and\nrun this in reading view. Let's see what this looks like. So there you go. So we can see that the volume has been set\nto medium, and it's playing in full screen here, and it also played automatically. So I'll go ahead and escape and\ngo back to my slide here as well. So go ahead and insert a video. Hopefully you have one. Go ahead and insert it. Take a look at the different\ntools under the video format tab and go ahead and trim the video. Make it start automatically and\nalso go ahead and play it full screen and come right back. In this segment, we'll go\nahead and insert online video. Now I'm actually going\nto insert a new slide. So I'll just press control\nM and start a new slide. I'll change this layout to title only. Because I want to insert a nice big\nonline video here from our YouTube site. So this will be an online video. So to insert an online video, if I click\non the insert tab, and here is video. So I have the option to insert video\nfrom the online stock videos, or I can grab from various sources here as well. I'll click on online videos, and\nwe'll kind of just preview what's available in the stock video library. I'll click on online videos here. And we're given some information. So these are the different sources\nthat we can stream video from. So YouTube, SlideShare,\nVimeo, Stream, and Flip. So we basically need to grab\nthe address or the URL of that video and paste it in here. Once we paste it in here, we'll get\na nice preview of the video, just ensuring that we have the correct one. So I'm going to go ahead and jump\nover to our YouTube page with the video that I want to stream here. Here we go. So this is the video. We'll go ahead and play this here. Okay. So to grab the video address,\nI can just right click here. And I'll copy the video URL. Once that's on my clipboard here,\nI'll head back over to my PowerPoint. So right here, I'll go\nahead and paste the video. So I can, you can right click and paste\nthe video in there, or you can press control V and we can see it shows up here. So here's my little tutorial\non Microsoft 365 basics. We can preview the video right here. And there we go. So even though it's an hour and 26\nminutes long, we're streaming it. So as long as you have an internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. This is not being stored in our\nPowerPoint, so it's not taking up space as is the video that\nwe uploaded from our computer. I'll go ahead and click on insert. And here is my video. So I can either have it take up\nthe entire slide like that, or I can go ahead and resize it. If I click on the video format,\nI can still do things, like I can correct it, I can recolor it if I want to. I can even go ahead and\nplace it in a frame. So maybe I want to place\nit in a frame like this. I can do that, or a simple frame. Um, Now, if I click on the playback\ntab here, I noticed that these options over here, they're grayed out. So, none of the editing controls. The only thing I can do really is to decide whether I want this to play\nin sequence, meaning I have to click on it, or if I want it to\nplay automatically here as well. I'll go ahead and choose automatically. So we don't have all the tools because\nwe don't really, you know, this is, this video is being streamed. We don't own the video, so we\ncannot edit it here as well. I'll go ahead and click\non my reading view here. Let's see what this looks like. There we go. So we can kind of fast forward. So depending on your internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. All right, I'll go ahead\nand press escape here. I'll press escape again\nto go back to my slide. So that is how we insert an online video\nfrom those different sources as well. Again, we can play it. It works well right from the stream. We just don't have all of the resources. normal bells and whistles that we\nhave if we actually own the video. I'm going to go ahead and delete this. I'll just press the delete\nkey to get rid of it. Now let's just take a look\nat the stock of online video. I'll click on the insert tab. I'll go back over to video and let's take\na look at some of the stock videos here. So these are not really long videos. They're pretty short, maybe in the\nrange of 9 to 15 seconds and Let's see, I'll go ahead and grab this one here. I'll go ahead and insert this. So it took up the entire slide, but\nagain, you can always resize it. We can, just like with our other\nobjects, we can resize them. I'm okay with it taking up\nthe entire slide though. That's perfectly fine. So I can go ahead and play it here. And this is going to be about\nnine seconds, just a little over nine seconds here as well. So if I were to preview this,\nI'll go on reading mode. So there you go. Pretty cool. I'll press the escape key and let's\nsee what options we have available. So this is from the stock, so we can still\ndo the same things with the video format. We can place it in a frame if we want to. Maybe I'll put it in a frame like that. We have the corrections\nthat we can use as well. And as far as playback, because\nthis is from the stock, we do have the capability to trim the video. So we can actually trim\nthe video if we want to. We can specify when it\nstarts, when it ends. We can also opt to play it full screen. So all of the other options\nthat we have there are pretty much good to go here as well. Now, one of the things is the, we have\nwhat's called a poster frame and this allows us to basically put a poster on\nthe first, first glance at the video here. So if I wanted to maybe show this part, I\ncan go ahead and click on poster frame and I'll say this will be the poster frame. Starting frame for my actual video here. You can also go ahead and insert an image. So if you wanted to insert an image\nfrom file, that's basically what you'll see before you actually play the video. So if I click play here, there we go. So that's what it's all\nabout inserting videos. into your PowerPoint presentation,\neither the stock library, online sources, or a video locally from your device. The screen recording is a\nreally nice tool in PowerPoint. Many of us are not aware that we\ncan actually record our screen. No need to buy an expensive program. We have one built in right here. After we record our screen, it\nwill insert the recording right onto our slide for us here as well. So if I click on screen recording, it's\ngoing to minimize my PowerPoint window. Whatever is in the background will\nbe brought to the front here as well. I'll click on screen recording. Let's take a look at the what's available. So as you can see, when we're recording\nthe screen, we can select the area. of our screen that we want to record. Mine is already pre selected. If you want to record your audio,\nyour voice via your microphone, you can go ahead and turn on the audio. And if you want to record\nyour mouse pointer, you can go ahead and record that as well. I'll record my audio. I'll record my pointer here as well. And I'll go ahead and select my area. But first, what I want to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and just kind of resize my, my window here for Microsoft Edge. And I'm going to bring it down. One of the things that happens\nwith a screen recorder, this little toolbar here gets in the way\nsometimes when you're recording. So I want to make sure that my. Recording area is below that box. So I'll go ahead and reselect my area. I'll just draw a box around\nmy Microsoft Edge window here. Like that. And there we go. So, what you can do, if you want to\nrecord your entire screen, when you want to stop or pause your recording,\nyou can use the shortcut key. So, Windows logo, shift plus Q, that\nwill stop the recording for you, this way you don't have to go back to\nthe top of your screen, expose this little toolbar here, and click on stop\nrecording, because that will show up on your recording, at least the last\ntime I did it, that's what happened. I'll go ahead and click on record, I'll\nget a countdown, I'll get a quick reminder of shortcut is to stop the recording. Let's go ahead and do that. So in this case, I'll just demonstrate\nhow to sign up for a course at learnit. com. Let's get started on how to\nsign up for a course at learnit. com. Let's first go to www. learnit. com. Once we're here, we can either\ngo ahead and sign in or register. Or if you want to go ahead and view\nall classes, we can click here. Once we're here, we can search for a\nclass of interest, or we can scroll down to see our upcoming courses here as well. Here's an Excel introduction course. I'll go ahead and click on here. So it gives me the details, what will be\ncovered, and it also shows the upcoming schedule for these classes as well. Maybe I'll go ahead and take a little\nbreak, and then in February, I want to go ahead and take this course. So I'll click on my little plus\nicon here to add this to the cart. And I'll remove the other one. I'll go to checkout. And from here, I simply just need to\ngo ahead and click on the next step and continue the login, registration,\npayment, and confirmation process. And I am good to go. And that's all to it. So there we go. I was able to do a, just\na small recording there. About a minute and 15 seconds. You can see it inserts the recording\nfor us right here onto the slide. Again, we can resize this if we want to. Doesn't necessarily have to\ntake up the entire screen. Maybe what I'll do is I'll\njust go ahead and center it. Kind of align things a little\nbetter here on the slide. There we go. And so we can go ahead and play it. And as we can see, of course, my\nvoice records, my, my cursor as well. So really, really nice tool. Now because we inserted this screen\nrecording, we have all of the tools of the editing tools, right? So if we wanted to trim the, the\nvideo, we can kind of preview it, make sure everything looks good. If it doesn't, we can always go\nahead and just trim different parts of the video here as well. We have all of the other tools that we can\ngo ahead and use, as we mentioned before. If you have offline captions, you\ncan go ahead and insert captions for the, um, for the video as well. So it's a really nice tool,\nreally nice tool to use as a learning or as a help aid. So a really nice option here as well. Go ahead and take advantage\nof the screen recording tool. Go ahead and upload one or two. The good thing is once we're done,\nwe can go ahead and save this. So if you make any changes to it on\nthe playback tab, we can click on save media as you can do the same\nthing by right clicking on the video and clicking on save media as we can\nsave it as media file or we can even save it as a picture here as well. So we can save it as a picture. We can save the media as a media file. So pretty cool. Go ahead and play around with the screen\nrecording tool and come right back. Welcome back. And let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number six. So we'll talk about collaborating\non a PowerPoint presentation here. So there's a couple of\nthings that we need to do. We first need to go ahead and save. Our presentation to OneDrive. And after we do that, we can go ahead\nand share the presentation and one, once we have uploaded it to either\nOneDrive or SharePoint, we can share it and we can go ahead and view different\nversions of the file here as well. So you can either click on the\nfile tab and click on save As. Go ahead and save it to one\nof your OneDrive spaces. Or if you have the share\nicon here, click on share. It's going to first ask you to\ngo ahead and upload it to your OneDrive and then you can share it. I'll go ahead and save it and then\nI'll come back once I have that saved. Now that I have it saved, what I can\ndo is click on the share icon here. So I'll go ahead and click on share. And we get to this dialog box. Now, this dialog box has had some changes\nrecently, looks a little different, but this is the modern version of it here. So what I can do is I first need\nto decide, well who do I want to share this document with, how do\nI want to share it, and what type of access do I want them to have. So, I can either copy a link, or\nAnd send that link out via email or by Teams chat or any other medium. And anyone that has that link,\nthey can either edit or they can view the particular file here. Well, this is collaboration. I want to go ahead and send it to\nAdele, who's on my sandbox account. So I'll go ahead and type in Adele here. I'll make sure that Adele can edit to make\nchanges and I'll just say, please edit. And that's pretty much it. Once I go ahead and press\nsend, I'm good to go. If I want more advanced options, I\ncan go ahead and click on the sharing settings here and I'll have some other\noptions, but I have everything I need just on this very first window here. I'm sending this via Outlook\nto Adele, edit access. And I'm going to go\nahead and send it here. All right. So I'll go ahead and close this out. Let's head on over to Adele's mailbox. See if we get that message here. I'll go ahead and refresh. Here it is. So it just came in. This is what the message looks like. A file has been shared with you. Here's the custom message. I'll go ahead and click on open here. And this will open up. online. Now my recipient will have the option\nif they want to open in the desktop app, they can do that as well. But to keep it simple, we'll just open\nthe file here in the web and here we go. So here's the, here's Adele's\nversion of the file and Adele can see that I'm working in here. My avatar appears here\nbecause I'm currently in the file and I'm working on it. If I scroll down, we can see exactly, I'm\ncurrently on this slide for lesson six. Well, that's where we need to go. So I'll go ahead in here\nand I'll add a task. I'll say task two. And the owner here will be Adele. And I'll say that this,\num, has, Not yet started and progress is zero percent. So let's see what that looks like. I'll go back to my desktop copy here. Now we can see the changes\nhave already been made. I can see that Adele is showing up\nas a guest contributor and I can see Adele is right here on slide end. Number five, right? So I'll go ahead and put myself in here. Now we can keep on editing here as well. Alright, so task three\nis going to be Nester. Now what I can do, if I click\non the review tab, I can add comments in here, right? So maybe I want to add a comment regarding\nthe video Task number three, I'll go ahead and put a comment in here and\nI'll say please confirm with Nestor. So this is the whole concept\nbehind collaborating. You can comment in here, we can work on\nthe file together, and we're good to go. Let's go back to the, let's see\nhere, let's click on the review tab. And let's click on show comments. Right. So here, here are the comments\nhere as well that we can see. So that's pretty cool. So we can go ahead and make some changes. I'll go ahead and reply to this and\nI'll say, I will take care of that. Go ahead and post the reply here as well. And so there we go. So it's a matter of saving to\nOneDrive and or SharePoint. sharing the document with edit access\nand being able to mark up the document at the same time here as well. I could even see the\nnotes that are in here. Let's go ahead and take a look at the\ndifferent versions of the document. I'll go back to here. I'll click on the file tab\nand I'll click on info. And now what I can see\nis the version history. It's on the info tab. Here's the version\nhistory of the document. Let's see what versions\nhave been captured so far. I'll click here. And so far, since I uploaded\nit and saved it, I can see that three versions have been saved. Here's the version as of 11. 05, 11. 09, and 11. 11 as well. So what I can do is I can go ahead\nand open a older version here. Let's see what this one looks like. So right now we have three tasks. So this kind of opens up the, that version. So we can see the current\nversion has three tasks. This version only has two tasks in here. So this is pretty helpful because\nsometimes some changes are made that are just too drastic and you want to be\nable to fall back to a prior version. And so the fact that the versions\nare being saved automatically, It's a really, really big help here as well. If I wanted to restore this\nversion, I can click on restore. This would make this the\ncurrent version here as well. But I don't want to do that. I just want to go back to the\nto the other version here. So I'll go ahead and close this out. And it brings me back\nto my updated version. I'll go ahead and close this pane here. And I am good to go. Now what I can do is, let's see, if I go\nover to the file tab, click back on info and I click on protect here. So what I can do is I can mark\nthis as final, but everyone will need to be logged out first. So I can let all of my collaborators\nknow that there's no more changes being made to this document. We're marking it as final here as well. Right now, while we're here, it's\ngood to take a look at these things. We can see the, on the info tab here,\nwe have the media size and performance. We can see that we have 68 megs here. The entire presentation is currently\n71 megs, mostly because of the screen recording and that video\nthat we uploaded earlier as well. I'll go back here. And so that's how you\ncollaborate on a document. For lesson seven, we'll talk about\ncustomizing slideshow behavior. So what we'll discuss is some of the\nthings that we can do before we run our slideshow, and some things that we\ncan do during our slideshow as well. So sometimes you may notice when you're\nrunning your slideshow, your presenter window is either turned off or turned on,\nor it's showing up on the wrong monitor. Well, those are things that we\ncan use to set up a slideshow. To set up a slideshow, let's click on\nthe slideshow tab here and we have an entire section here devoted to setup. Now we can go ahead and click on\nsetup slideshow and it's going to be a combination of all of these\ndifferent things here using time in timings, using the presenter\nview, things like that here as well. So, let's click on setup slideshow and\nwe're presented with this dialog box here. And there's a couple of different areas. So how do we want to run the presentation? By default, when you run\ntheir presentation, it takes up the entire screen. But if you wanted to kind of have\nit run in reading mode, you can choose the second option, right? It just runs in a window. That way, it doesn't take\nup your entire screen. You can resize it. And then if you wanted to just\nkind of loop on maybe a big TV. You can go ahead and use\nthe browse at a kiosk. So it's full screen. You'll notice if you, when you check\nthat option, it's automatically going to loop until you stop the slideshow. So you may walk into a building\nat a corporation, you may see the same slideshow running\nover and over and over again. It's in kiosk mode. Right, I'll go back to presented\nby a speaker full screen. And then over here for show\nslides, you can determine which slides you want to show. You can leave it just for all, or\nwe can say, I only want to show slides one to five, or we can do\nthat or show everything here as well. We don't have any custom shows in here. We'll talk about that\nin just a little bit. If we create some custom shows, we can\nchoose to run the custom show as well. So these things just kind of gives\nyou some, some confidence as you're running your slideshow, because maybe\nyou don't want certain slides to show up on this particular presentation. Now, in terms of advancing slides right\nnow, by default, it's going to use timings, if any timings are present. So we can either adjust the timing for\neach slide, but we're going to go ahead and record the entire presentation. So there's really no need\nto rehearse the timings. Down here, if you're using multiple\nmonitors, you want to make a choice. Do you want to use presenter view? Presenter view is a really nice thing\nto use because while your audience is seeing your presentation, you are\ntaking a look at your presenter view. So you can see what's coming next,\neither a slide or an animation. You also have notes that you can\nuse as talking points as well. So I'm going to go ahead\nand use presenter view. And my slideshow is going to\nrun on my primary monitor. I'll leave that as is for now. I'll go ahead and press OK. And I'll go ahead and\nrun my slideshow here. So here we can see my\nslideshow is running. I'll go ahead and switch the presenter\nview so that it's showing on this monitor. And let's take a look\nat the presenter view. I'll press escape. I'll go back into setup slideshow. And I want my slideshow to\nrun on my internal display. I'll press OK. And now I'll run my presentation. So on my other screen, I have the\nslideshow, but here's the presenter view. And as you can see, it's\npretty nice because we have any notes that we have in here. We can see what's coming up next. So this is our next slide,\nlesson number eight. And right here, I can just kind\nof navigate through my slides. If I have any animations, I can\nsee what's coming up next as well. And so pretty nice. What I can also do if I want to\njump to a slide, I can open up my see all slides pane right here. Now my audience will not see\nthis, only I can see this. They're still seeing the current slide. So if I wanted to navigate to\nthis slide, if I click on it, now that is being displayed on\nmy audience screen here as well. Other things I can do, I can go\nahead and turn on the pen and laser and pointer tools, right? So I can go ahead and just\nkind of use those here as well. We'll talk about these\nin just a little bit. And if I wanted to go ahead\nand toggle my camera, I can go ahead and turn on my camera. I can turn on the subtitles right here. So a lot of things we can do\nright from the presenter window. So if I toggle the subtitles,\nnow it's going to be writing. Whatever I'm saying here. I'll go ahead and turn that off. Then we have some other\ntools here as well. If you wanted to hide the presenter\nview, you can go ahead and do that. But we're good to go. I'll go ahead and end\nthe slideshow from here. And those are just some of the basics\nwhen it comes to setting up a slideshow. I'll go back down to lesson number 7 here. And let's go ahead and\ncreate a custom slideshow. So over here on the slideshow tab,\num, we have the custom show in the start slideshow command group, right? If I click on this dropdown here,\nI don't have any custom shows. I'll go ahead and click here. So I want to create a new custom show. Well, why would you want\nto create a custom show? Maybe you just have one really\nlong, you know, slide deck. You may have 30 slides. but maybe you divide that slide, that\nslide deck into three different sections. So instead of showing all 30 slides, you\nmaybe just want to show the first 10. So what I can do is click on new,\nand I'll just call this lesson five. So I want my title slide. Here's lesson five. So here are the three slides\nthat make up lesson five. I'll go ahead and add those. And now I can reorder them if I\nwant to, move them up and down, but I'll go ahead and press OK. Now I can see I have Lesson 5 in here. If I go ahead and click on Show,\nit's only going to show those slides. So here's my presenter view, and\nas you can see, it's only showing those four slides that make up that\nparticular show, and we're good to go. So that is a custom show. Now, keep in mind, when we're setting\nup the slideshow, we can also say, well, let's just go ahead and run that\nLesson 5 custom slideshow here as well. So pretty good. Okay, let's go ahead and stop here. I want you to be able to practice. Go ahead and just set up your slideshow. Go ahead and practice. Make sure that your presenter\nview is turned on, it's showing on the, on the screen of your choice. And go ahead and take a look at\nsome of the different tools here. We'll come back and we'll go\nahead and take a look at some of the annotating tools that are\navailable while we are presenting. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and set up\nnavigation for our slideshow. Now remember when you were presenting. If you right click, you can pretty much go\nto a slide of your choice if you want to. Once we have the presenter view\nturned on, we can kind of jump around, but it would be nice to kind\nof give our audience really nice feature called the zoom feature. Okay. So what the zoom feature is, and I'm\nactually going to insert a slide here. So right after my title slide,\nand this will be, I'll just call this my landing slide. And what I'm going to do, I'll\njust quickly insert some links to my different lessons here. So to do that, I'll go ahead and\npress control K on my keyboard. So this will insert a hyperlink, right? So just like in the other office\ndocuments, Excel, And Word, we can link to a place in the document. So instead of linking to an\nexisting file or webpage, I'll click on place in this document. And now what I can do is I\ncan link to different slides. So I want to be able to\nlink first to lesson five. And for the text, it says\nlesson five working with media. That's perfectly fine. I'll go ahead and leave that as is. And just like that, we have a hyperlink. I'll go ahead and press enter. I'll repeat the process for 6, 7, and 8. So I'll press Ctrl K. To a place in the document,\nI want to go to Lesson 6. I'll accept the text. I'll press OK. I'll do that two more times. Ctrl K. This time, Lesson 7. And I'll go ahead and press OK. One more time. Control K, and this will be for Lesson 8. Right. So I have a nice little\nlanding slide here. So basically, if I go into, if I\nrun this in reading mode, what I can do is I can click on this link\nwhile I'm presenting, and this will take me to that particular slide. Now it would be nice if we can go\nback to that landing slide, have a little button that we can click\non, so we can always go back. Right. I want to be able to get back to this\nslide by just clicking on a button. So we have what's called a zoom feature. Now check this out. Look what I'm going to do here. I'll go to lesson five, and from\nlesson five I want to be able to go back to the landing slide. I'm going to drag my landing slide. Just going to click and drag it. I can drag it right onto my slide here. Maybe I'll put it right, right here. Okay. And then I'll move this\nother icon out of the way. I'll put this down here somewhere. All right. So you're saying, well,\nwhat just happened? What did you just do? I'm just going to position\nthis up here at the top. So this is called a zoom feature. So now I have a link to a\nslide and another slide. Let's go into reading mode\nand let's see how this works. Here we go. So I'm here on this particular slide. And now if I want to go back to\nmy landing slide, if I click here, so it zooms in to that slide for me. And now what I can do is I can go ahead\nand jump to another lesson here as well. If I press the back key, it\ngoes back to lesson five. Or I can just go ahead\nand click back here. And jump back to lesson five as well. So that is the zoom feature as well. Now what I can do if I wanted to,\nI can go ahead and change this. So right now it's just\na picture of my slide. If I click on here, I'll notice that\na zoom tab appears here as well. So maybe what I'll do is I'll go ahead\nand change this image to something else. And maybe I'll grab an icon. And maybe I'll look for a home icon. Maybe I'll use this one. So I've converted this to a home icon. Now I can resize it. I can even put it at a\nstyle to it if I want to. I'll keep it simple. I'll just put it here on\nthe top right of my slide. There you go. So that's my zoom feature. Now what I can do, I\ncan actually copy this. And I can paste it on lesson six. I just need to move this out of the way. So I'll go ahead and paste\nthis here on Lesson 6. And I just copied and pasted it. Well, let's see if this still works. I'll go ahead and run this\nslide in reading mode. If I click on it, it brings\nme to my landing slide. I'll go back to Lesson\n6, and I'm good to go. So that's the zoom feature. All right, so go ahead and create\nyour first zoom, go ahead and change it to an icon of your choice. Again, to do that, just click on the\nzoom, click on the zoom tab, and you can change the image here as well. Go ahead and add that home button\nto each of your lesson slides, and now we'll be able to navigate back\nand forth as we are presenting. Now that we've added some navigation and\nwe've set up some of the basics, it's time to go ahead and present and take a look\nat some of the tools that are available. We already discussed the presenter view\nso now what we can do, let's take a look at how we can annotate a presentation and\nwe can enable these subtitles as well. Now we can accomplish these as\nwell through the presenter view. I'm going to go back to my slideshow. Let's just make sure that I'll\nturn off my presented view. And I want my slideshow\nto run on this screen. So everything is good to go. I want to make sure all\nof my slides are selected. And from here, if I want to, I can go\nahead and choose my laser pointer color. I will be using the laser pointer. I'll be using the pen as well. So I can actually select\nmy color ahead of time. I'll leave them both on red. I'll go ahead and press okay. You can press F5 to start your slideshow. So here's my slideshow. I'll go ahead and head on over to\nmy next slide here just by clicking. And so here's my landing slide. I'll just go to lesson 5 here. And here's lesson 5. Now on the bottom we have\nsome kind of grayed out tools. So we can go to the last slide,\nwe can go to the next slide. Here are the pen tools down here. So if I click here. I can either choose my laser pointer, so I can go ahead and just\nkind of point on my screen. If I go back down here, I\ncan change that to the pen. And the pen basically allows us\nto just kind of mark things up. So I can do things like that. Terrible arrow. Right, so we can do that. If I want to go back, I\nwill just uncheck the pen. Now I have my pointer back here, and\nnow I can go ahead and either play my video or go to the next slide. I'll go to my next slide here as well. And what else do I have here? Here's the highlighter. So if I want to highlight\nsomething, turn on my highlighter, go ahead and highlight it here. And of course we can change the color. So. We can change the color for all\nof the ink down here as well. So for my highlighter, if I wanted\ninstead of yellow, maybe I want orange. Here's my orange highlighter\nhere as well that I can use. Now, let's go ahead and I'll\nget my pointer back here. So I'll unselect my highlighter. If I move over to the right,\nhere's the slide sorter. And here are the subtitles, so I\ncan go ahead and Turn those on. And this is what my screen now looks like. This is very helpful. And we're good to go. Turn on my video if I want to. And then here are some other tools. So if I wanted to transition\nto a custom show, I can. Even though I'm not running presenter\nview right now, I can still go ahead and turn that on here as well. And for the subtitle settings. I can either show them on the top where\nit's overlaid on my presentation or I can change the location of it as well. Maybe I'll put it be above\nthe slide, the top like that. So we have different options\nthat we can use here. Now, if you didn't mark up your slide,\nwe do have an eraser here as well. So you can erase them individually\nor you can choose to go ahead and erase all of the ink on a slide. All right, now keep in mind when\nyou are marking up your slide here, all of the ink will remain\nunless you remove it. So if I were to close my presentation\nhere and go back to this slide, this arrow and this somewhat of a circle\nshow up as shapes here as well. So we want to make sure it will ask you\nanyway, before you close the presentation, do you want to remove all the ink as well? But while we're here, let's\ntest out our navigation. I'll get my pointer back here\nand I'll jump to the, let's jump to lesson number eight. And from lesson number eight, we\ncan go back to that landing slide and jump to lesson number five. So pretty cool. So we're zooming in and\nout of our landing slide. If you press the back key, After\nyou go to your landing slide, it goes back to the slide that\nyou were on before here as well. All right, I'll go ahead and end the show. I'll just go ahead and\npress the escape key. And it asks me right here, do\nI want to keep my annotations? I do not, because again, they will\nappear as shapes on your slide. I'll go ahead and discard\nthem, and I am good to go. All right, so a lot of things that\nwe just accomplished, annotating, turning on the subtitles. We can use the presenter\nview for that as well. And we'll see those\noptions are also available. So go ahead and run your slideshow. When we come back, we'll\nput it all together. We'll take a look at how we\ncan record our slideshow so that it can run automatically. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number eight. What we want to do here is we want to\ngo ahead and automate our slideshow. So we don't want to sit and click\nthrough our slides as we're presenting. What we'd like to do is to kind\nslideshow and then we can go ahead and play it back and run it so that all the\nslides will transition automatically. So let's take a look and\nsee how we can do that here. If I click on the slideshow tab, I have the record option here, so\nI can record from the beginning. And notice what it says. So records narrations,\nanimations, transitions, ink, and laser pointer gestures. So everything that I'm doing\nwill be recorded here as well. So we don't necessarily need to\nrehearse timings because now we have the recording feature that\nwill record everything for us. So what I'm going to do, I want my\nrecorder window to show up on here. So I'll just change this here. And then I'll go ahead and press OK,\njust so we can see what that looks like. I'll go back to the first slide, and\nI'll click on record from the beginning. And this is going to open up\nmy, my recording view here. Now, before we do that, I highly\nrecommend that you use this feature called Rehearse with Coach. This is a really, really nice tool. Basically you can practice with\nthe AI coach and it's very, very intuitive and very, very robust. It's going to provide you feedback to let\nyou know if you're talking too fast, if your pace is too slow, if your voice is\nmonotone, if you're speaking too loud, too soft, if you're using filler words. So it gives you a really, really nice\nreport, kind of coaches you along the way. It'll say, great job, keep it up. So I highly recommend you\nuse the rehearse with coach. It will allow you to go through\nyour entire slide and you can practice with it there as well. Once you've done that, we'll\ngo ahead and click on record. Alright, we can also record our\nslideshow from the record tab. So here's the record from the beginning. Now, there's a lot of things\nthat we can do in here. We'll just touch on a few of them. So here we can see, here is\nthe window for our recording. Once we're ready, we just need to go\nahead and click on the record button. Just a few things to note. If you wanted to turn\non your camera, you can. Your camera will appear, um,\ndown here on the bottom right. So your image will appear down\nhere on the bottom right as well. At the very top, when you have\nnotes, we have a little teleprompter here that will help you as you're\ngoing through your actual slides. Now this is one view. Down here on the bottom right,\nthere are different views. So right now, this is\nthe teleprompter view. Let's click on this dropdown. The other one is the presenter view. So the presenter view, this is\nthe one that we're accustomed to. We can kind of see what's coming next,\neither an animation or a next slide. And we can see what our\naudience is seeing here as well. Right. Then we have other things down here. Laser pointer. Highlighter. They're all here for us as well. The other view is the slide view. So this is just your operating\njust with the slides and you can go through it there as well. I'm going to go back to\nteleprompter view and here we go. So if you want to record your\nmicrophone, you can either turn it off or you can turn it on. Um, as well, if we click\nhere for more options. You can select the microphone\nthat you want to use. You can select your camera, and if\nyou're using Cameo, which is a newer feature, you can use Cameo as well. I'm just going to do a simple recording,\njust so that we can see what the finished product will look like here. So, I'm not going to spend\ntoo much time on each slide. Here we go. Welcome to PowerPoint Module 4. My name is Mo Jones. Let's go ahead and learn together. Here's our landing slide. We have four lessons. Lesson number five, lesson\nnumber six, lesson number seven, and then finally lesson number\neight, automating a slideshow. Lesson five is all about\nworking with media. We can either insert local video\nor we can insert online video. Here's my video. I can go ahead and play this here. Once I'm done, I can go ahead and\nmove on to my next slide here. I'll go ahead and turn on my, where\nis my pen, so I can go ahead and just draw some shapes in here if I want to. I'll go to my next slide. Here's my notes at the top,\nso I can refer to that as I'm going through my slides here. So when we're inserting\nthe screen recorder. It's a matter of getting to\nthis particular icon here or this command group, the media\ncommand group on the insert tab. Remember after you insert your\nscreen recording to take a look at the playback options and the\nother formatting options as well. Lesson six is all about collaborating. As we can see, we can go ahead and\nshare a file, grant editing access. And we can go ahead and\nmark up the file together. We can see who's in the file, where\nthey're currently working on, and we can add comments to the file as well. Lesson number seven is all about some of\nthe other default settings that we can establish for our presentation as well. Don't forget about the zoom feature. We can always click on that button to\ngo back to the slide of our choice. And then finally, for lesson number\neight, I highly recommend that you record your presentation and use the\nrehearse with coach tool here as well. Now when we finish this slide\nshow, it tells us to click here to export our video. So I'll go ahead and click there\nand I can go ahead and export it to, to the location of my choice here. I'll go ahead and click on browse. Typically, you want to upload\nit to your OneDrive space. I'll just put it on my desktop here. I'll just call this copy. And I'll go ahead and\nexport that as a MP4 video. And that's going to take a\nlittle bit of time to record. Once it's finished, I'll come right back. So finally, I get the message that\nmy video was exported successfully. So from here, I can click here to view\nthe video and share with others as well. I'll go ahead and click here. And it's asking me, I do trust it. I'll go ahead and press yes. And just giving me some\nsecurity messages here. I'll just go ahead and\npress okay to open the file. Opens up in my default media\nplayer, and here we go. So there we go. So we can see everything\nhas been recorded as well. And we're good to go. I'll go ahead and close this out. And we're good to go. So that is how we record a slideshow. So notice now, for each slide,\nwe'll see the actual voice note that was left on each slide. So every slide has a\nlittle recording here. So in the past, we would have to do\nthese things kind of manually, insert the audio, insert the timings as well. But now the recording takes care\nof everything for us as well. So go ahead and record your, your\nshow, go ahead and export it. And then go ahead and play it,\nmake sure everything is okay. If you want to go ahead and share it. Feel free to do so as well. Now that we have recorded our\nslideshow, we see that everything was recorded well, we did have the option\nof exporting it to a media file, but something else happened as well. So if I were to go ahead and\njust run my slideshow, it's going to run automatically. So the timings for each slide, the voice\nnarration on each slide, and any ink. or markup that I used\nwill be played as well. So if I did not want to play the video, I\njust want to go ahead and run this slide. I'll go ahead and run it here. And we can see the voice\nnarration is included. We can see the slides are moving\nautomatically without my interaction. Okay, now I can still\njump in if I want to. But for the most part, everything is\nhappening automatically here as well. So I'll press escape. And we're good to go. So you can either share that video or play\nthe video, or you can, you can just come in and actually just run your slideshow. And here's a little bit of ink\nthat I left when I was kind of annotating my coffee cup here. So I'll just click on here, and\nI'll just go ahead and delete that from my slide as well. If you go back to the record tab,\nnow you'll notice that some of these other options are available\nbecause we did perform a recording. We can do some other things\nlike clear the recording on the current slide, or we can clear the\nrecording from all of the slides. Maybe we just want to go\nahead and redo it, right? We can save it as a show, right? So we can create a separate\nslide with the PPSX. extension there as well. We can export it to\nvideo from here as well. We can learn more to see what's new,\nwhat else we can do here as well. We can also use the cameo feature\nas well with our camera feed. So that's the benefit of recording a show. We can automate it and we still\nhave the capability to kind of interact with the slides, even\nthough it's automated here as well. Just to recap, we're able to\ncustomize the PowerPoint environment. We saw how we can create our own\nribbon tab and add our own command groups and our own commands as well. Even add more commands to\nour Quick Access Toolbar. We took a look at the Slide Master. We're able to customize design templates. We're able to save a design as a\ntemplate, and then we're able to create some infographics with SmartArt. We're able to work with media. We're able to collaborate on a\npresentation after saving the presentation to a cloud space. We're able to customize a slideshow\nbehavior, establishing some of the default settings for our slideshow, and then we're\nable to automate a slideshow as well. Remember to use the Rehearse\nwith Coach tool, and then go ahead and record your slideshow. Congrats on completing the course,\nand look forward to seeing you in a future LearnIt course. Hello everyone and welcome to\nCoPilot for Microsoft PowerPoint. My name is Joe. I'm going to be facilitating\nthis course for you today. Today we are talking about Microsoft\nPowerPoint with CoPilot capabilities. CoPilot is amazing with PowerPoint and it\nallows us to start to create presentations within seconds of just telling it what\nwe want to see in our presentation. Now, before we get into\nMicrosoft PowerPoint, we have to understand what is CoPilot. CoPilot is a powerful admin tool\nfor Microsoft Excel that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. improve efficiency, and also save time. Now it utilizes machine learning\nand AI technology to analyze your workflow and then suggest code\nsnippets based on your specific needs. And with Copilot, you can automate data\nmanipulation, formatting, calculations, and so much more without actually\nneeding extensive programming knowledge. Now a couple things with Copilot is\nthe way that it comes out with outputs. An input is when you ask it a question,\nand then the output will be the result or the answer to that question. And the way that it randomizes this\nis known as stochastic process. Now stochastic process in AI models\ncan lead to slightly different results each time the model is run. So even though we put in the same input,\nright, I can say, Hey, how much does this? equal out to my total sales. It might not be word for\nword the same exact output. And this is often what is desired, right? We often want randomness so that\nnone of us have the same answers. So just know that if you're following\nalong with this video, that you will never get the same answer as me, unless\nit's something really straightforward. Like give me the total\nsales that I've made. It will give you the total sales. That's not random, but if you ask\nthem to give you insights, it might give you something totally different\nthan the insights that gives me another thing is a couple of the\npros and cons of using co pilot. So we're going to start off with the pros. Productivity boost, right? It aims to enhance productivity by\nautomating various tasks, such as writing emails or creating presentations, or even\ntaking meeting notes, which is great. We can also integrate it with Microsoft\nSuite, which is what we're doing today. We are going to be looking at\nExcel's version of Copilot. We also have to understand\nthat it is a natural language process, which means we're able\nto just put in inputs naturally. And then we get results. And the best part about Copilot\nis learning and adaptation. It's always designed to learn\nfrom our user interactions. So the more questions we ask over\ntime, it starts to understand how we think about our data. Now, some of the cons of using\nCopilot are first off potential bias and inaccuracies, right? Of course, this is a new technology,\nso sometimes it might be generate an accurate information based\non the data it was trained on. And you'll notice that throughout\nthe course that sometimes I might not get the exact answer I want\nand I need to teach it what I want. You'll also see here that there's\nan adoption and learning curve. As with any new technology, you're\ngoing to have to get used to using the interface or even certain input commands\nthat you're going to ask it or certain prompts that you want to look at. So that's why this video is going\nto be super helpful for you, because it's going to allow for you to\nunderstand those learning curves. And last but not least,\nethical concerns, of course. You know, it's an AI assistant,\nso we want to make sure that we're not just using it to generate\nmisinformation or plagiarized content. Now, last quick note before we actually\ndive into this, is that Microsoft Copilot is still in development, and\nits final capabilities, the pricing, availability, is yet to be determined. So as with anything else that is AI\npowered, it's crucial to approach it with a critical mindset, right? We want to be sure that we're\nmaintaining our privacy and security. We're going to comply with any\nof our company's rules, right? And this AI is definitely\nnot a replacement for human expertise or decision making. So we are actually using it\nas a tool and replacement. I've opened up PowerPoint and\njust created a blank presentation. Now we're going to use co pilot to\nactually create a presentation for us. So in order to do this, we're\ngoing to go through the home tab. And inside of the Home tab, we're\ngoing to go all the way at the end, and you'll see Copilot. Now, funny enough, you'll\nsee Copilot next to Designer. We're going to talk about\nthis in a later section, but they go hand in hand together. But for now, let's just open up Copilot\nPane, and you'll see once you click on Copilot, it opens up the pane. Now, right away when you open up\nCopilot Pane, you can see here that there's some things you can try. So they give you a couple of prompts\nright away, like create a presentation. Or create a presentation from\na file that already exists, or add a slide about something. So you can use these three\nprompts right away, or you can ask questions about the presentation. Or if you want to view more of the\nprompts, you'll see at the bottom, there's this little book icon. This is actually where we can\nview prompts for PowerPoint. So if you click on it, You'll see\nwe can either create, and if you click the little parent icon, it\nshows you create a presentation from a file, create a presentation about\nsomething, add a slide about something. You can go to edit, or you\ncan add an image of something. That's a pretty cool one. We can go to ask where we can give\nspecific examples for something. And if you want to view more prompts,\njust click on view more prompts and it'll open up prompts from the co pilot lab. We'll talk about co pilot lab in\na little bit, but this is where we can see other prompts as well. I'll just click the X. So let's try it out. Let's actually create a\npresentation from scratch. So you can either just click\ncreate a presentation, or you could just type it out here. I like to just click it because it\nautomatically fills it in for you. And let's create a presentation. Uh, we can do it about anything,\nbut what I'm interested in is creating a presentation about\nhealth and we'll just say health. Let's see what it, what it comes up\nwith, create a presentation about health. And it's going to take a moment. It's just thinking about everything,\ngoing through all the different information and data that Copilot\nhas access to, and you can see at the bottom, it's starting to work. It's downloading media. And there we go. It says, okay, here you go. A presentation about health has\nbeen created with multiple slides. If you like, I can help you\nrewrite slides or you can use Designer to adjust the layout. Once again, Designer is going\nto come in handy in the way that you want to change the design. Now, what I love about this is that look\nhow amazing this presentation looks. First off, we get this starting\npage here, the starting slide where it says tips for a healthy life. It has a nice little background picture\nand believe it or not, we also have access to Yeah, speaker note, so we\ncan quickly talk to, um, you know, an audience and have those speaker notes. You'll also see here, you could\npress play, and it has a movement. Yeah, it's a media. How awesome is this? I just love this so much. I really do. So, that's another fun thing, and it\njust stays on a loop until you stop it. If we go to the next slide, it says\neat a balanced diet, eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables,\ninclude whole grains and lean protein in your diet, and limit your intake\nof sugar, salt, and saturated fats. So that makes sense. And then you have your speaker\nnotes at the bottom here as well. On the next page, we have stay\nhydrated, drink at least eight cups of water a day, avoid sugary\ndrinks, limit alcohol consumption. Go to the next slide. It just has an awesome amount of\ninformation, regular exercise is good for you, and manage stress. So as you can see, within seconds, it\nhas created a full presentation for us, with speaker notes, with images. But you might be wondering,\ndoes it include animation? Well, let's take a look. So we see here, the nice movement, go to our next slide. So right now there are no\nanimations here, go to the next one. That's the one thing that\nwe wouldn't need to include. So if I ask it to include\nanimations, let's see what it says. I don't think Copilot can do\nthis yet, but I want to see. Can you add animation to my bullet points? Let's see what it says here. I'm going to say that it's going to\nprobably come back with it can't do it yet, but I'm always curious because\nthey're constantly updating these apps. Pulling things together. Okay, so yeah, I can't do it. I can answer general questions\nor those about presentations, but they can't add animations. So that's just one little thing you\nhave to do, which it's simple enough. I'll just go to animations and\njust fly them in real quick. Boom. Done. Go to the next one. Just click. Flying. Done. Go to the next one. Click. Flying. Done, and we have a fully\ncreated presentation with speaker notes, and we are all set to go. Now, why I love speaker notes so\nmuch for me personally, is because I use them while I'm presenting. For instance, when I'm presenting,\nI actually don't see this view. I see my presenter view and what\nthis presenter view does for me is it allows for me to see my\nspeaker notes on the other side. So I'm going to showcase this to everyone. There it is. So now I have my speaker notes right here. I know exactly what people\nare seeing currently. And also, I can see what I'm\ngetting ready to talk about now. So I would say, Hey everyone, my\nname is Joe, we're talking about tips for a healthy lifestyle. Health is wealth, and nothing is more\nimportant than taking care of your body. Incorporating these tips into\nyour lifestyle can lead to a healthier, happier life. See what I did there? I didn't even have to think\nabout what I was going to say. The notes are already there for me. And then when I'm ready to go\nto the next slide here, now I can say, eat a balanced diet. This is one of the most important\nthings you can do for your health, and then I can go through. Eat a variety of fresh fruits and\nvegetables, whole grains, right? So, those speaker notes, I\nalways say are some of the most important things that you need. Yeah, this is amazing. We asked it to create a presentation\nand it went above and beyond. We just went over how we can\ncreate a presentation from scratch with just a sentence in Copilot. Now I'm going to show you how\nCopilot works with templates that are pre existing. So, the first thing I want\nto do is select a template. So you can go to More Themes on\nyour Startup page, and you can look for whatever makes sense to you. Let's go with I really like this design\nright here, this Minimalist Presentation. So I'm going to use that\none, and click Create. Now at this point, it all has some sort\nof theme here with different topics. And I'm actually going to use CodePilot\nonce again to create another presentation. But what I'm interested to see is,\nis it going to keep my existing theme or is it going to replace it? So can we use our template? With creating a presentation. So I'm going to see if I can do\nthat, create a presentation about lions, but keep my same name\nand let's see if it can do this. It's looking over it. It's going to be very exciting. And I love exploring\nlike this with co pilot. This is something you\ncan do to see what works. What doesn't work. It's a learning. And ever learning, let's see what it says. Okay. So it says that creating\na new presentation will replace your existing slide. So you may want to save a copy first,\nor I can say create a new draft. Let's create a new draft and see what it does with this. Like I said, it's an ever learning system. So this is what's most exciting. So it did replace it, but I mean, it\nkept some of that coloration there. Once again, we do get the\nlions, the king of the jungle. I love that. Combined behaviors. Line physical characteristics. We get a bunch of notes with it as\nwell, and we're just ready to go. The one thing that we have to do\nas always is add in animation. So while this presentation\nlooks really amazing, it is not using my original theme. So it's better off if you're gonna\nuse Copilot for presentations. I would say just simply use a blank\npresentation, because choosing a template is just not going to work anyway. For those of you that might have\ncompanies, That need to really think about branding and they might have\npre existing slides for you, let's say what I would do in that case is\nafter you get the presentation, and I would just strip away everything. So you'll see here that\nthe slides are here. We could change this to a title\nslide, or we can change this layout. Look like this, but they still\nexist your original theme, their original layout, your design. You're going to have to change each slide. So for this one, once again, I\nwant this to just be the section one or an agenda or content. So I'll call this agenda. I'll do this one as an\nagenda layout as well. And just be careful because\nyou see what's happening with the text boxes and everything. We're going to have to switch those back. So. You can still switch these\nto what it needs to be. If I want to change the layout, so let's\nsay two content, it keeps your content there and just the other way it wasn't\nshowcasing and you can still have it be as similar to your branding or to your\nlayouts that already exist as you can. And there it is. All right. So that's one way to sort\nof overcome that template. If you are forced to use some sort of\ntemplate like that, do I see this for, you know, changing in the foreseeable future? Maybe, you know, we'll, we'll see. I know Microsoft is trying to\nbe as accommodating as possible. So you will notice designer keeps\npopping up like I said before copilot and designer are working together very\nwell We're actually going to discuss that in our next section So what we're\ngoing to talk about next is how copilot and designer work so well together\nSo the first thing I'm going to do is create a presentation with copilot I want to talk about sharks. So I'm going to say create\na presentation about sharks. They're interesting, right? So create a presentation about sharks. It's going to work on it. Look over the things for us. All this stuff that it always does. And then once it comes through,\nwe'll take a look at what sort of design it does for us. So it looks like for this\none, it's not working. It says, I'm sorry, I'm not able\nto generate those slides for you. Is there something else I can do to\nhelp you build your presentation? Let's do the same prompt, because it's\nfunny to see, as I explained before, that this process is randomized. So all the outputs are always randomized. Preprint does it for the next\ntime and it looks like it might not work for a second time. Oh, actually it's working this time. And look at that. So funny enough, this is a prime\nexample of how young co pilot truly is. That's why I always say to you, if it\ndoesn't work the first time, try it again. This is just proof right here that\nsometimes it's not going to work the first time around, but it will work the second\nand look how amazing these speaker notes are too, it has so many different things. So, and I love this. Look at this. The media background. That's always so cool. Now at this point, I'm going to\nalso open up my designer because some of these signs I might not\nlike, for instance, I do like this. This looks great, but it doesn't\nlook like the rest of it. There's a lot of like pink\nand light colors, purples. But then there's just\nthis dark color here. This would make more sense for me. I actually like this one more. And then I can have it like that. So that just looks a lot nicer\nfor me than that other one. So that's why the designer just\ncomes into play right away. It looks so great. So at this point, let's take a look\nat what they actually put in here. Pictures. I like the little pluses and ohs. Sharks and their behaviors. Remember, we always have to go\nin and add the animations, shark anatomy. You know, I really don't\nlike the way this looks. So once again, I'm going to go\nover, I'm going to go to my home tab and choose designer and let's see\nwhat else they could come up with. Okay. This looks a little lighter. I do like this. The reason I don't like the way\nthat this one looks is it sort of looks less like content, and it\nlooks more like a section change. And I'm not changing, you know,\ntalking about the topic of charts. So that's why I want\nto change this design. It's important to do that, have\nsimilar designs going through. Same thing here. I want it to look a little more similar to what we have. Let's see if I can do this one too. Oh, there it is. And now we have everything\nlooking super similar. It looks very consistent. And once again, I'm just going to add in\nhere all of my animations, and then I'll tell you what the overall outcome is. It's just going to look great. Let's see what it looks like. So here we go. The wonders of sharks. Sharks in their behaviors. Three points about that\nshark anatomy there. Sharks in conservation, shark myths and facts. Sharks and popular culture come\nup with sharks in the clouds. I don't even know why the direct in\nthe clouds like that, but there we go. We have an amazing presentation\nright away, and we were able to then sort of make it more consistent. With the designer. So that's why I always say co pilot\ndesigner go together Well, and what I love about this new system is that\nyou'll see co pilot up top You can switch to designer at the bottom so\nyou can switch between two quickly The next thing I want to talk\nabout is how we can actually add slides to our presentation. So We have this presentation here,\nwe've been talking about charts, and what I want to do is you can\nclick on change topic if you like. What this does is it refreshes\nall of your past prompt. So when you're asking about things and\nyou sort of want to change gears or change topic, you can click change topic. It's going to reset all\nyour history of prompts. And then it's like, what\nwould you like to do now? Now this is going to go back\nto our original three prompts. We've created a presentation. We'll actually talk about creating\nthe presentation from a file in a moment, but we want to talk about\nhow can we add a slide about. So I'm thinking I have sharks, their\nbehaviors, anatomy, conservation, myths, facts, and popular culture, but\nI don't really have anything about the relationship between sharks and humans. I'm going to choose to add a\nslide about, or you could just. Type it. I'm going to say add a\nslide about the relationship between sharks and humans. Let's see if it can do that for us. Remember, if it doesn't work the\nfirst time, always just try again. Oh, there we go. So you'll see here, once again,\nit keeps the design, which I love. We don't have to worry\nabout design issues. It continues to stay consistent. It adds a ton of fun little\nnotes here that we can use. And then we see the relationship\nbetween sharks and humans. Sharks are not usually\naggressive towards humans. Shark attacks are rare and often\nthe result of mistaken identity. Human activity has greatly\nimpacted shark populations. So now we have a little more information. If I want, I can add even more to this. I can ask it to edit this slide. So, let's say that I do\nwant to edit this slide. I can say to please edit slide 7 to\ninclude two more facts about relationships between sharks and whales. and humans. And let's see what it does. And it's always important to\nget a little more specific. For instance, I'm saying,\nplease edit slide seven. I'm not just saying, please edit, you\nknow, to include two more facts about relationships between sharks and humans. I'm specifying that I wanted to add\nthis information to slide seven. So we'll see what it can do. So right now it says, I'm\nsorry, but I can't do that. Let's ask it to do something\na little different. Let's say, please rewrite. I did forget the S on slide, so\nwe'll see what happens, but hopefully it'll understand what I meant. Okay, so it couldn't do that either. Let's keep trying. Let's say, Please add more\ninfo or more information to this slide. Let's see if it can do that. And I'm saying this slide now to see if\nit knows that I selected on slide seven, but once again, this is just stuff and I'm\nnot sure which slides you're referring to. Could you please specify? And I'll say, um, what is the\naverage life span of a chart? What is the different types? No, we'll actually answer this. We'll say, Please add more information to slide 7. I think it was almost there. It was almost ready to go, so. And it also started giving us\nprompts to ask more questions about sharks, which I think is awesome. So let's do this. What are different types of sharks? Let's ask that question. And see what it comes up with\nand see if we can actually add this to this slide deck. Oh wow, look at all of these. That's pretty cool. So it gives us all of this and we\ncan quickly copy this information and then put it on a slide. Or we could have just said, you know,\nplease add in how many different species of sharks there are as a slide. So as you can see, editing slides\naren't as easy as it looks. You know, you can't just say,\nhey, edit my slide, because it's not understanding what I want. But we're going to just try one more\ntime to see if I can please add more information to the slide setting. Because as you can see, sometimes\nit works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you just have to\nrepeat yourself because you always get a randomized output. So you can ask the same\nquestion three times and get a different answer each time. Except when it comes to data. If you're asking, for instance, you know,\nhow many words are in this presentation, that's going to always be the same. So yeah, it looks like it's\nnot going to allow us to do it for this one, but that's okay. Let's see other prompts\nthat we can actually use. in terms of edit. Add an image of something or\norganize this presentation. So even though we can't really edit\nthe slide so well, we can edit by adding images or even organizing. What about understanding? So to summarize this presentation, we're\nactually going to talk about being able to do this a little later, create, We\ncan create a presentation or add a slide about, we just did that, so try out\ndifferent prompts for adding and editing your slides and see what you come up with. So you'll see here that I have this\nhealthy eating habits document, and I decided that I actually don't\nwant to just have this document like this, I actually want to turn\nthis into a PowerPoint presentation. We can take a file from our computers\nand transform them into PowerPoint presentations with CoPilot now. It is amazing. So let's see what it comes up with. We have healthy eating habits. We have an introduction, then we\ntalk about balanced nutrition, portion control, hydration,\nfiber rich foods, and that's it. It's just a quick one page document,\nbut let's see What happens? So the first thing I'm going\nto do is switch over and let's switch over to PowerPoint. I just opened up a blank presentation\nand I'm going to use the prompt create presentation from file. When it does that, it pulls up all these\ndifferent files that we have access to and it tells you to type or search a copy\nor paste the link of the Word document. Now we know what the Word document's\ncalled, so I'm going to type in a couple of words here, and I'm going to\ngrab my document, Word Intro Example. Once I have that document, I'll then click\nSend, and let's see what it comes up with. Now, it is looking through an entire\ndocument, and then it's going to transform it into a presentation, so it\nmight take a little bit of time here. But it shouldn't take more than two\nminutes, and you'll see that it's starting to outline the presentation\nthat it's going to generate. So it's saying, here's the outline. We're talking about healthy eating habits,\nintroduction, balanced nutrition, portion control, hydration, fiber rich foods. So everything we just read\nabout in that document. And now it's generating the slides,\nadding speaker notes as well. And look at this, I mean, this is amazing. We now have our entire Word document\ntransformed into a slideshow. Introduction, I love this. Balance and expression, all\nthe things we've talked about. Portion control, all the pictures. Adjuration. I mean, this is just within seconds. It's, it's not even taken us that long. It just looks awesome. Now, I will say this isn't\nperfect, as you can see here. These last slides are a little weird. Vegetables, I kind of\nsplit it, nuts, and fruits. I'll probably delete those\ntwo and just add these in and change this bullet point too. I don't know what that bullet point was. So even though it came over and it\nwas pretty much perfect, there are a couple of things I still need to edit. So I'll add in the nuts here and, and then we could get rid of these ones. And I think that looks great. Let's see, whole grains,\nFiber rich, fiber rich. So we're gonna have to make a change here. Let's see what we can do. I'm, just gonna take this\nand copy it or even cut it. Let's paste it here. Let's make this into a slide deck and Okay And let's make this the same. I'll use my format painter. Those all look good I want them\nto all be on the same level and this is going to look amazing And\nthen we're going to use that designer tool just like before I do want them all to,\nI mean, it won't matter once we change the designer, leave this out and let's\nsee what designer comes up with this one. I actually like this a lot, but\nit doesn't really stay consistent. I mean, a little bit. Yeah, I guess we can still use it. It's pretty much the\nsame, but I do like this. All right. And there we go. We have now just taken our Word\ndocument right here and changed it into a PowerPoint presentation. I think that's just amazing. I don't know. It has speaker notes. The only thing we really had\nto do was a couple of edits. add animations, and we're good to go. Now that I have a slide deck presentation\nwith a lot of information, what I want to do is go to change topic. I actually want to start to ask some\nquestions about our presentation. So it's going to say, what\nwould you like to talk about? I want to view some of the prompts that\nwe have where I can understand Let's say, summarize this, are there any dates? I also can go to ask to see, give me a\nspecific example from this presentation on how I can improve it for a leader. That's actually a really good one. Let's see if I could do that. Oh, I can improve it for\nmy stakeholders and see if they can give me\nspecific examples on this. And this is pretty amazing. You'll hear me say that a lot because\nCopilot really is, I mean, there's just so much you can do with it. So it says this response isn't\nbased on the presentation. It says add visuals, use images, charts. So it's just giving me some feedback on\noverall how to make a presentation better. It's not actually talking about\nthis specific presentation. But if I do want to talk about\nthis specific presentation. You can just add, ask questions\nabout it, like how many slides do I have, how many slides do I\nhave, and let's see what it does, or are there enough images\nin this presentation. According to this presentation,\nyour presentation has seven slides. Now I can even get prompted\nfor more questions about this specific presentation. For instance, what is the\ntopic of this presentation? And then it's going to work on it. Let's see what it comes up with. So this is great. Here's a summary of the deck. So I didn't ask for quite a summary,\nbut this kind of brings us into our next topic, which is being able to\nsummarize our entire presentation. But here's a couple of main ideas here. Healthy eating, balanced nutrition. You'll even see where it's linked to and\nyou can click straight onto the slide. I think it's pretty awesome. Let's say, what is the\nagenda of this presentation? According to this presentation,\nintroduction, balance, nutrition, now it starts to pull out even more information. So now I'm getting deeper\ninto our co pilot, right? And to the relevant questions\nto this presentation. So now I'm going to ask, what is\nthe importance of fortune control? Now, this might not pull\na reference directly. This is directly from my presentation\nand even references slide 1. Right or introduction slide. If I was to ask what is the\nimportance of portion control, it might actually pull this data. It's pulling it from presentation. So this is pretty awesome. Look at that. Pulling it from the portion control\nand it makes a link straight to it. So it says, according to the\npresentation, portion control is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. If I want to see where that\nis listed, I can click here. It brings me right to it. Or what are some common portion sizes? We can ask that as well. See if it can answer that from that. presentation or it has to actually\npull information from the web. Because I don't really see\nanything about portion sizes, I just see be mindful of quantity. So even though this referenced my\npresentation, it'll tell you that this response isn't based on the presentation. It had to go outside of it to find\nthe answer, which it did still. And it gives you a common portion size. How often one cup of raw leafy\nvegetables, two to three ounces. fish or lean meat, one\ntablespoon of oil or salad. Pretty cool. Now, once we're done asking questions\nlike what are some fiber rich foods or what's the importance of hydration, if\nwe want to reset all of this, always remember to click change topic and that\nwill actually reset the whole thing. And then it says, okay,\nlet's change the subject. It's not going to Actually, ask\nany of those prompts anymore, we would have to prompt it, but ask\nquestions about your presentation. Have fun with this. So we've seen how many different\nprompts there are for co pilot, and it can be a little overwhelming. But one of the great things about\nCopilot is it offers us a way to learn about the different prompts. And if you click into View\nPrompts, you can go to View More Prompts, and it's going to open\nup this Prompts from Copilot. This is where we can see all different\ntypes of prompts, and also examples, like add an image of a puppy dog to the slide,\nor create a presentation about Hawaii. Or add an agenda slide, or create\na presentation based off of a file. There's so many different ones. Get a head start, create a presentation,\ngenerate ideas, or organize your thoughts. And there's just so many different ones. But if you wanted to see all\nthe different prompts from all the different applications, you\nwould go over to the Copilot Lab. So you'll see here this link,\nsee all prompts in Copilot Lab. And you'll give that a click. Now that we're in Copilot Lab, this is\nwhere we can explore the end product. So where Copilot exists, for\nexample, 365, Word, Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, even in OneNote or\nWindows, Loop, Whiteboard, or Forms. You'll see all the prompts to try. And remember that Copilot Lab is here\nto teach us what sort of prompts exist. Now in the prompts to try, we can save\nprompts by clicking the little ribbon icon, and we can quickly save a prompt. So if I want to save this one, click it,\nand now I have all my saved prompts here. So that's a nice little flag system. Right next to it, you'll see we can filter\nfor whatever app we're using this for. Whether we want only Excel. Or word or even outlook prompts. And then what sort of\ncategory do you want? What prompt do you want to create\nsomething or edit it or understand it? Ask questions about it, or even\njust catch up and get summaries. You'll notice that when we're looking\nat the prompt, it'll explain what the prompt is, a nice little category, what's\nnew, and then you can see an example of what you would write for the prompt. You'll see in the bottom left hand\ncorner, what the prompt is coming from. So which application? In this case, this would be Microsoft 365. This one's a OneNote prompt. This one's an Outlook prompt. A Loop prompt. You can go through and find PowerPoint and\nthis is also what's really cool about this system is that you're learning, right? So if you're like, how do I add an\nimage to a slide, it'll showcase at an image of and then you can\nsay, for example, a puppy dog. To the slide. So if you don't remember that, you\ncan always just save this and then use them later on in your applications. Once you're there, and there's so\nmany different ones like shape. That's a pretty cool one. Microsoft created a bunch of these for us. We can click on show more, show more, and there's just\nso many different ones. Now once you go through the different\nprompts and you choose which ones you want to save and use inside of Copilot\nand those applications, you can then go back to the app and start using them. You'll see down here we do\nhave a couple of articles for quick tips for better prompts. So summarize this email\nin two bullet points. You'll see that you're giving\nmore detail and you're specifying that you want two bullet points. Thanks. That's something that we're going\nto learn about for Copilot is that we need to really be specific\non what we're asking it because, well, it's still a computer, right? We're still talking to computer language. Underneath it, we have FAQs. What is copilot prompt? What can I get done with copilot? How can I get the best\nresponses or results? You'll see a bunch of\ndifferent articles here. Now going back to the top, you can go into the get started\nand there's so many different ones. They have for home users, business admin. Let's say that I'm a business\nleader and I click into that. If you notice the service is unavailable\nright now, so these are services that are starting to come out slowly. There are slow rollout, so just,\nyou know, be patient with it. You'll see this one still unavailable. I believe admin is unavailable too. Oh, no, they finally got the admins up. So just wait for the business leaders\nthat should be coming out soon. And then we'll see here, Microsoft\nco pilot 365 documentation, get ready for co pilot with 365. It started with. Manage it, get trained on. They have so many different resources\nfor you to look at and utilize. Another thing that's really important with\nCoPilot that I always say is the plugins. This is going to plug into\ndifferent apps and integrations, not only with just Microsoft,\nwith other technologies as well. So take a look at some of the\nthings that are coming up. And once again, end user CoPilot resource,\nCoPilot lab is one of those resources. This lab is where you meet Copilot,\nyou understand what it can do, you can see it in everyday apps, and those\nare, once again, those prompts, and you can click the little save prompt. So this is more like that main page here,\nthis is the landing page for Copilot Lab, but it's pretty much the same\nif you go to prompts to try, it will just bring us back to where we were. What's new? That's always something that's important. I'm always reading up on the latest\nupdates for Microsoft CoPilot, um, you'll see here prompts of the month. What were the most important ones\nor what were things that weren't working that they've now updated? That's where I'm talking\nto the presentation. That's a really cool one. And you can upload document files. We'll actually talk about this in\none of our other classes when we get into using CoPilot with Word\nand also using it with PowerPoint. But as you can see here,\nimprovements based on our feedback. Before we talk about how you can\nsubmit feedback, it is important. Remember, this technology is young\nstill, so we need to really express what's working or not working for us\nto make sure that CoPilot can evolve into the tool that we need it to be. You can take a look at some of\nthe previous updates as well, our February updates, January, December,\njust click on the little carrot icon, and you'll see all of them. And I just love the way that they\ndisplay, like, all of the icons. You know that this is\nspecifically for Word. It tells you, you know, what it's for. We're actually going to be\ntalking about Word for the web. So transform your text and code table. This looks like it's only\navailable for Word for the web. So not for the desktop app. That's another thing that's really\nimportant when using Copilot. There's going to be different\nthings that work in the online version versus the desktop version. There we go. So, always remember that this is still\nCopilot Lab, we can have all the same tabs open up, we can switch between\nprompts to try, getting started. Remember, For Business Leader is one\nthat's not available right now, but it will be rolled out sooner than later. And there you go. One of the next things we're going\nto talk about is using Copilot with the online version of PowerPoint. So, I went to my Microsoft\n365 account, and I'm going to open up the online version. You'll even notice Copilot\nis here for 365, which we'll showcase in another video. But if I click into PowerPoint,\nand I create a blank presentation, I can now use my Copilot. And you'll see, just like\nbefore, there is a little bit of a difference with the ribbon. But if I click on Copilot, which is\nin my home tab still, it's going to give you the same prompts as before. So create a presentation, create\na presentation from a file, or even add a slide about. So, let's say that I want to I don't know,\nmaybe create a presentation about, let's do a presentation about Copilot, right? So I'm going to say create a\npresentation about Copilot. And let's see what it comes up with. We're using Copilot to create\na presentation about Copilot. A lot of fun. Let's pull things together. Remember that we do\nneed to add animations. But one of the things that I love about\nCopilot is that it adds in the speaker notes for us, the imagery for us as well. So there we go. Let's take a look. So right away we have the\npower of GitHub Copilot. How does GitHub Copilot work? So, I don't want to\nactually use GitHub Copilot. I'm actually going to change it. I'm going to say um, create a presentation\nabout Microsoft Copilot. And I'm very curious to see if since\nI'm doing another create a presentation if it's going to erase everything\nthat has already been resulted here. So it'll say create a new presentation\nwill replace your existing slide. So you may want to copy first. Save a copy. And I'm like, no, that's okay. Create a new draft. See if it's going to do it for me. All right, there we go. It replaced them. Look how cool this is once again. So introduction to Microsoft Copilot. It says, uses AI to suggest code\nsnippets trained on massive code base, saves time and increases productivity. Benefits of using Microsoft Copilot. And then limitations of it requires\ninternet connection may not work for all coding scenarios. I also want to add in a\ncouple of slides here. So let's do this. Let's say add a slide about co pilot with PowerPoint. And then I'll do add a slide about co\npilot with Excel and also Word, our three main Microsoft suite applications. Let's see. So why use Microsoft Copilot? Copilot uses AI. So it's now saying why instead\nof giving us what I wanted. It just says a slide about Copilot. But really I want to add a slide\nabout Copilot with PowerPoint. So let's, I'll keep this\none, but I'll say add a slide about PowerPoint working with Copilot. Something like that. That way then I'm a little more\nspecific and hopefully you'll understand what I mean and then\nput that information in there. And then we'll work with the\nother ones on a slide about Excel working with Codepilot and Word. Okay, there we go. That makes it exactly what I wanted. I don't know what this extra one was\nfor so we can delete that one out. That just kind of came\nup with a random one. But now I'm going to do the same thing. I'll just copy this. It'll be a lot easier. And let's paste this in. And then we'll do one more word, and then\nwe're going to see it all come together. And I do want to change\na couple of things here. I don't like all of the designs. It's always important to\nadd animations and designs. But as you can see, the online\nversion works very much the same as the desktop version. Let's do our last one here where\nwe talk about Word working with. And there we go. It is going to come through. There it is. All right. So Microsoft Copilot and\nWord, PowerPoint and Copilot. and Excel and Copilot. So now that I have this, I'm going to\nopen up my designer and let's see if we can change the designs because this kind\nof all looks a little all over the place. Um, let's see what we can do here. I actually do like this\ndesign, so I'll use this one. Let's see what it has on this one. I like, I like the line like this. I think this looks good. Uh, let's go with this one. Once again, keeping things consistent. I always think that's\nthe most important thing. All right. And let's go with a couple more and\nthen we'll add our animations and take a look at our final product. And last but not least. All right. So I think that looks good. It's more consistent with our theme and\njust see if they have any other ideas. That looks great. So we got our line here, then we have\nthe line going across for the rest of them, with our little plus in the circle. The last thing we have to do is just\nadd animations to this, and we'll do the simple fly in for all of these, and then we'll run the presentation,\nand let's take a look at some of the notes that they gave us. Just to showcase how consistent\nthe notes can be as well. It shouldn't make you sound like a robot\nwith these notes, but you never know. We always gotta take a look. So for now, let's take a look at what\nthis presentation will look like. I'm just gonna edit it in the\ndesktop app, even though we did it in the online version, just so\nwe can take a look at my notes. There we go. Now, let's actually take a look. At our presenter view. So this is what it looks like. We have here introduction to\nMicrosoft Copilot, and this is how I would present it, reading\nmy user notes that AI used for me. So here we go. A little fake presentation. Hello, everyone. My name is Joe. Today we're talking about\nintroduction to Microsoft CodePilot. Microsoft CodePilot is actually an AI\npowered intelligence code completion tool, and it uses machine learning to help\ndevelopers write code more efficiently. It uses natural language processing\nto suggest code snippets, functions, and classes as developer types make it\nquicker and easier to write the code. There we go. So that's pretty cool. And you go to your next one and you\nhave, boom, all the information there. And then you can talk about each one. Awesome. So as you can see, we\njust built a presentation. We've changed the design, we've\nadded some animation, and we've done this all in less than 10 minutes. As you can see, Copilot is so amazing\nand there's so much you can do with it. I hope you all enjoyed this course. And I'll see you all next time. Thanks. Welcome to PowerPoint tips\nfor amazing presentations. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. We have two modules for this course. In module one, we'll answer\nthree main questions. The first question we'll answer\nis what story do we want to tell? The second question is what\nretention techniques will be used? And then third, what are some of the\ncommon mistakes that we will avoid? We'll answer these three questions\nas we navigate through module one, and we'll learn some pretty\nnice tips along the way as well. Let's answer our first question. What story do we want to tell? Well, why are we talking\nabout storytelling here? Well, storytelling is a big deal\nin the business world currently, and we all like stories. Now remember, a story has three parts. Primarily, we have a beginning, we\nhave a middle, and we have an end. There's some other elements of\nstorytelling in here as well. But we'll go ahead and keep it\nsimple for our presentation. So the story that we want to tell\nis, well, how can we go from boring to engaging? So how can we go from a boring\npresentation to engaging presentations? So basically, we've seen some\nboring presentations lately. And what do they consist of? Well, they consist of low engagement. They also consist of low retention. And then, what happens in contrast\nwhen we experience, um, let's say, awesome presentations? What does that look like? You're given the opportunities to engage. And what else do we have? Well, we also have increased retention. So there's my actual story. How can we go from boring to engaging? Let's first talk about boring\npresentations and the effects of boring presentations. And then let's talk about some\nawesome presentations and the effects of awesome presentations as well. Thank you. Well, what I can do now, I\nwant to go ahead and convert this into a presentation. I'll go ahead and apply\nthe heading style here. So remember, we do have the\ncapability in PowerPoint to insert slides from an outline. So I'll go ahead and create\nthat here, and I'll go ahead and save that to my computer. And then I'll go ahead\nand open up PowerPoint. So here's my PowerPoint. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis first slide here. I'll go ahead and click on\nwhere it says new slide. And from there, what I want to do is\nI want to insert slides from outline. So I'll go ahead and click here. And here is my outline that I saved. So I'll go ahead and click here. I'll go ahead and click on insert\nand let's see what happens. So my story that was in Microsoft\nWord, I can see it's now become my PowerPoint presentation. Well, that first one, this is the title. So I'll just go ahead and change\nthe layout here to the title slide. And I'm good to go. If I click on the view tab, I can\nhead on over to the outline view. I can get a really nice\noutline here as well. And I can see, so this is\na really, really nice tip. Start your presentations in outline view. You can go ahead and either create your\noutline in here, or you can do like I did, create your outline in Word. As long as you convert them to the\nheading styles, then you can reuse slides from outline right in here as well. But we have our story. So we have seven slides\nthat will tell a story. And now it's just a matter of adding\ncontext to each of these, right? So for boring presentations, we can\ninsert some, some visuals in here and some context for low engagement. We can add some context in there as well. As a matter of fact, since I'm here,\nI'll go ahead and do that right now. I'll just go ahead and add some context. I'll worry about the\ndesign a little later. So for Low engagement. What does low engagement look like? Well, you're typically listening,\nand I'll just keep it simple. I'll just use keywords here. You're listening, you're waiting,\nmaybe waiting for something interesting or waiting to go home. And you're probably wondering what's\ngoing to happen next or wondering what's happening outside of this presentation. So we get to go. Low retention. What does that look like? Well, typically you are uninterested, and the value that's being offered is low. So low value. And as a result, you basically\nforget everything that was a part of the actual presentation. So you can see just by putting our story\non paper here, we're getting a nice little outline for our presentation. Okay. Now, if you experience awesome\npresentations, opportunities for engagement, well,\nwhat does that look like? Well, we have what's, we have\nactivities, I'll just put activity here. Another way to engage with your\naudience is to use a poll or something like a whiteboard. Pretty good. What about retention? Yeah. How do we increase retention? Well, we want to use visuals,\nwe want to use images, and very important, we want to be concise. We're good to go. So just like that, I'll go back to the\nnormal view here, and I already have the structure for my entire presentation. So that is the concept of storytelling. In the beginning, we had boring\npresentations that were resulting in low retention and low engagement, and While\nwe transition to awesome presentations, we experience opportunities for engagement\nand increased retention as well. Now let's go ahead and add some\ncontent to our presentation. I'm going to go ahead\nand use the designer. One of the reasons that presentations are\nboring is because they all look the same. This title slide, we don't\nhave to go with this. We can use the designer to get some ideas. So I'll go ahead and click\non the designer here. And I'll get some ideas. Now the designer likes a couple of things. It likes keywords, and it likes\nclean slides, and it likes images. So I'll go ahead and\ninsert some images in here. I'll go for a stock image, and\nI'll use these cutout people from the Microsoft stock here. And I'll just grab a couple. I'll grab this board gentleman here. And then I'll grab this\nengaged gentleman here. I'll insert those two. Now, the great thing about the\ndesigner, I don't have to worry about placing these and aligning them. The designer will take\ncare of that for me. So I have a couple of\noptions here that I can use. I can also change it a little later. Uh, this one here just has\na little orange accent. So from boring to engaging,\nthat's a pretty nice title slide. I can always change it to another one\nhere if I want to have some other ones. So this way we have a little\nbit of variety in here. I'll go ahead and stick\nwith this one here. And I'll move on over to my next one here. So boring presentations. So why do we have boring presentations? Well, again, it's because\nthey all look the same. Or maybe it's just too much text or maybe it's too much content. There's different reasons here as well. So I can go ahead and add\nsome information in here. I don't have any visuals here. The designer sometimes will\nprovide visuals for me. So let's see if I can get anything\nin here in terms of a visual. I just want to make sure it's consistent\nwith the first design that I chose here. So I'll go ahead and look\nfor something meaningful. Now what I could do as well is I can go\nahead and delete this text here and I can just focus on boring presentations. So I can just create a visual. So I'll copy and paste\nthis picture in here. Now let's see what\ndesign options I get now. So this slide will just be\nabout boring presentations. We don't necessarily need\nto have any content in here. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis content placeholder. And here we go. So almost like a section header. So we'll talk about boring presentations. I'll use this one. And there we go. Go ahead and move on to the next one. And now that we have some key words in\nhere, listening, waiting, wondering, the designer is going to provide us with some\nopportunities to incorporate Some graphics that represents those keywords as well. So I'll continue this pattern until\nI have really nice visuals, either icons or images for all of my slides. And just by doing that, we can increase\nengagement because we're incorporating text with visuals and we're keeping the\ninformation, the content on the slide, we're keeping it to a minimum or we're\ncondensing the actual information. So the reason that we have\nboring presentations is because we have low engagement. Everyone is listening and\nwaiting and wondering instead of engaging during the presentation. Well, what does the psychology\nsay about all of this? Well, according to the Stanford Graduate\nSchool of Business, an article by Matt Abrahams, People retain structured\ninformation up to 40 percent more reliably and accurately than information that is\npresented in a more free form manner. What does this have to\ndo with storytelling? Well, remember, when we're telling\na story, we're using a structure. In this case, we used a simple\nbeginning, middle, and end. We have some type of compare,\nsome type of contrast. And so just by incorporating storytelling\ninto our presentation, we have the capability to provide more structure. We can take our audience on a\njourney and we can compliment our presentation by using the story\nthat we're actually telling. So keeping this in mind, we can see\nthe immediate benefit of applying storytelling to our presentations. What does the psychology\nsay about retention? Before we start applying retention\ntechniques, it's important to understand Well, after the initial 10 minutes of a\npresentation ending, only 50 percent of our audience will remember what was said. That's pretty interesting. What about 24 hours later? Only 25 percent of our audience\nremembers what was said. And when we get towards the end\nof the week, only 10 percent remembers what was said. Here are some other statistics. We remember 10 percent of what we\nhear, 40 percent of what we hear and see, and we remember up to 90\npercent of what we hear, see, and do. Let's take a look at an example here. We have two pictures, picture on\nthe left, picture on the right. Picture on the left represents\nelementary school reading. Picture on the right. middle school reading. So in elementary school, love to read. What is it about the content that is\nin the book that makes us like to read? In contrast, what happens to the books in\nmiddle school where we don't like to read? Well, we can see, you know, it's\nmore academic once we get to middle school, but the main reason is\nthat the pictures were removed. So we don't have pictures anymore. In elementary school, reading books,\nthey have really nice pictures. We can make connections. We can draw conclusions. In middle school, they're replaced\nwith charts, tables, and a lot, a lot of heavy, heavy text. So we can use this\ninformation to our benefit. It's the first step to understanding\nhow we can increase retention. How can we increase retention? Well, if we take a look\nat our visual here. 10% if we provide our audience with\ntext, when we provide our audience with a visual, we increase it to 30%. And when we provide a simple text and\na visual, we increase retention to 65%. Now remember, the question we\nwant to answer is, how can we prevent our audience from just\nlistening, waiting, and wondering? Well, we need to find different\nways to make the presentation personal, actionable, conversational. And a couple of things that we can do\nis, first, we want to make sure that we are providing simple text and visuals. In the form of infographics, our\nbrain naturally likes infographics. We like to make connections and that's\nwhat infographics allows us to do. So instead of using a lot of text, we can\njust provide a really nice infographic to get our point across as well. As an example, let's take\na look at this slide. So we have a lot of text here. You're probably already reading\nwhat's on this slide here. That's naturally what we do. So this is just a little snippet from\nMicrosoft in terms of what smart art is. So it's saying quite a lot here. So one of the things that we can do\nis how can we convert this heavy text? How can we condense it so that it will\nbe more meaningful to our audience? Well, what I'm going to do, I'm going to\nseparate this into a few sentences here. So I've broken up. Those three sentences on different\nlines, and then I'll go ahead and convert those to bullet points. So now I have three bullets. And now what I'm going to do\nis condense each sentence. Now what I want to do is I want\neverything to fit on one line. I don't, I do not want my bullets\nto wrap to the next line, right? So try to keep your bullets on one line. Do not have them wrap. So I can accomplish that by just,\njust condensing this information here. So what is it actually telling me? It's basically telling me that I\ncan quickly and easily make a visual representation of my information. So I'll go ahead and\nrephrase this sentence here. So I'll get rid of some of\nthese filler words in here. I'll just say quickly make a visual\nrepresentation of your information. There we go. The next one here is just\ntelling us that we can choose. So I'll go ahead and\ncondense this as well. Choose from among many different layouts. This is actually saying two things. So I'll break this up a little further. So we can choose from among many\ndifferent layouts, and it helps us to effectively communicate. Our message or ideas\nfor the last one here. It's kind of saying the same thing twice. It can be used throughout office. For example, Excel, Outlook,\nPowerPoint and Word. So I'll just say can be\nused throughout office. And there we go. So we can see just by condensing\nit to four bullets here. Our bullets are not\nwrapping just four lines. It's much easier to\ndecipher this information. Now, think about an email. If you have an email, just\nhave four lines like this. You can easily decipher\nthe message and move on. As opposed to having a paragraph. It's a little more work to be\nable to decipher that as well. Okay, so that's the first step. I've condensed my information. Now what I'm going to do is\nconvert that to a SmartArt graphic. We can either use the designer\nto do this or create some for us. But let's take a look at how we can\ncreate our own SmartArt graphic. I'll go ahead and just choose\nany one that I want right here. Here's the short list. Some will have pictures. I do want one with a picture, so\nI'll go ahead and choose this one. So now what I'll do for each\nplaceholder, I'll just choose an icon that represents the visual\nchoice, communication, and office. So I'll click here. I'll go for an icon and I'll look for a visual here. Grab this one. Second one refers to choice. So again, we can use the designer\nfor this as well, but we're just going through smart art here. The next one is communication. or communicate. I'll grab this, uh, loudspeaker here. Icons are great. They come in pairs, either have\na filled color or an outline color, which is pretty cool. All right. This one is office. You could use a picture as well, but I'll\njust go ahead and use an office here. And there we go. So here's my smart art graphic. Well, A lot of empty space here. I want to see some big visuals\nand big text, so I'm going to go ahead and change it. So I'll click on the layout options\nhere and I'll just look for some other layouts that incorporates\npictures as well. I'll choose from more layouts. I'll go down to picture and let's see. I'll try. Let's try this one. See what that one looks like. See, this looks a lot better. Now I can go ahead and change\nthe colors if I want to. I can make it colorful. I can also go ahead and give it\na nice intense effect as well. So this is a pretty\nnice smart art graphic. We went from heavy text to\ncreating a nice visual here. We can even take it further and convert it to another\ntype of visual if we want to. So condense your information, convert it to a smart art graphic. We'll get that 65 percent retention. Let's discuss some other\nretention techniques. While you're presenting to your audience,\nyou can actually pull up the whiteboard. You'll notice on the bottom left that\nwe have some tools that we can use. We have things like the laser\npointer, we have the pen as well, but we also have a whiteboard. If you press the W key on your keyboard,\nthat puts us into whiteboard mode. And now we can just use\nthat space to mark up. and maybe collect some, some\nresponses from our audience. There's a lot of different\nthings that we can do. Maybe we can have three columns and\nthen we can just ask our audience. Everyone can raise their hands, right? So here's option A, option\nB, and then option C. So for option A, maybe\nwe had five responses. Option B, maybe three, and then\nmaybe option C is the winner. where we had 10 responses. So that's a simple use of the\nwhiteboard and PowerPoint. So just press the W key on your keyboard. That puts us into whiteboard mode. Now, if you're using\nother apps like Teams, Teams actually has its\nown built in whiteboard. As a matter of fact, there are\nseveral different types of whiteboards that you can use from mind maps\nand other things there as well. Now, Another really cool feature\nin Teams, we actually have what's called PowerPoint live. So check out PowerPoint live. So this basically allows us to share\nour PowerPoint presentation with our audience and it's interactive. So our audience can pretty\nmuch navigate through their presentation at their own speed. They can always come back to where\nthe presenter is actually at as well. So that is a pretty, pretty nice option. Other applications, they have their own\nversions of whiteboards that you can use. So you can either start with a\nblank whiteboard or you can go ahead and use a built in one. They're all really, really good options\nfor interacting with your audience. Now I'll go ahead and press the W\nkey to get rid of my whiteboard here. Let's go ahead and talk\nabout another thing. So we actually have the\ncapability to add forms. Forms is a really great way to\ninteract with your audience. I'll go ahead and end my\nslideshow here and I'll go ahead and click on the insert tab. Now you'll notice when you click on\nthe insert tab, We can insert a form. We can even take it a step further. If you use Power BI, you want to\nshare a visual, you can insert Power BI into here as well. But for now, I want to\ngo ahead and use Forms. It's a great way to collect\ndata from your audience. It automatically connects to\nthe forms that I've created from the Microsoft Forms app. I'll go ahead and insert\nthis PowerPoint form here. So it's asking me, do I want to collect\nresponses offline or do I want to present for interactive meetings? Well, I want to see real time feedback. So I'll go ahead and choose this option. So my form is loading right here\ninside of my PowerPoint slide and we can see this is how it looks. So this is pretty nice. It comes with the QR code. We can also copy and paste the link. So different ways for us to be\nable to engage with our audience. Over here on, I'll go ahead and show\nyou, this is what the form looks like. So I'll be filling out the form. So I'll go ahead and click on start now. I'll put in my name and my\nfavorite feature in PowerPoint. So there are different types of responses. So this one is going to be a word cloud. So I'll say smart art and ideal amount of slides\nin the presentation. I'll say 12. We'll go ahead and submit the form. And it should show up. There you go. So we can see the first response is Mo. I'll go ahead and put this\ninto full screen mode here. And as a matter of fact, I'll go\ninto, I can close this out and I'll go into presentation mode. I'll go to reading view to keep it simple. So this is pretty nice. So as everyone starts entering the\nform, you'll see the information here. If I click on the next response\nhere, I can see smart art. I'll go ahead and add another response. to see how that's collected. So I just added another response. So we can see we have two responses\nnow in the word cloud, and we can see that we're collecting. So this is a word cloud. So if we have many participants\nthat write smart art, this will appear bigger than the others. So that's pretty cool. And then of course, the last\nquestion, this is a multiple choice. So 50 percent says 12, 50 percent says 18. I can change it to a bar down\nhere on the bottom if I want to. We get a nice bar there, or I can also change this to all responses\nto kind of see all of them here as well. So pretty, pretty nice. So those are really two ways\nthat we can engage with our audience and increase retention. Get your audience active, allow\nthem to have some opportunities to participate and to engage as well. So we have. Microsoft Teams Whiteboard. We have Microsoft Teams PowerPoint Live. We have the PowerPoint Whiteboard. We also have Microsoft Forms\nthat we can integrate as well. Let's go ahead and answer\nour third question. Well, what are some of the mistakes\nthat we are going to avoid? Well, some common mistakes that we\nsee in PowerPoint, just to name a few, all the slides look the same. You're expecting the same type of\ndelivery, the same type of, of content, and you're expecting to not be engaged. So we've already seen how we can\novercome some of those issues as well. But some of the common mistakes is not\ntaking our audience into consideration. So we do want to present based on the\naudience that we are presenting to. Now, one of the things that we kind\nof strike out on is our audience is looking for key conclusions. So they want some summaries. They want some insightful data, right? How is this beneficial to me? So when you're building a presentation,\nyou need to consider who is your audience and how will they benefit\nfrom your actual presentation? What are some of the key insights that\nyou want to provide to your audience? We want to provide conclusions\nand not a lot of just random information also looking for insights. So what is the takeaway? What is the benefit? And a really big one here. A lot of times we use PowerPoint\nto present a lot of data, which is very, very difficult to do. So to overcome these, what we want\nto do is if we need to represent data, we do not want to use text. We want to use tables, or you\nwant to use charts as well. Now, one of the things that we can do,\nif we do want to represent some type of data, again, if you're using Power BI, we\ncan insert a Power BI report right here, and that makes it much more efficient\nfor everyone to see the data and be able to interact with the data as well. We can also insert a chart. So we can insert a table. We can insert a chart in here as well. But if you already have an existing\nchart or table in Excel, you can actually just copy and paste\nit right here into PowerPoint. I'm going to go ahead and insert a\nnew slide and I'll change the layout. I just actually, this is fine. I'll put my table and my chart on here. I'll open my Excel. So here's my Excel. I can see I have a table here\nand I also have a chart so I can just copy this chart. And I'm going to paste this chart\nright into this content placeholder and there is our actual chart. Now, if I wanted to add the table in\nhere, I can go ahead and do that as well, but I don't necessarily need the table\nbecause I already have the chart here. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis content placeholder. Now I can make my chart a little bigger. And I am good to go. So let's go ahead and\ncall this sales data. Now, the really nice thing about this\nchart as well is we can actually, you know, create a little bit of intrigue\nhere so we can animate the actual chart. So I'll go ahead and click on\nthe animations tab here and I'll use a simple animation. The chart comes in as one, but what\nI can do is if I click on the effect options, I have a lot of options in here. in terms of the sequence. So I can reveal the chart piece by\npiece, maybe by series or by category or by element in the category. This is super useful if you have\na chart that has a lot of data. You don't want to just present all of\nthe information to your audience at once. You can break it down piece by piece. So I'm going to choose the by series\nand let's see what that looks like. So we can see Q1 comes in first. And then Q2 comes in second, and\nthen the total line comes in third. It's also interactive. So if you move your mouse over it,\nit shows you the actual numbers. I'll choose the next one by category. So it comes in the first cluster. Here's M Jones, Q1, Q2 in total, and\nthen Cohen and then Sanchez and Gupta. The next one here is\nby element and series. So it's Q1 for each and then Q2. and then the total. So that is pretty cool. So we can go ahead and just\nkind of animate our chart. We can pause before we move on there. And then finally we have\nby element and category. So it's just literally going\nfrom left to right one by one. I think I like by element in the series. I'll go ahead and choose that one. I'll go into, I'll go into reading view. Let's see what that looks like. So here's my chart. And on each click, I can reveal a\nQ1 for Jones, Cohen, Sanchez, Gupta. Now we're in quarter two. And then we have our totals as well. So we can animate our chart. We can also animate our smart art as well. So pretty, pretty cool. Another mistake is not\nusing the presenter view. The presenter view is a really,\nreally good option here. I'll go ahead and click on slideshow\nand I'll go ahead and make sure that I have presenter view turned on. And I want to show my\npresentation on my other monitor. I want this current screen\nto show my presenter view. So the presenter view comes with a\nlot of really, really nice tools. We can use subtitles if you\nwant to, and that's very, very helpful for our audience. I'll go ahead and turn those on. We can always turn those off later. And we have the different settings\nhere that we can set as well. I'll go ahead and run my presentation. So I'll go ahead and\nfrom this current slide. So here's the actual presenter view. We can see on the bottom, it's actually\ntranslating my speech into text. So that's very, very\nhelpful for our audience. I'll go ahead and turn that off. I'll just click on toggle subtitles here. So this is really nice. The presenter view allows us to do\nsome really, really nice things. But overall, it allows\nus to own our content. Because the presenter view,\nwe can see this window. The only thing that our audience can\nsee is what's inside of this frame. So I'm on my other screen. They can only see whatever\nis being presented in here. They cannot see all of my\ntools down here that I have. They cannot see the notes for my slide. And also once I go back, we\ncan see that we can see what, what slide is coming next. So this is a really,\nreally nice tool for us. It helps us to own our content. Well, what does that mean? Well, we're in control. We can see what's coming next. We can see the slide that's coming next. We can see the animations\nthat are coming next. For example, if I go back here, I can see that my chart is\ngoing to be displayed next. If I click here and I can see the\nanimations before they come up. So when you have a lot of detail on\nyour slide, it's pretty difficult to remember the sequence of events. So the presenter view allows\nus to take control of that. Now for each of the\nslides, we have our notes. So now notice I only have three graphics\nin here, but here are my talking points. I can use my notes for my talking points. So this way I'm not reading\nnecessarily what's on my slide. I'm just giving context to\nwhat's on my slide here as well. All right, so I can say, well, what\nwe can do is copy and paste tables. from Excel or other applications. We want to use animations in a clever\nway by breaking down our content and we want to keep it concise. So we want to try to stick\nthe three concepts per slide. Well, why three concepts? Well, because our brain naturally\nunderstands things in threes, breakfast, lunch, dinner, right? Morning, afternoon, night. So the presenter view allows\nus to own our content. The notes area allows us to provide\ntalking points for each of our slides so that we were just summarizing the\nslide instead of reading everything that's on our slide as well. And then of course, when we're\nusing the presenter view, it helps us to keep the slide simple. We can add our contents in our notes. And that way it's not\noverloading our slides as well. Now in here, we have a lot of\nother tools that we can use. Sometimes you want to be able\nto navigate to another slide. If I click here, my audience\nis still seeing this slide. They're not seeing my,\nmy slide layouts here. I can go ahead and just jump to another\nslide if I want to, and I'm good to go. Some other things that we can do, so we\ncan go ahead and black out the screen. And we have a lot of different things\nin here that we can use as well. So definitely use the presenter\nview because it gives us some really, really nice benefits. Helps you own your content. Now when you own your content, your\naudience will have more confidence in you and they'll be more engaged\nbecause you own your content. When you're summarizing your slides\ninstead of reading it verbatim, that also increases retention. And when you're keeping\nyour slides simple. Keeping it to three concepts per slide,\nyou're helping out your audience as well. For Module 2, we have a few questions\nthat we want to ask as well. We have three questions,\njust like Module 1. The first question that we want to ask\nis, well, what do we want to customize? The second question is, what layout\nconcepts do we want to create? And third, which new tool\nwould we like to use? So a lot of this will\nbe about customizations. We'll take a deeper dive\ninto the slide master. What do we want to customize? Well, let's go ahead and make\nour own theme and then we'll go ahead and customize some of the\nexisting layouts that we have here. And we can also make consistent changes. to our presentation. So to customize the theme, so I\ncan click on the design tab and I can choose one of these themes. So basically what is the theme? It's a set of colors, fonts, and effects. So all these different themes,\nthey have their own set of colors, their fonts, and effects as well. Well, what if I wanted to go ahead\nand maybe brand my PowerPoint? I can go ahead and do that. Or maybe I'm just not. You know, I just don't want to\nuse any of these existing themes. Well, let's make our own. I'll click on the view tab and then\nI'll head on over to the slide master. And this is where I can make all\nkinds of changes to my presentation. But for now, let's just\ngo ahead and make a theme. If I scroll to the top, I'll see that\nthis slide, make sure to click on there. So this is the actual master slide. So notice that they're Significantly\nlarger than the others. These are the different layouts. For example, here's the title slide,\ntitle and content, to content. I'll click on that slide\nhere on the very, very top. Once I'm in the slide master, there's\na lot of things that we can do. We'll explore, but for now, what\nwe want to do is we want to go ahead and choose a set of colors. a font and effects for\nour entire presentation. We can even go ahead and\nchange the background styles. So instead of choosing one of\nthese existing themes, I'm going to go ahead and make my own. So I'll choose a color palette here. Now notice you can actually make\nyour own color palette as well. So here's some different\ncolors that we can make. I'll go ahead and scroll down. So here's the newer office theme. Here's the older office theme. So maybe I just want\nsomething like a blue green. I'll go ahead and choose blue green here. And I'll go ahead and choose my fonts. So maybe I'll go for,\nlet's see, I'll go for the font and for the effects. I like a glossy effect. So that's it. I've chosen my color palette. I've chosen my font. And I've chosen my effects here as well. If I click on the fonts drop down,\nI can go ahead and customize the fonts and I can basically specify\nwhat I want my headings to look like and what the body to look like. So I can actually change the headings\nif I want to do something else. Maybe I'll make this, let's see, not the\nbest menu to kind of scroll through here. I'll go for Georgia. for my headings, and I have\nGaramond here for my body. I'll go ahead and press save, and I'll\nclose the master view to kind of see what that looks like, just to confirm. So I can see I now have the Georgia\nfont for all of my headings and titles, and I have the Garamond here. So mission accomplished. So I'll go back into the slide master, and\nI want to go ahead and save this theme. So I'll go ahead and click\non the themes drop down here. And on the very, very bottom,\nI'll click on save current theme and I'll just call this one Garamond and Georgia. I'll go ahead and press save\nand I'm good to go. So that's how we make our own theme. I'll close the master view. And now if I were to open\nup a new PowerPoint file and I click on the design tab. I'll see, I should be able to find that. So it's right here. It's the Garamond and Georgia theme. So that's how we can make\nour own theme in PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and customize\nthe existing layouts. So many of us do this, you know, we'll\ncome here and we'll change the font color. We'll change the font size. We'll come in here and change\nthe type of bullets as well. And then we'll go to the next slide and\nwe'll do the same thing there again. Well, we don't have to do that. Let's go ahead and customize the existing\nlayouts here so that we can have a uniform font, color, size, effect and maybe we\nwant the check marks here for our bullets instead of the original bullet points. I'll click on the View tab. I'll head on over back\nto the Slide Master. Now the current layout that\nI have selected, this is the title and content layout. So if I make any changes to that layout,\nall of my slides that are title and content will inherit these changes. So I'll go click on the slide master here. If I scroll up here, so notice\nthat I'm currently on the title and the content layout. If I hover over it, it tells me that\nit's being used by slides two through 11. So all those slides, 2 through 11,\nis going to inherit any changes that I make to the layout here. I'll keep it simple. I'll just go ahead and\nclick on the title here. And I'll make this a blue color. I'll make it bold as well. Now, for the first, uh, I'll go\nahead and change my list here. So I'll change these to check marks\ninstead of those basic bullets. I'll also go ahead and\nclick on that first line. I'll make that another color as well. I don't have a lot of colors to choose\nfrom, just some basic colors here. So maybe I'll go for the darker, different shade of blue. I'll go for this one. And that's it. So I'll go ahead and close the\nmaster view and let's see if that will affect that layout. And there we go. So we can see slides 2 through\n11, they have all inherited the changes that I've made\nto that layout here as well. So that looks pretty good. But maybe I want something else\nlike a little accent down here. I'll go back into the slide master and\nI'll go ahead and insert a basic shape. I'll just put a little accent down here, something like that. I can also remove the Footers\ndon't need those right now. So just a nice little accent down here. And let's see what that looks like. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And there we go. So all of my layouts, title and content\nlayout now has those changes that I made to the title, the bullets. And now I have my little\naccent in here as well. Maybe I'll change that accent. Let's see what other\ncolors I have available. Not a lot, because again, this, this\nwas a pretty, not a lot of colors. I'll go for something that\ngives a little bit of contrast. Let's see what that looks like. It looks a little better. So there we go. So that's how we can go ahead\nand customize the layouts. When it comes to customizing what we\nwant, we can see that the slide master allows us to customize our own theme. We can customize existing layouts to\nmake universal changes to all of the slides that has that particular layout. And we were able to make some\nconsistent changes as well, such as specifying the name of the font for\nour headings and the font for the body. of our slides as well. But let's answer the next question. So what layout concepts\ndo we want to create? Now we did talk a little bit in\nmodule one about the rule of three. So basically the rule of three,\nwe want to keep everything simple. I want to keep it to about\nthree concepts per slide. Again, because we naturally understand\nthings in threes, breakfast, lunch, dinner, morning, noon, and night. So if we can go ahead and just kind\nof keep everything to three, then we'll be helping our audience out. So I'll go ahead and head\non over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab. And, but before I do that, if I click\non the dropdown here for new slides, I can see that I have title and content. I have two content and I have comparison,\nbut I don't have one that has three. content. So I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to the slide master. Now I have two options. I can go ahead and duplicate this\nslide and then just go ahead and add two more content placeholders\nand just kind of align them. So I can do that. I'll have less work to do that way. Or what I can do So I can actually just\ngo ahead and insert a new layout and that will allow me to pretty much position\neverything in the way that I want to. Let's go ahead and do both. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthis title and content layout. Here it is. I want to rename it. I'll just call this one three columns. And what I'll do is I'll just\ngo ahead and reduce the width of this current placeholder. I'll click on the shape format here. I want it to be about 3. 3. So I'll put it there and I'll\nalign it to the far left. Or actually what I'll do is\nI'll align it to the middle. And then my others will be based\non the position of this one. So I'll go ahead and insert a\nplaceholder so I can be very specific just for text, just for picture, chart. Well, I want content. I want to be able to\ninsert anything there. So I'll go ahead and draw this one here. And I'll just make sure\nit's the same width, 3. 3, same height. Good to go. I'll align this one to the left. Alright, one more to go. Just use those temporary guidelines. And I'll align this all\nthe way to the right. So there we go. So there is our three content layout. Now I do want to go ahead\nand center align the title. So I'll center align that. I can see right now that I have check\nmarks here for bullets, but I have the regular bullets for my others. Remember, we're editing\nan existing layout. So I'll just go ahead and change\nthe bullets, keep them consistent. So I'll go for the check marks here. And the check marks here. Good to go. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And let's go ahead and insert that slide. I'll click on new. Here is my three column layout. And there he goes. Now I have three content placeholders. I can add an image,\nicons, anything I want to. And these here as well. So this will be my three column layout. I'll go ahead and just\nadd some detail in here. Let's see. I'll go for a quick chart. I'll just go with the defaults. So there's my chart right there. And that first content\nplaceholder, uh, over here, I'll go for, I'll go for an icon. I'll go for a chart as well. Great. Icons don't really fit inside\nof our content placeholders. So we just need to kind of\nmake them a little bigger. And then over here I can go\nahead and insert, uh, let's see, I'll insert a stock image. There we go. That one fit really nicely here. So that is how we can create\nour own three column layout. Let's go ahead and\ncreate another one here. I'll go back to my view tab. I'll go back to the slide master. And now what I want to do is I want\nto go ahead and insert another layout. All right, so I'll click on insert layout. And this one will also be, I'll have\nthree concepts in here, but I just want to move things around here. So I'm going to go ahead and move\nmy title over here like that. And also, just make\nsure that it's centered. And I'll click on the shape format. And, let's see, I'll go\nback to the home tab. And I want to make sure the\ntext is aligned to the middle. So I'm good to go there. Alright, so there is my text. I do want to change the color, so\nI'll make it that nice dark brown. blue here or a little darker blue. I'll go for that. So I want to go ahead and\ninsert three content layouts. This time it will be a little different. I'll go ahead and add, kind\nof stack them like this. So it's going to be one\ncolumn, but three rows. So I'll go ahead and go\nback to the slide master. I'll insert a placeholder\nand I'll just go for content. So same as I did before, I'll\ngo ahead and draw this out. I'll use my footers on the bottom\nas a guide, in terms of the width, and we're good to go. Right now, I'll make the height\ntwo inches, and then I'll go ahead and repeat that process here. So, two more placeholders, same width and height, there we go, and then one more to go, and So there we go. So that's a pretty nice layout as well. I do want to fix this though. I'll move this up just a\nlittle bit right there. And that looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and rename this one. So I'll rename the layout and\nI'll call this one one by three. Right, so one column, three rows, and\nI'll go ahead and click on rename. I could change the bullets here as well\nif I want to, but I'll leave them for now. And I'll go ahead and close\nthe master view and I'll go ahead and insert that layout. So here's my one by three. So pretty cool. Now I can go ahead and do the same thing. Let's see if I can convert this\none to the other layout here. So if I change the layout of this\nexisting one to one by three. So, did a pretty good job, right? So, just kind of use the existing\nplaceholders and stack them. But, um, I would need a wider picture\nto take advantage of this placeholder. My chart is okay. And I can go ahead and just, um, enlarge\nsome of these other items here as well. So, pretty, pretty cool. Let's go ahead and create a clean slide. We'll continue the concept\nof the rule of three. Another concept of the rule of three\nhelps us to create clean slides. We'll take a look at the rule of thirds. So the rule of thirds is\npretty popular and prevalent in photography and filmmaking as well. So how can we apply the rule of\nthirds to our presentation here? I'll go ahead and insert a blank slide. And then what I'll do is I'll go\nahead and turn on the, the grid lines. So I'll click on the view tab and\nI want to turn on the, the guides first of all, and then I'll turn on\nthe grid lines and the ruler as well. So if I turn the guides on, this\ngives me the, the vertical guide here and the horizontal guide. I can actually add more guides\nif I want to, which I'll, I'll do that in just a little bit. Here is the ruler. So the ruler shows me where I\nam horizontally and vertically. So right now, I am on the three\nhorizontally and two vertically. Well, what the rule of thirds\nsays is that when you have a frame, you want to go ahead and\ndivide it into, into three, right? So we want three rows and three columns. So if I were to draw a line, let's\nsay right here, This is not exact. We'll, we'll get the exacts\nin just a little bit here. So I'll go ahead and\njust put two lines here. So we now have three columns,\nbut we also want three rows. I'll go ahead and draw another line here. I'll go ahead and draw\nanother one down here as well. So now we have three rows\nand we have three columns. The intersection of these different\npoints here So these four points, guess what these are called? These are actually called PowerPoints. So these are actual PowerPoints. And what the rule of thirds says is\nthat when we align our objects on those points, then it's a great way\nto design our slides and to just capture our audience's attention. visually. So that's the idea behind\nthe rule of thirds. So if I have an object, I want to\nmake sure to place that object, right? So if I have three objects on this\nslide, have one here, have one here, and maybe the big one here. So that's a more natural kind of\nlayout to capture our attention. So that is the concept\nof the rule of thirds. So we need to go ahead and just\nidentify those different points. As you can see, did a pretty good\njob in terms of the columns here, but my rows are too spaced out. So let's go ahead and establish where\nthose PowerPoints are on our canvas. I'll keep it simple. I'll go ahead and add a guideline here. at the two and a half mark\nhorizontally on each side. So two and a half on each. And then we'll go for a one\nand a half on the vertical. So I'll go ahead and insert a guideline. So I'll right click here and\nI'll add a vertical guide. And I can move this over to\nthe two and a half right there. Go ahead and add another one. Another vertical guide. I'll move this one over here\nto two and a half as well. And then I'll go ahead and\nadd my two horizontal guides. This one will be at 1. 5 and the other one will be at 1. 5 here as well. So by doing that I could go ahead\nand highlight my PowerPoints. Here's one. Here's two. It's not exact. But here we go. So here are our four PowerPoints. So just turning on those grid\nlines, and now if I go to any slide, I can see those grid lines. So now I can leave them turned on,\nand I can go ahead and just make sure that I'm aligning my different\nobjects to those PowerPoints as well. So that's how we can set up our\nslides for the rule of three. And then we can actually create a\nlayout that has content placeholders on these four different PowerPoints. Now, here's an example of putting the\nrule of thirds into practice here. I have three objects here on\nmy slide, and this is typically how we see them laid out. We always have on the top, we\nalways, always have our placeholder, and then we'll have our content\nplaceholder, and then we'll have another one here to the left. But, I want to go ahead and\napply the rule of thirds. So I'll move my picture\nhere on the PowerPoints. I'll actually increase\nthe size of the picture. I'll place that right\nhere on my PowerPoints. And for this one here, I'll\nplace this on the PowerPoint down here on the bottom right. And for this one, it\ndoesn't need to be that big. I'll go ahead and resize this one and\nI'll place this on this PowerPoint. I'll go ahead and increase\nthe font size here. Make sure they're consistent. And I'll just go ahead and do that. So I'll go ahead and turn off my grid\nlines here, my guides and my ruler. And if we take a look at this particular\nlayout, we can see that this makes a lot more sense because I've placed\nthem on the actual PowerPoints. Just need to align them here a little bit. And this looks much more balanced\nthan the traditional, you know, title content here and all of this\nempty space over here as well. So this is a really, really nice concept. Again, just identifying those PowerPoints\nand aligning our objects on those PowerPoints helps us to really create\nreally nice and balanced slides. Let's create a reusable slide. Now, if I click on my new slide here,\nI can see that the slides that we've created so far, we have layouts in here. So we have the different\ncontent placeholders and they're laid out in different ways. But in this case, what I want to\ndo is create a reusable slide. So it will have the layout. It will also have the\ncontents in there as well. I want to create a custom title slide. Now, I did use the designer. I just added a title and a subtitle,\ninserted a picture here, and the designer kind of gave me some pretty nice ideas. These are what the modern\ntitle slides look like. They incorporate pictures. We have our text and we have some little\naccents in here, some little shapes. For example, for this particular one. So here's our picture. We can see that the picture is in a frame. So that's one of the\npicture styles that we used. It's overlaying an actual rectangle\nshape that has that grayish fill color. Over here to the left, this is either\nan image or three individual rectangles with that gray shape here as well. And then of course we have our\ncontent placeholder for the title and the subtitle as well. So that's pretty much what that is. Whenever you add an object like an\nimage, a shape, or an icon to the Slide Master, it gets locked onto the canvas. So notice I cannot interact\nwith these different shapes. I can interact with this picture\nbecause I inserted that picture. But all of these here are just our basics. Remember when I inserted this\nlittle accent down here for all of my title and content placeholders? Just a little shape. We cannot interact with it. So I want to go ahead and insert\na custom title slide because they don't all have to look like this. Let's surprise our audience by\nproviding them with a really, really nice opening slide. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go to the slide master and I want\nto go ahead and insert a new layout. So I'll click on insert layout here. And I'll go ahead and\nrename this right away. This is going to be Title 2. There we go. I'll go ahead and hide the\ntitle and the footers for now. I can bring them back later. And I'll go ahead and look\nfor a really nice picture. Now, I'll have a couple of\noptions when I insert my picture. I can either choose a picture that will\ntake up the top two thirds of the slide, and then down here I can have my title. title, my subtitle, maybe even\nmy, my logo down here somewhere. Or I can go for a more of\na two column orientation. Maybe the You. Left two thirds and then a third column\nright, I'll have my title, subtitle, and then maybe my logo down here. So it all depends on the dimensions of\nthe picture that I, that I get here. So I'll look for a really nice picture. I'll click on the, the insert tab here. I'll look for pictures. I'll grab a stock image. And once I find the picture, I'll\ngo ahead and start working with it. So I have my picture here, go\nahead and align this to the left. Now with this picture is pretty big. So what I can do is I can\ngo ahead and get some ideas. I can either crop this to a shape\nto kind of get an idea here. So that's one thing that I can do. I can crop it to a shape, give\nit a nice modern look and feel. I'll go ahead and undo that. I can also crop it to a particular ratio. So if I wanted this to be more of\n16 by 9, it will crop it for me and offer me that 16 by 9 ratio. It actually looks pretty good. I don't need much of the detail that's\nat the bottom of the picture here. So I'll go ahead and leave it like that. So at this point, it's\nstill taking up a lot. I would need to kind of trim it\nso that I can at least see the one third of the right column there. So what else can I do? Well, I can probably crop some of\nthe detail over here on the left. So go ahead and do that. Don't want to crop too much though,\nbecause I do want to catch some of these nice colors from that, that monitor. So let's see, I'll align\nthis to the center. Now I can use one of the, I can put\nthis in the frame, maybe like that. Right, then I'll go ahead and\njust insert a basic shape. So I'll go for a rectangle. I'll put that over here, just\nto kind of fill out that space. I'll send it to the back, so\nmy picture's overlaid on it. And for that rectangle, I can give it\na, give it its own formatting here. So, what a nice contrast. So I'll go for that. That looks pretty good so far and\nnow I can go ahead and return my title and so here's my title and\nnow I can put that over here like that I want to make sure it's center\naligned so I'll center it and make it a little smaller doesn't need to be\nthat big so 40 and as far as the color I can leave the color as is right now\nor I can use the eyedropper to pick up one of the colors from inside of here. I think that's what I want to do,\nor maybe I'll just go with this nice blue, dark blue over here. Not the color I was looking for. Let's see. I'll go for this one. I'll insert another\nplaceholder here for text. This will be for my subtitle. I'll get rid of the bullets. And I'll also delete the second,\nthird, fourth, and fifth levels. I'll go ahead and center\nalign this as well. And, um, at this point it's just\na matter of what color do I want and what size do I want this to be. So 28, that's perfectly fine. And let's see what other\ncolors I have here. Let's see if I can pick up one\nof the colors from the picture. Maybe Let's see. I'll go for There's a white background. I'll go for this one. Not too much. I need a better contrast. For now, I'll just leave it as black. Right, and I'm good to go. So there is my custom slide. I'll go ahead and make sure\nthis is renamed properly. Title 2. There we go. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And I'll go ahead and insert that\nnew slide so we can see here it is, has the content in there already. There we go. So that's a pretty nice\nlooking title slide. And I'll just say present like a pro and I'll just say learn with us. So there we go. So pretty nice. So that's how we can\ncreate a reusable slide. Now, if I want to make any other\nchanges to this, I can, I can just go back into the slide master. Maybe I'll change the color of this one. Maybe I can go ahead and add\na logo down here as well. I'll go back into the Slide Master. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert just a basic logo here. I'll go for this. I'll go ahead and make that really small. I'll just put it down here. Make sure it's centered. Yeah, I have that gray\nbackground in there. Maybe I'll change the background. And I'm good to go. Once I close the master view, I can\nsee that that slide has been updated. Let's take a look at a few tips\nand or some of the newer features that are available in PowerPoint. If we click on the review tab, we\nhave the check accessibility and if we click on the slide show, we\nhave the rehearse with coach option. These are two tools that will run,\nthey'll analyze your presentation for you and provide you with some feedback. We also have the high contrast\nmode that's available. I'll start with the high\ncontrast mode first. It will be available depending\non the type of colors in the background that you're working with. I'll go back to the home tab here. I'll click inside of\nmy content placeholder. Now I do have a I do want to change\nthe color of the content placeholder. So if I click on the shape format\nhere, I can change the shape fill. And typically we're dealing\nwith, we can change the color to an existing theme color. But the newer feature allows us\nto choose only colors that may be easier for others to read. So I can turn on high contrast here, and\nnow we can see it just kind of filters out the colors that will look pretty,\nthat will work well with this background. So I can go ahead and apply one\nof these and I'll be good to go. So at this point, I don't\nhave that much to choose from. I'll go ahead and choose\nthis blue accent six. We can see that works pretty\nwell with this background here as well, and I'm good to go. As far as the text, let's see if\nI were to highlight this chunk of text here, let's see if I have\nthe, so I do have the high contrast available for the text here as well. Now that I've changed\nthe background color. And so it's telling me\nthat this color works well. So these are all the colors that will\nwork well with that particular background because they are high contrast. Notice at the bottom, we\neven have additional colors that we can use here as well. So that's a really, really nice tool, a\nbig help when it comes to just selecting the right colors in our presentation. It's not always available. For example, let's see if it\nwill be available here, right? So it's not always available. It's only available for\nnon transparent colors. So that is a pretty nice option. So the next time you're choosing\nyour font or you're changing the color of an object, go ahead and\nturn on the high contrast only. The other tool that we can take a\nlook at is the Accessibility Tool. Now, if I click on the Review tab,\nhere is the Check Accessibility Tool. And this is a pretty nice tool. It offers a lot of insight\nand provides a lot of feedback and a lot of fixes as well. I'll go ahead and click\non the Accessibility here. If you hover over it, it tells\nyou exactly what it does. What it does, it says, let's\nmake sure that your file follows accessibility best practices and it'll\nhelp us fix issues along the way. So I'll click here. It opens up the pane over\nhere to the, to the right. So a lot of the feedback that\nwe'll see here is things that are missing for screen readers. Now, typically what I like to do\nin here is look for any errors. text that's hard to read. So any kind of color contrast\nis difficult to read. I don't have any right now, which is good. So that means for my entire presentation,\nall the text can be read easily. So if I click here, it says\nmissing alternative text. If I click here, it brings me right to\nthat place in my actual presentation. So I don't have a caption\nfor this shape here. And the screen reader is going to try to\nfigure out exactly what this shape is. So what I can do is go ahead\nand add a description here, the recommended actions, right? Or I can just mark it as decorative. So I can go ahead and do that. If I go ahead and click\non another item here. So I'll go ahead and add a description\nand I'll just say a horizontal line and I'm good to go. Right. So, then we have the reading order. This is basically telling us that we\nneed to go, I'm missing the title. So that's why it's\ngiving me an issue here. So I can verify the order in which\nit actually appears here as well. But what I want to do, I'm going\nto go ahead and purposely create a hard to read text contrast here. Let's see. I'll go for another color. I'll change the background, actually. Change this to, let's say, here we go. So we finally triggered it,\nshowing us that we have hard to read, uh, text contrast. So if I click here, it brings\nme right to that place. If I go to another slide, if I\nclick here, brings me right to that slide and it's giving me recommended\nactions to change the font color or to change the fill color. So, if I do something like change the fill\ncolor to, let's say, black, it's corrected and so it disappears from here as well. So that is the Accessibility Checker,\num, a lot of really robust features, but those are the basics of how\nthe Accessibility Checker works. If you are creating presentations\nand you're distributing them, you want to make sure that you\nrun the Accessibility Checker. to check all these errors and\ncorrect them here as well. Let's take a look at one more tool,\nand this is a really nice tool. It's the Rehearse with Coach tool. I'll click on my slideshow tab\nhere, and I'll go ahead and click on Rehearse with Coach. The rehearse with coach will\ngive us real time feedback. So this allows us to rehearse with\nthe built in PowerPoint coach. We will receive a detailed report giving\nus constructive criticism and feedback. So it's like rehearsing with a colleague\nand they're giving you feedback. I'll head on over to my first\nslide and I'll just cover the first couple of slides. I'm not going to cover the\nentire presentation here. I'll just cover the first\nMaybe four or five slides here. I'll click on Rehearsal of Coach. Here we go. It's going to show me real time feedback\nI'll go ahead and start rehearsing Welcome to PowerPoint tips\nfor amazing presentations If you want to present like a pro\nmake sure to come and learn with us In module one, we'll answer three questions And once we answer those You\nThree different questions. We'll take a deeper\ndive into them as well. First, we want to talk about\nthe concept of storytelling. So what story do you want to tell? The main concept of storytelling is being\nable to add structure to our outline and adding slides for additional context. Storytelling takes our\naudience on a journey. And it also increases engagement\nbecause we are providing structure to our presentation. Now, what retention\ntechniques will be used? It depends on what the science says. And based on that, we can\ngather some insight in terms of how to increase retention. When it comes to retention, it's all\nabout, well, what do we remember? How much are we retaining? And what opportunities will we\npresent, provide our audience with text, speech, visuals, or all three? Here are some of the common\nmistakes that we want to avoid. Pretty much too much content. We want to condense content\nas much as possible. and use our notes as talking\npoints for our individual slides. So I'll press the escape key there\njust to kind of take a look and see. So here's the actual report that pops up. So we can see it's pretty exhaustive. So it gives me a summary. The amount of slides I\nrehearsed, the total time. I did not use any filler words\nlike um, and okay, and actually. No repetitive language. So I used a variety of word choice. That was pretty good. Uh, inclusiveness, my pace is just right. So 132 words per minute. So this is a really, really nice tool. So I highly encourage you to make\nuse of this tool before you present. You can practice over and over. Um, you can click on rehearse\nagain, and you can really nail down your presentation, right? Originality, I avoided reading\nthe text out loud on my slides. Right. So again, this is a huge tip right here. So the rehearsal coach gives us some\nreally nice feedback and allows us to implement some of the tips that\nwe've talked about here as well. Right. My pitch got a little low, so I\nneed to pick that up a little bit. I've been talking a lot, losing my voice,\nbut I need to go ahead and pick that up just a little bit here and I'm good to go. So that is the rehearse with coach tool. Let's take a look at some other tips here. We did kind of mention them, but\nhere, one of the first tips is that bullets have their own rules. So when you're working with bullets on\nyour slide, three bullets are ideal, four is okay, five may be a bit much. Also want to make sure that you\nkeep bulleted items on one line. We do not want to wrap\nthem to another line. So, so that means we need to\ncondense the information that we're providing to our audience. Also, when it comes to font size, the\nminimum font size should be around 20. There are different professionals\nthat have different opinions on this, but in my experience, at least 20,\nanything smaller than 20 will be very, very difficult to see depending on\nthe type of display that's being used. Keep in mind that some\nfonts are naturally taller. and wider than others. And some are actually thinner\nand shorter than others as well. So depending on the type of font that\nyou see, you select, you may need to go ahead and make it even larger than 20 in\norder to be able to see them properly. And then use the eyedropper. Eyedropper is a really, really nice tool. It allows you to keep\nthe color scheme uniform. So you can use the eyedropper for text. You can use it for shapes, text boxes,\nand even content placeholders as well. So use all those tips and we'll be\nable to really create some really nice, engaging and dynamic presentations. Let's recap our learning together here. We want to be able to tell a\nstory for our presentation. We want to prepare for engagement and\nretention using some of the techniques that we learn through this course. We want to avoid common mistakes, mainly\nproviding too much content on a slide. We also want to be able to customize\nour presentation efficiently by using the Slide Master. Saving a lot of time by\nmaking universal changes. We also want to create the appropriate\nlayouts that works best for our audience and what we're trying to communicate and\nhow we're trying to communicate as well. And then make sure to utilize the\nnewer tools that are available and feel free to always check out what's new. Maybe there is a new tool that was not\ndiscussed for this course here as well. Don't forget to like and subscribe. Welcome to Microsoft\nPowerPoint introduction. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. Let's take a look at what we'll\nbe covering today for this very popular presentation application. We'll navigate the PowerPoint interface. We'll learn how to design presentations. Big part of PowerPoint is being\nable to insert and format text. We'll also insert and format images. We'll take it a step further. We'll work with objects such as\ntext boxes, shapes, charts, tables. And we'll actually\ninsert and manage tables. Charts. And then we'll take a look at some\nof the animation and transition features just to make your presentation\nmore dynamic and responsive. Go ahead and open up Microsoft\nPowerPoint and we'll dive right in looking to support our\nchannel and get a great deal. Become a member today to unlock\nad free videos that's right, your favorite courses without a single ad. Interested in a specific video purchase\none of our ad free courses individually. Looking for even more? Gain access to exams, certificates, and\nexclusive content at learnitanytime. com. More information can be found\nin the video description below. I'm going to go ahead and open up PowerPoint. Depending on the operating system that\nyou use, just locate your app launcher and go ahead and open up PowerPoint. When you open PowerPoint\nfor the first time, you're presented with the start screen. And on the start screen, we'll Realize\nwe have three big buttons here. One says Home, one says\nNew, and one says Open. And the main thing with these three\nbuttons, they all allow you to pretty much do a couple of different things here. You can find files that you have created. You can open files that you\nhave created or open a template. You can also go ahead and\ncreate a presentation as well. Right now I'm on the Home tab, and the\nHome tab shows me I can see all of my recent presentations that I've created. If I click on the new tab here, this\ngives me the chance to do something like create a new blank presentation. Or, I can go ahead and\nstart from a template. So there's a lot of templates\nhere that are already made for us. This is a really good start if you want\na really good starting point to create a really professional looking document. These were created by professionals. They already have the\nslides inserted for you. You just need to go ahead and\nadd your own content to these different ones here as well. I'll scroll down and we'll just\nquickly take a brief look at one here. So this one is for a sales pitch. So we can see a little preview,\nat least one of the slides. And over here on the right, we get a brief\ndescription of what this actually offers. If I wanted to go ahead and open this\nup, I can go ahead and click on create. I will click on create here\nand I'll take a look at this. So this downloads the file for you. And we can see over\nhere on the sales pitch, Slide pane, we have 21 slides. So this is the first slide. This is the title slide. We can see that we have a\nbackground image in here. We have a few text boxes\nor content placeholders. And let's just preview this. So pretty nice placement of the\ntext and the shapes and the images. So very nice, very organized. Very simple to read. Now, one thing that you'll realize\nis the modern presentations, they resemble web interfaces. So a lot of the shapes and a lot\nof the colors that we'll see, they resemble web pages as well. This one uses a lot of white\nspace, which is perfectly fine. If you can find a good way to balance\nthat, that works well here as well. So basically all of this information\nhere, here is a table, so we can plug our own information in here if we want to. Let's save this to 75, 000. We can go ahead and do that. And then once we're done,\nwe can go ahead and save it. Well, I'm going to go\nahead and run this here. So let's run the presentation. We'll talk about this in just a little\nbit, but down here on the taskbar, we have this little icon here. This will allow us to run the\npresentation or run the slideshow. Here's my slideshow. I can use the arrow keys\nto go to the next slide. I can press back to go to the first slide. I can even press up and down. So whichever way you want to navigate,\nyou can also click on the slide. That brings you from\none slide to the next. Down here on the bottom left, you'd\nsee it's a little faded here, but we have some more controls here. We can go back, we can go forward,\nand we'll cover some of these other advanced features here\nin just a little bit as well. So go ahead and open up\nyour version of PowerPoint. Once you're on the start screen,\njust click on new, and go ahead and search for a presentation. Go ahead and download it. And just preview it and come right back. Now that we've viewed a fully\nfunctional template, let's go ahead and create a new blank presentation. So right here, I'm still\non my start screen. From the home tab, I can go ahead\nand click on blank presentation. I can also get there\nfrom the new tab as well. Let's go ahead and create\na new blank presentation. Here is my blank presentation. Let's take a look at some of\nthe different components here. Here we can see all of our slides. Right now we have one slide. As we add slides we'll\nsee them appear here. We can see that we have our first slide. So this is actually a title slide. It's telling us to add a title and to\ngo ahead and add a subtitle as well. So this slide is a pre made slide. It has its own formatting and its\nown orientation in here as well. If you take a look at the\nbottom, you'll notice that we have, so this is our status bar. Down here we can do things like\nchange the different views. Right now we're using the normal view. If we wanted to take a look at the\nreading view, here's the reading view. If we wanted to run the presentation\nin full screen mode, here is our presentation view here as well. We can also zoom in or out. Notice right now I'm currently at 89%. So depending on your monitor\nsize and or resolution, You may notice a different size here. If I want to go ahead and make this a\nlittle bigger, if I click on the plus sign here, I can see it's making it bigger. If I click on the minus\nsign, it goes back down. But if I wanted to fit perfectly\nbased on my current settings, I'll click on this auto fit here, and\nthis will automatically fit it so I don't have to scroll up or sideways. So I'll click here, fit\nslide to current window. And it's telling me that based on my\ncurrent settings, 89%, I'm good to go. We'll work with these areas\nin just a little bit here. Right now, here's our\nbest friend, the ribbon. This is where we find all of our commands\nthat we can use, such as inserting a new slide, such as changing the font. Once we start entering text, changing\nthe paragraph options here as well. If we click on the Insert tab, we expect\nto find things that we can insert such as a table or pictures or shapes or charts\nor text boxes and various types of media. We're going to be inserting a lot\nof things here into our PowerPoint before this course is over. If we click on the Design\ntab, we'll notice that we have different themes that we can And if you just kind of mouse over\nthem, we can see the preview of what our presentation would look like,\nat least the title slide as well. So that's the ribbon. The other part that we have\nhere is the search box. Now the search box is pretty cool. It does more than just\nallows us to search things. We can get a quick tutorial. We can search for phrases in our document. Let's say I forgot how to zoom. I'll go ahead and type\nthe phrase zoom in here. And this is the way that search box works. It gives us different pieces of\ninformation or opportunities. So the very first tier here, we have\nseveral actions that we can use. So I can use the fit to window command,\nthe same thing that I did down here. I can go ahead and zoom to a particular\nUm, level, and then we have find in slide. So I can go ahead and search for\nthe phrase zoom in my presentation. But then down here is\nwhere it's really cool. We can get help. So maybe I forgot how to zoom in or out\nof a document down here on the bottom. I can get a quick tutorial. So let's go ahead and take a look at that. I'll type zoom in here\nand clear my annotations. I'll click on zoom in\nor out of a document. And just like that, it opens up a\nside pane over here for me, and it gives me a quick one two in terms\nof how to zoom in to my document. Notice it's pointing me to my zoom bar\nhere on my status bar, telling me I can either slide this or I can go ahead\nand click on the minus or click on the plus to zoom in or out here as well. If I want to be more specific, I can\nchoose a particular Zoom setting. So if I click here, this expands\nthe article further for me. So this is good. I don't need to go ahead and search the\ninternet for an answer on how to Zoom. Right here, I can go ahead and,\nand learn right here as well. If I want to expand the article, I can\nclick on this link, and this will open up the article in a browser for me. I'll go ahead and close this here. And we're good to go. So go ahead and navigate the interface. Go ahead and take a\nlook at the search bar. Go ahead and click on the different\nribbon tabs here to see what we can do. See what commands are available. Go ahead and zoom in or\nout of your document. The last thing we can talk about\nhere is, right here we have the ribbon display options. Right now I can see my full ribbon. If I click on this drop down here, I\nhave a couple of different options. I can go to full screen mode. If I want to just see the tabs, So\nI'll just see the tabs, but I don't see any of this information down here. I can show tabs only. So if I click here, so notice I'm only seeing tabs. Now, why would you, why\nwould you want to do this? Well, this gives me a little more room. Now I can see more of my slide. And if you'd notice when I switched to\ntabs only, Now I can utilize more space. I'm at 98 percent as well. If I still need to access a\ncommand, for example, if I wanted to insert something, it does. It's on demand now. So it shows me the full,\nthe root, the ribbon here. And if I click away, it goes back. Now it's your choice. You can either show the tabs or\nonce you click back here again, You'll notice that the ribbon\ndisplay options will appear again. We can also press Ctrl plus F1\nto collapse or expand the ribbon. I'll go back to always show ribbon. And I'm good to go. So go ahead and tour the\ninterface and come right back. Now that we've toured the interface, let's\ngo ahead and focus on our slide here. Let's break this slide down. So as we can see, we\nhave one slide in here. Let's go ahead and add another slide. So this is the title slide. So from the home tab, I can click\non the new slide drop down here. If I click on this arrow, this\nwill show me the different types of slides that I can insert. So if I click here, I can see\nI have a few to choose from. I actually have nine different types\nof slides that I can choose from. So right now, here's our title slide. Here we have title and content. We have a section header. We have two content. Comparison. Title only. So just a title with a blank slide. We have a blank slide. Caption on the left. Content on the right. And we have a picture\nwith caption here as well. I'm going to insert a title and content. And let's go ahead and\ncompare those two slides. So now I have two, because I did insert. So here's my title slide. And then down here, here\nis my title and content. Let's take a look at the title slide here. Now on the title slide, we'll\nnotice that we have two what's called content placeholders. So this is a title content placeholder. And on the bottom, this is a\nsubtitle content placeholder. So they're pre made. They have their own\nspecial formatting in here. So for example, if I were to click inside\nof the title content placeholder, we can see that it's using the font size of 60. Well, let's click on the subtitle content\nplaceholder and let's see what that is. So that is 24. So these are already predefined here. Now, we'll notice once we choose\na design theme, some of these options will change as well. But for now, we have on this slide,\nwe have a title placeholder and we have a subtitle placeholder. Let's take a look at slide number two. So here's slide number two. We can see that we have\na title placeholder. And down here we have what's\ncalled a content placeholder. This is called a content placeholder\nbecause there's various types of content that we can insert. So we can insert a image either\nfrom online or from our device. We can insert icons,\ntables, charts, video. So a lot of different things\nthat we can insert here. We can also add text. So if I just click in here, I have\nnow activated this, this content placeholder and I can type in here. Go ahead and do that. So for this particular content\nplaceholder, the default font size is 28. Let's click on the title here. Now notice the title placeholder for\nthis slide, it's not 60 like the title. This is 44, right? So the title slide is\nmeant to really stand out. So we have bigger and bolder font. But then for each of your slides,\nyou don't want that same size. So this has a size of 44 as well. So, those are the basics\nwhen working with slides. There's different types of\nlayouts that we can use. And then for each slide, each\nslide has its own placeholders. Content placeholder, picture\nplaceholder, different things that we can do here as well. Go ahead and insert a slide,\nand go ahead and take a look at the difference between the two. We can also change the slide. So if I right click on the slide here, I'll go down to layout. Maybe I want to change this\nto content with caption and we can see, so now we\nhave a little more detail. We still have our content placeholder\nover here to the right, but we have a title and text over here as well. Insert a few slides, change the layouts\nand take a look at the placeholders on each slide and come right back. Welcome back. Well, let's go ahead and start\ndesigning our slide here. I'm going to delete the second slide. Now, to delete a slide,\nI can simply click on it. I can see that it's highlighted here,\nand I can either press the delete key or I can right click on it and\nchoose the delete slide command. Either way, I'm going to go\nahead and delete this slide. I'll go ahead and put a title in here. So I'll call this PowerPoint and I'll go ahead and put module one here. Why not? So PowerPoint module one. So we've started. We see we can just simply\nclick on a placeholder and start typing content in there. Now I don't have any colors in here. Everything is just black\nand white, very plain. So the next logical thing\nto do is choose a design. So let's go ahead and\nclick on the design tab. And now we have what's called themes. So we're basically going to go ahead\nand choose a theme, and depending on the theme that you choose,\nyou have what's called variants. So maybe you want a different\nvariation of that particular theme. Maybe that theme is also available\nin blue or purple or orange. We can go ahead and do that. So the first thing I want\nto do is choose a theme. theme. By default, we're using the\nbasic office theme here. Here's the first one, facet. So we can see it adds some, I'll go\nahead and actually click on there. So we can see kind of\nadd some details in here. Let's go ahead and insert a slide as well. So let's go ahead and insert a new slide. Now take a look at the different\nslide layouts that are available. Remember, originally we had nine. Now we have quite a few more here. So each theme will have their own kind\nof special layouts that you can use here. For example, this one has a\nname card that we can use. Let's just add a title and content. And let's go back to the design tab. Let's just continue previewing the\ndifferent designs here that we can use. I'll click on the gallery\ntheme here, and we can see that that's what that looks like. So, here's my title slide, and\nhere's my title and content slide. So, usually spend a little bit of\ntime choosing the theme that is right. Here's another theme. Here's one of my favorite. Here's the Ion boardroom theme. And so I'll go ahead and\nchoose Ion Boardroom. And then I'm going to go ahead and choose\none of these different variants here. So I have four different\nones that I can choose from. Let's see what this would\nlook like with the this color. Here's the bluish color. And also here's the\norange color here as well. So we can use that. Organic is pretty nice as well. But also comes with variants. Go ahead and choose one. Very classy. This one looks very classy. So go ahead and choose one and\njust take a look and see what slide layouts are available. And take a look and see how it's\nactually changing the look and feel of your presentation here. I'm gonna go ahead and choose,\nlet's see where is the Dividend. I like dividend. Can't find it right now. Here it is. I like dividend. If you just hover over it,\nit gives you the name of it. I'll go ahead and use this and I'll\nchange it to this variant here as well. So pretty nice, very modern, very classy. Finally, let's see what displays. Okay. So we just have the basic layouts here. So go ahead and take a look at that. Go ahead and click on the design tab. Choose a theme, choose a variant, and then\ntake a look at the different slide layouts that are available and come right back. Welcome back. Okay, so I have my title slide\nhere, PowerPoint Module 1. I have my title and content here. Let's just go ahead and document\nwhat we've learned so far. So I'll go ahead and put Lesson 1 in here. And Lesson 1 was all\nabout getting started. Now you notice with this particular\ntheme that I selected, It's automatically capitalizing all of the letters that I\ntype here in the, um, in the title area. I'll go ahead and click inside\nof my content placeholder here, and we'll just talk about some\nthings that we learned here. We talked about the start screen,\nwe talked about the ribbon, and I'm just working with a list here. So if I just press enter, we can see\nI'm working with a bulleted list. Most of the content placeholders that we\nwork with, they will incorporate bullets. as well. So start screen ribbon. Uh, we also talked about just\ndifferent, um, slide layouts and we're able to take a look\nat, um, content placeholders. So content placeholders here. That's pretty much what we\ncovered here in lesson one. For lesson two, let's go\nahead and insert a new slide. Let's go ahead and also\ninsert a title and content. So if lesson two we started talking about just\nhow to develop a presentation. So developing a presentation. So one of the first things\nwe need to do is choose a design. Able to choose a design slash theme and optionally choose a variant as well. So that's what we've done so far. Let's continue developing our\npresentation here in lesson two. Now, we're still talking\nabout design here. Now, one of the things that's\navailable is the designer. Now, the designer, it's right here on my\nhome tab, all the way to the far right. We can see I have my designer right here. Now, what the designer is,\nlet's see if we mouse over it. Gives us a little detail. opens the designer pane for\ninstant slide makeovers. So what if you chose a theme,\nbut you're not, you know, you want a little more flexibility. You want a little more\ncontent on your slide. Let's take a look and see based on the\ncontent that we have on this slide. Let's see what the designer\nwill provide for us. So I'll click on the designer here. Now notice when I clicked on the\ndesigner, it's giving me different slides to be able to choose from. So this is using an infographic,\nso it's creating an infographic for me that I can use. The third one here puts\na picture on the left. So the designer basically analyzes the\ncontent that's on your slide, and then it tries to create a slide based on the\ntext that you have on here or pictures. The designer really likes pictures. If I were to add a picture in\nhere, we would see a lot more options that are available. But let's just scroll down here. So basically, if you like one\nof these designs, you can go ahead and just click on it. And that will actually convert your\nslide to that particular design. I'll go ahead and choose this one here. And as you can see, it converted our\ntext into what's called smart art. We'll cover smart art at another\ntime, but it created a nice infographic for us here as well. I can press control Z to undo that. So would you rather have\nyour slide look like this? Would you rather have it look like this? I can always change this if I want to. So if I go back to the top here, let's\nsee this one as a picture on the left. Okay. So that looks pretty nice. Nice little accent color here as well. So you can always change them. But I like these. It's giving us some nice, simple\nlayouts to choose from here as well. Now this is on a per slide basis. This is not going to\nchange every slide for you. If I go back to the title slide\nhere, we'll notice that we have different options that are available. If I want to see more, I can\nclick on see more designs. So that's how the designer works. Sometimes it will not find\na design for you right away. You can always come back a little\nlater and apply a design here as well. I'm going to go ahead\nand choose one of these. I'll choose this one. Nice and elegant. And for my second slide, I'll go ahead\nand convert that to an infographic. So, not so bad. We used the designer. We have three really nice looking slides. We did not have to worry about\nplacing these objects on here and making sure that they align properly. The designer took care of that for us. Everything is lined up. Everything is kind of snapped\nto the grid here as well. So, go ahead and turn on the designer. Go ahead and apply a couple\nof designs to your first three slides and come right back. Welcome back. Well, hopefully you found a\ndesign theme that you'd like. Hopefully you're able to design\neach of your slides individually by using the designer here. So for lesson two, we'll continue\ntalking about developing a presentation. I just added another line here,\ndesigning slides with the designer. So when we're developing a\npresentation, the first step is kind of choosing your design. And after that is adding content. Now, once you add content, The next thing\nthat you may want to do is to either, well, really to work with the text. So here's my text here\non slide number three. Looks a little small. I have a lot of space here at the\ntop and on the bottom, and let's go ahead and take a look and see. I'll go ahead and just\nhighlight the text here. I can double click to highlight a word. I can triple click to\nhighlight an entire row. And once I do that, I can see that\nthis is using the font size of 18. Now, based on the theme that I've\nselected, it uses its own font. As well, right? Because a theme, basically a\ntheme, I'll put the detail here. I'm going to press enter. I'll press tab. So a theme is basically\na set of fonts, colors, and effects. So each theme has its own set\nof fonts, colors, and effects. So that's why we notice that\nthe font type has changed here. Okay, well, let's go ahead and take\na look at a couple of font commands. Maybe I want to change the color here. Maybe I want to change the,\nyou know, change the effect. Maybe make some with the text\nshadow, some bold, italicized. Let's take a look at some of these\ndifferent font commands here. Going to highlight my first row here,\nand I'll go ahead and make that bold. And I can go ahead and\nmake that italicized. I can go ahead and use\nthe text shadow here. So the text shadow kind of gives\nit a nice shadow behind it. I'll go ahead and remove the\nbold and italicize from there. So it's just a subtle way to kind of\ncall attention to something here as well. Uh, what about, let's see,\nwhat else can I do here? Now, here's the strikethrough. So this kind of crosses it out for me. So we're just kind of\nexploring the different font commands that are available. Now, what about, uh,\nhere's the change case. Now this is pretty neat. I can do something like\ncapitalize each word. So notice all of my words are\ncapitalized here, so like a title. So I can do that. I'm going to remove\nthe strikethrough here. I'll remove the text shadow. If I want to make it all uppercase,\nI can go ahead and do that. But I think I'm good. I'm just going to leave it as\nsentence casing here as well. Now I do want to make\neverything a little bigger. Right now it's 18. So I want to increase the size. So I'm going to highlight\nall of the content in here. And what I'll do is I'll\nclick on the big A here. And this will make my text\njust a little bit bigger. And maybe about there. I just want to make sure\nit's not as big as my title. So my title is 28. And now I'm at 24. So that looks pretty good. I can go ahead and do that. Now this is a level two item here\nbecause I have a, I indented this so it's, so by default it's smaller\nthan the level one item here as well. So I'll go ahead and make this italicized. If you like shortcuts, as you hover over\nthese different commands, if a shortcut is available, it will be displayed for you. So if I wanted to make this\ntext bold, I can press ctrl b, ctrl i will italicize it for me. Control U will place the\nunderline there as well, so we can use those font commands. I'm going to go ahead and make\nthat italicized, and maybe I'll make that all uppercase as well. I'll also change the color. Now when you're changing colors in\nPowerPoint, You'll notice that you have what's called theme colors. So again, remember a theme is a\nset of colors, fonts, and effects. So these are the different colors\nthat come with this particular theme, this dividend theme that I chose here. We have different varieties of that\ncolor, and we always have these standard colors down here as well. Now, you want to kind of stay\naway from the standard colors. Because the professional that created this\ntheme, these colors work together well. So if I choose any of these colors,\nit's not going to adversely affect the look and feel of my text there. But if I were to choose a standard\ncolor, I can kind of see it's not really a nice contrast right away. Not all of them, just\nsome of them here as well. So maybe I want to change this. Not a lot of color options available here. A lot of kind of, you know, dull colors. But there you go. So I can go ahead and\nchange that if I want to. We also have the highlighter. So if you wanted to highlight something,\nyou can use the highlighter here. Not a big fan of it though. I typically don't use that. So we can do that as well. So, we can change the font size,\nwe can apply these different font commands here as well. I can also go ahead and maybe, you\nknow, change the, change my bullets. So right now, because of this particular\ntheme, I have these square bullets. If I click on the bullets drop down here,\nI can change that to maybe arrows, or star bullets, or hollow square bullets. I'll use hollow square and I'm good to go. I'm going to go ahead and remove this\nhighlighting here so I can say no color. Another really nice tool that I\nlike to use in the font command group is this little eraser here. Now what this does, this will\nallow us to remove the formatting from any chunk of text. So if I wanted to reset\nthis here back to the text. I can go ahead and click here. Notice how it puts it back\nto normal for me, with the exception of the sentence casing. So I can go ahead and do that as well. So go ahead and insert some text. Go ahead and take a look at the\ndifferent font commands that are available and come right back. Welcome back. So that wraps up lesson two. So we're able to choose a design\nOr, we're able to design slides with the designer, and we're able\nto add some content here as well. Let's go ahead and insert a new slide. There's several ways that we can do this. Let's go ahead and turn\non our notes actually. This way we can kind of document\nany kind of tips and tricks that we're learning here as well. So I'll click on notes here. This opens up my notes pane, and\nI can go ahead and type in here. So, a, a shortcut for us, if we\nwant to insert a slide, we can press control plus M, as in Mary,\nthat will insert a slide for us. Or, if I click on that third slide here\nand just press the enter key, it basically inserts the same type of slide for me. So I have the title and\ncontent here as well. If I press control Z to undo that, the\nother way is I can click on the new slide dropdown here like we did before,\nand I can go ahead and choose another type, but if I just want the title and\ncontent, I can just press control M, or I can just press the enter key as\nlong as I have the slide selected here. I'm just going to press enter\nhere, and here is my slide. Let's put the lesson three in here, and lesson three is all about formatting content. Now when it comes to content,\nwe'll talk about just a few here. So we're able to, um, we're\nable to format some text. We're going to, um, format our\nplaceholder, and then we'll go ahead and format a text box as well. So when it comes to formatting text,\none of the things that we can do, we can always highlight the text and we can apply\none of these font commands if we want to. But let's go ahead and use the shape\nformat tab to format all the text that's inside of our placeholder here. Now if you notice I'm clicked inside\nof my placeholder and take a look at the border we can see that we\nhave a dashed line or a dotted line. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the border here. Once I click on the border, I\nnotice that I have a solid line. Now when you do that, that's the\nsame thing as selecting all of the text inside of the placeholder here. So I clicked on the border, I have\na solid line, and now I can do something like change the font color\nfor all of my content that's in there. I can make everything bold if I want to. So that's one thing that we can do. I'm going to put this back to black here. Now, I want to introduce you to\nwhat's called a contextual tab. I'll put this up here. So the contextual tab is the key\nto formatting different objects. So I'll put that in the notes here. Format objects. Objects are things like\ntext boxes, charts, tables, and so forth and so on. Images, icons, shapes. So notice, When I click inside of\nmy placeholder here, if you take a look at the end of my ribbon, I\nhave what's called shape format. So this is contextual or on demand. It only appears when I'm\ninteracting with an object. So if I click on the blank area on\nmy canvas here, notice it goes away. It's no longer there. But if I click inside of my title\nplaceholder, I get shape format. If I click here inside of my. content placeholder, I get shape format. Let's click on that and\nlet's see what we can do. So what I can do is I have a, well,\nlet's take a look at WordArt first. So I'll click on shape format. I want to make sure I clicked on\nthe border here and here's just some different WordArt that we can use. WordArt, they come with a lot of\ndifferent types of formatting. So this one has a black with a shadow. So here's the second one. Blue, gray, accent color one, shadow. So some of these are very\nsubtle or very intense. So it's a quick way to just kind of\ncall attention to your content by using one of these word art styles. Some are very simple. Some are very, very complex. You can click here. We can see all the word art\nstyles that are available. I'll go with the basic shadow. Almost like our Actually it did, it\ndid apply the text shadow for us. So it's the same command. Let's go ahead and format\nthis content placeholder. I'm going to resize it. So I'll click here. I'm just going to drag it over to about there. Don't need for it to be that big. And I'll click on shape format. Now, once we click on the shape format,\nthis is the key to formatting content. Once we click on here, we can do\nthings like give it a shape style. Or we can give it a shape effect. We can resize it using the resizing tool. We can even align it here as well. Let's just take a look at some\nshape styles that are available. What if I wanted to put a background color\njust inside of my content placeholder? Not the entire slide. What if I wanted some effects? Nice border around here as well. Well, that's what a shape style is. If you click on shape style, here are\nthe different styles that are available. Very simple. Then it gets a little more\ncomplex as we go down the list. So we can see this, this first row\nhere, it's just an outline color, just different theme color outlines. If I click on the more options\nhere, here are all of the shape styles that are available. So that second row combines a\nfill color with a border color. So I can use that. If we go down the list,\nwe have different effects. So we have some gradient effect,\nkind of like a two tone look. We have shadows. Now we have shadow with a glow as well. So the bottom line is you don't\nhave to just settle for the default layout of your content placeholders. You can give it a quick\nstyle if you want to. I'm just going to go ahead\nand give this a basic one. So I'll just give it a Basic style here. And let's take a look at shape effects. Different presets. So here's a preset one. So it gives it that nice\nkind of white border. Looks a little three dimensional. And so just go ahead and check them out. Different presets. Right. There's a basic one in the\nshadow on the bottom right. So, we have, we have shadows that\nwe can use, some basic shadows or some more complex shadows. We have reflections, some are subtle, some are intense. We have glows, so we can give it\nan outside glow if we want to. We have soft edges and\nwe have bevels as well. I'll just give it a I'll\nleave mine as is here as well. All right. Then, of course, we can go ahead\nand resize this if we want to. Make it higher or wider. We can go ahead and do that as well. So go ahead and add some content\nto your content placeholder. Click on the shape format tab. Toggle some of the different shape styles. some of the different effects. Check out WordArt as\nwell and come right back. Let's continue lesson three. So we took a look at the contextual\ntab, in this case the shape format. We're able to insert some text. We formatted the text using the\ncouple of the WordArt styles here. And we're able to format the\nplaceholder by either choosing a shape effect or a shape style. Also being able to resize it here as well. Let's go ahead and insert an object. Let's insert a text box. Let's click on the insert tab. And from the insert tab, let's\ngo ahead and insert a text box from the text command group. So this is an object that\nwe're actually adding here. So we can draw a text box anywhere. And text boxes are great because we\ncan resize them, we can add a style to them, we can add text to it. I'll go ahead and click here. Now we have to draw it. So here's my little drawing tool. So I'm just going to draw it. You can make it as big as you want to. You can always resize it a little later. I'm just going to go to about\nhere, make it about that big. So as soon as I enter my text box here,\nI'm going to go ahead and add some content in there, and then I'll take a look at\nthe shape format to see what's available. Now, these two are identical, so my\ntext box and my content placeholder, you'll notice a lot of the same tools\nare available once we start interacting with our text box here as well. Actually, before I start adding text,\nI'll click on the shape format tab. I'll go ahead and give\nthis a quick A quick style. We'll go ahead and we'll\ngo with this orange here. I'm actually going to go ahead\nand change my variant here. So I'll click on the design tab\nand I'll go for a more blue. color here just for purposes\nof this demonstration. So I'll just change my variant to blue. Again, you can always change at\nany point in your presentation before you deliver it. So I'll go ahead and add some\ncontent here for my text box. So, so I'll say use the contextual tab to format objects. Text boxes. I'll just say text boxes gives more. So there we go. So here's my text box. So I can move it. So what if I wanted to go ahead and\nmove this text box somewhere else? What I can do is click on the border. So take a look at my cursor. It's that diagonal arrow. If I move my cursor inside\nof the text box, I have my basically typing cursor here. If I move my cursor to the, to\nthe border or the outside, it changes to this four way crosshair. Now that lets me know I can grab it. So now I can go ahead and move it. So I click and drag and I can move it. to anywhere I want to on the slide. So maybe I want to place it\ndown here towards the bottom. I can go ahead and do that. But let's get a little help here. Maybe I want to go ahead\nand snap it exactly to the bottom right of my slide here. So I'll click on shape format and\nover here in the arrange command group, I'll choose the alignment here. So I'll click on align So first, I want\nto align it to the bottom of the slide. Notice how it snaps it to the\nbottom of the slide for me. Next, I want to go ahead\nand align it to the right. So, there you go. I can snap it right to the\nbottom right if I want to. If I click back on here, I decide\nlater I want to align it to the middle. I can go ahead and do that. I can align center. There we go. All right, or I can just go ahead\nand drag it down here as well. I'm gonna align it to the bottom\nright, so bottom, and then align it to the right, and there we go. So those are text boxes. If you want to, we can actually\ncopy and paste this text box. If I right click on it, I can copy it,\nand I can paste, and this allows me to have the exact replica here as well. And there we go. So those are text boxes. I'm going to go ahead and\nmove this back up here. And there we go. So go ahead and insert a few text\nboxes, add some content in there, click on the shape format tab, and\ngo ahead and give it a quick style. Come right back. Welcome back. So that concludes lesson\nthree, formatting content. As we continue with our course, we'll\nbe spending a lot of time working with the contextual tabs that appears\nwhen we insert different objects. Let's go ahead and insert\nanother slide for lesson four. And this time we want a two content slide. Let's go ahead and insert that. Here are two content placeholders, one on the left, one on the right. So let's go ahead and\nput in lesson four here. Lesson four is all about graphical elements. So when we talk about graphical\nelements, we talk about pictures, we talk about icons, and so forth and so on. So let's go ahead and insert an image. Now, several ways we can insert an image. Right here in the content placeholder,\nwe can see that we have two options here to insert an image. We can also click on the insert tab. So if we click on the insert\ntab, we can insert pictures. We'll get a list of different\ntypes of pictures that we can add. We can also do it right here\nfrom the content placeholder. The first one here is stock images. The second one is pictures. So, if I click here, it opens up\nthe folder structure on my computer. Let's click on stock images. So, these are the Microsoft\nstock images that we can reuse. Now, when we get here, here's\nthe stock images dialog. There's different things\nthat we can search for. So, by default, we're looking for images. But we can also search for icons. We have cutout people, stickers, videos,\nillustration, and cartoon people. So there's a lot of different\ncontent that we can add here as well. So if you click on icons, let's\njust quickly preview them. Icons are pretty cool. There's pretty much an icon for\neverything that you want to express. And they always come in the same size. They're always one, one by one. We have cutout people. So we have Carrie, we have Stanley,\nLance, so forth and so on, and they have different expressions that we can\nuse to drive a point home in our slide. And of course we have stickers. Everyone loves stickers. We have short videos. These are about 10\nseconds or so, maybe 12. We have illustrations that we can use, kind of like\nicons, but they have a little more color, a little more detail. And then we have cartoon people\nthat we can use here as well. But let's go ahead and insert an image. We want to insert an image that\nwe want to go ahead and edit that actual image or format that image. using the contextual tab that will\nappear after we insert our image. So I'll go ahead and\nsearch for an image here. I'll look for something\nrelated to learning. You can look for any picture you want. Let's see. I'll scroll down here, look for something. Let's change that. Maybe I'll look for something with a team. I'll go ahead and grab this one here. Nice colors in there. I'll go ahead and insert that picture. So it inserts that picture for\nus right inside of that content placeholder, which is very, very nice. If I were to insert this picture,\nsometimes what happens is the picture appears so big that it's\nkind of like going off of your slide. In that case, we would need to click on\nthe format, but let's keep it simple. Let's go ahead. This is a very nice picture. Let's go ahead and click\non the picture format. And, the first thing we'll notice\nis that we have different picture styles that we can choose from. On the far left, we have some\nadjustments that we can make, as well. Some corrections, recolor. Let's preview them, and\nlet's see what we can do. We want to get to picture styles\neventually, but let's go ahead and take a look and see what's available here. So, here's some different corrections, so\nI can either sharpen or soften the picture If I want to, take a look at my picture as\nI'm hovering over these different options. So I can brighten the picture,\njust some simple edits that we can do to this particular picture. Here is color. So I can recolor it, the saturation, really saturated here, 400%,\nI can change the color tone. Temperature change. And then I can recolor it if I want to. So lots of pretty cool\nthings that we can do. We have different artistic effects. So if I wanted to make this look more\nlike a marker, or a pencil grayscale, or a pencil sketch, I can go ahead and do that. So some pretty nice ones here as well. There's glass. Glassy look. So, pretty, pretty nice. We have transparency and then we'll head\non over here to different picture styles. I always use picture styles when\nI insert a picture, you don't want it to appear flat on our canvas. You want it to stand out. So click on that picture format\nand let's take a look at these different styles that we can use. So here's a simple frame white, just\nputs a nice white frame on the outside. And go ahead and preview those. So here's a metal frame. That looks pretty cool. Here's a basic shadow. Here's one of my favorites. Reflected rounded rectangle. If we click here on the all,\nwe can see all of the picture styles that are available. And here's my favorite. This bevel rectangle. Nice, modern, modern. Look and feel here as well. I'll go ahead and choose one more. My other one that I like is this one. It's a reflected bevel black. So pretty, pretty nice. Just like with our shape format,\nwe have picture effects as well. Different presets that we can use. We can come sometimes combine\nthem with a picture style. Sometimes they overwrite each other. So typically you're either choosing a\npicture style or you're creating your own picture effect by choosing a shadow,\nreflection, glow, and so forth and so on. So go ahead and insert a picture. Go ahead and click on\nthe picture format tab. Take a look at some of the adjustments\nand go ahead and choose a picture style. Come right back. We'll take a look at a few more tools. Welcome back. Hopefully you had fun taking a look\nat those picture format styles here. Let's take a look at a few more tools. Let's go ahead and take a look at\nthe cropping tool for our picture, and then we'll take a look at the\nbackground removal tool here as well. So I'll go ahead and maybe\nI want to crop this picture. So maybe I want to remove some\nof the space here at the top. Maybe I want to just kind of remove it. from here as well. So I can do that. I'll go ahead and click on my picture\nand I'll click on the picture format contextual tab and the size command group. I'll go ahead and click\non the cropping tool here. So once I click here,\nI am in cropping mode. So here are my different\ncropping handles that I can use. So what I'll do, I'll go ahead\nand move everything up here. I want to come to about Here. And I'll come down just a\nlittle bit from the top. Coming from the sides as well. So there's my new picture. That's what the new\npicture would look like. Now, What I can do is just click away\nfrom the picture, and as you can see, I just cropped the picture from the bottom,\nthe sides, and the top here as well. So that's the cropping\ntool that we can use. Now if you made a big mess of\nyour picture, what we can always do is we can reset the picture. We can reset the picture based on\nthe formatting that we chose, or the formatting and the original size. So if I want to reset everything\nhere, I'll click on Reset Picture. If I click on Reset Picture, it basically\nremoves the formatting, so the styles and the effects here, but it's still cropped. If I click on Reset Picture and Size, it\nputs my picture back to the original size. So here's one of the problems that\nwe face when we insert pictures. It's really big, we can't see it. No need to panic. What we're going to do is locate the\npicture format tab and we're going to resize it using the width here. So if I go here, I'll just click on that\ndown arrow until it comes back into focus. I can actually see it on my slide. Notice as I'm using this tool, it's\nbasically maintaining the aspect ratio. So it's not distorting my picture. It's not making it flat\nor so forth and so on. So I'll just go ahead and do that\nuntil I get it to the size that I like. I can also resize the picture by\nusing one of these corner handles. If I use the corner handles to resize the\npicture, it does not distort the picture. If I use this top or bottom or left\nor right, it This will distort the picture, so I don't want to use those. I'm going to use one of these to\nmake it a little bigger and still maintain the aspect ratio here as well. So that's how you reset the picture. Let's go ahead and insert\nanother picture here. And let's take a look at\nthe background removal tool. Let's see if I can find\nmy buddy the eagle here. So I want a picture of this eagle. But let's see, maybe I'll grab this one. I want to remove the background from it. I'll go ahead and insert that\ninto my content placeholder and going to make it a little bigger\nso I can see a little better here. So again, I'll use the corner resize,\nnot one of the side ones here. Notice how it flattens the picture. So I'll use one of the Corners here. And Let's see. I'll put it over this one for\nnow so it doesn't get in the way. So really nice picture, but I want to\ngo ahead and remove the background. I just want to kind of cut out\nmy ego from this picture here. So we do have a remove background tool. I'll click on shape format and\nhere is my move background. Once I click on here, it's going to put\nme into the remove background editor. It's a simple editor. If I click here, it gives me a\ncouple of different options here. Now take a look at what\nactually did a pretty good job. It actually removed most\nof the background for me. So it automatically tries\nto remove the background. This one is very, very good. I actually don't really\nneed to do anything here. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on keep changes. And look at that. So it removed the background\ncompletely for me. And now I can go ahead and crop this. I don't need all that white space here. Get rid of all that white space. So this worked a lot better\nthan I expected it to. Sometimes you just need to\nkind of interact with it. But let me go ahead\nand insert another one. I'll insert my other eagle. So stock image. And I'll grab this one here. And just make it a little smaller. Okay, so that's fine. I'm going to delete this other one. I'll just press click on it\nand press the delete key. And I'll delete this\ncontent placeholder as well. Okay, so here's my eagle. Let's take a look at the\nbackground removal tool. Okay, so this one did a pretty good\njob, but you can see it's still trying to remove parts of the head here. So at this point, what I need to do\nis, I need, I need, I have two options. I can choose to mark the areas I want to\nkeep or mark the areas I want to remove. It's removed most of it, so I want to keep the head here. And that did pretty good. And I want to keep the talons. So here are the talons down here. I want to remove the background\nfrom between the talons here. So I'm just kind of pointing to where\nI want to keep, where I want to remove. And there you go. That looks pretty good. I think I'm good to go. So I'll click on keep changes. I can also discard all changes if\nI just don't like the way it looks. I'll keep my changes. Here's my eagle. I'm going to go ahead and resize it. And here we go. So that is the background removal tool. All right, so pretty, pretty nice. Now remember, you can always upload\npictures into, so if you have a picture on your computer, you can\nupload it right here into PowerPoint. Take advantage of these simple\nediting options here as well. Let's finish up lesson four by\ntaking a look at the eyedropper. Now, Eyedropper is a really nice tool. In this case, what I want to do, I'm going\nto delete the picture of my eagle here. I can actually right click and save this\nas a picture to my computer if I want to. This will save all those\nformatting that I used here. I'm going to go ahead and\npress delete just to remove it. And I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert just a few text boxes here. I'll insert about four. And I'll just call this one. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert another text box. And this is going to be, I'll\nbe specific, this is color two. This is color one. And I'll insert two more. This is color three. And I'll do one more. I could duplicate the text box. I could copy and paste it as\nwell, but I'll keep it simple. We'll talk about that\nin another lesson here. So here I have four colors. So what I want to do is I want to\ngo ahead and I like this picture. So I want to go ahead and pick up\nsome of the colors from this picture. So maybe from the shirt, I\nwant to go ahead and apply that color to this text box here. Maybe this color to that text box. Right, and so forth and so on. So if I wanted to recolor this text\nbox here, if I click on it and click on shape format, here is the text fill. So I can choose a fill color, so\nremember, I can choose a style that will recolor it for me. But what if I'm not finding\nthe color that I want? And if I click on, I'm sorry,\nshape fill, not text fill. So if I click on shape fill here. I'm pretty much limited to the colors\nbased on the theme that I have selected here or some of the standard colors. But as you can see, I\ncan't find this color here. So what I can do is click on more fill\ncolors and now it's really advanced. I get this kind of color palette\nhere I have to choose from. I can also click on custom and put in\nthe RGB value if I knew what it was. I do not know what the RGB\nvalue is of this color. So, I'm going to go ahead and hit\ncancel, but wait a minute, what I can do is I can use the eyedropper. I'll click on the shape fill again, and\nif you take a look, right underneath more fill colors, here's the eyedropper. Pick a fill color by clicking\nwithin the app window to pick a color outside of the app window. Click and drag. Okay, let's go ahead and\nturn on the eyedropper here. So here's my little eyedropper. And basically what I do when I\nmove over a color, if I just pause, it tells me what that color is. So this is light gray and\nthere's the RGB value. Well, I want this color for this shirt. So that's plum RGB value 882739. Let's see what happens if\nI click on that color here. Look at that. It actually found that color and\napplied that color to my text box here. Well, let's try that again. Let's click on this text box here. I'll click on shape\nformat for the shape fill. I'll grab the eyedropper and\nthis time I want this color. Let's see what color this is. So that is dark green. So if I click on here, it's\ngoing to apply that color. So it's basically replicating that color\nfor me from from one object to another. Huh, well let's see what else\nI can do with eyedropper. What if I wanted to grab something else,\nlike the color that's off of my slide. Maybe a color from another slide. Or maybe a color from my ribbon,\nlike this PowerPoint color here. Well, I can do that as well. It's a little tricky. Well, let's see. I want to grab this\nPowerPoint color up here. So, I'll click on shape format. I'll click on shape fill. This is pretty close to it, but not\nreally the color I'm looking for. So, I'll click on the eyedropper here. Now, once I move off the slide,\nNotice my eyedropper disappears. So, I want to get this color,\nbut my eyedropper disappeared. If you want to grab a color off\nof the slide, you need to, while you're still on the slide, hold down\nthe left mouse button and drag it. I'm still holding down\nthe left mouse button. So now I can go ahead and pull\nin the color from anywhere on my screen, either on PowerPoint,\nanother window that I have open. I can pull in color from anywhere. I'll go ahead and pull in this color. It's telling me it's red. And there we go. I'll go ahead and pull in the\ncolor from this slide here as well. We do have this color available, but\njust to demonstrate how we can do that, I'll grab my eyedropper again. So really, really cool tool. Again, I'll hold down\nthe left mouse button. Now I can drag and pull in any color. So that's turquoise. And let's see what else is in here. I'll go ahead and pull that in. So that is the eyedropper. So that's how we can use the\neyedropper to pull in colors from one object to the next here as well. So really, really nice tool, especially\nwhen you start to use PowerPoint often and you're customizing your designs. This is a really, really\nnice tool to be able to use. So go ahead and insert a few text boxes. Go ahead and add some text in there. And Use the eyedropper to take\ncolors from your picture and add them to your text box. Welcome back. So that covers our first four\nlessons completing module one. Now let's go ahead and save our\nwork and run our presentation. So a couple of different things\nthat we can do to save, we can press control plus S we can press F 12 or\nwe can press file and save as well. If I press control S\nbecause I'm logged into my. Outlook account. It's asking me to just\nsave it to my OneDrive. I can give it a name and I can press save. If I press the F12 key on\nmy keyboard, it pulls up the folder structure on my computer. Now I can save it to my\ndesktop or my documents. I'll save it to my desktop. I'll just call this PowerPoint module one and I'll press save. There you go. I'm good to go and I am saved. So let's go back. I'll click on the first slide here. And let's go ahead and run\nthis in presentation mode. Here are the different views. Here's normal view. Here's the slide sorter view. So again, the slide sorter\nview allows me to kind of move things around in a simple way. I want to do that. This is helpful if you\nhave a lot of slides. The next one here is the reading view. So, this will run my presentation for me. I'm going to go back to\nthe first slide here. So, here's lesson one. We talked about the start screen,\nthe ribbon, slide layouts, and content placeholders. Lesson two, we talked about\ndeveloping a presentation. In lesson three, we're able to\nformat content, specifically using the contextual tab. And then we're able to integrate images\nand formatting into our presentation. I'm going to run this in slideshow. I can also press F5 to run the slideshow. So here's my first slide. My title is missing. I need to fix that. If I go to the next slide. Now I'm presenting in full screen mode. I can press escape to end the\npresentation, or if I just keep going, it does that for me. End of the slideshow, click\nto exit, and I'm good to go. I'll go back to the normal view. And here we are. So we're saved. We're able to run the presentation. Not sure what happened to my title here. Oh, here it is. So it's hiding. Another lesson we'll take a look\nat how we can format objects when they don't behave just like this. There we go. All right. Very good. So congrats on completing module one. Let's go ahead. I'll share a file from module two\nand we'll work on that file together. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and dive into Module 2. I do have my practice file open\nhere for PowerPoint Module 2. Please make sure that you have that open. We have five slides here. Here's the title slide. And we have our four lessons. So Lesson 5 is about managing objects. I already have some content\non this slide for us. We'll take a look at different\nways that we can manage them. Lesson 6 is all about adding tables. We'll go ahead and insert a table or two. Lesson four, adding and managing charts. So we'll go ahead and add a\nchart and manage the data there as well, customize the chart. For lesson number eight, we'll take\na look at what we can do to prepare before we deliver a presentation. I'll go ahead and turn the notes on. So every slide will have a set of\nnotes, kind of different tasks that we'll be performing on those as well. Thank you. So I'll go back here to\nlesson number five, slide two. Actually, I'll go back to the,\nto the first slide and I'm gonna go ahead and choose a design. So feel free to choose a design right now. It's just very plain. So I'll go ahead and\nchoose a quick design here. I'll keep it simple. I'll either go for wood type and\nlet's see what that looks like. So, pretty simple, doesn't\nadd a lot of visuals. I'll stick to wood type, and then\nwe'll go ahead and jump into Lesson 5. So, go ahead and open up this\npractice file, come right back, we'll dive into Lesson 5. Welcome back. So, let's go ahead and jump into Lesson 5. So, what we want to do is just\nkind of overcome some of the issues that we will face when we have\nmultiple objects on a slide here. So we can see that we have a shape,\nwe have a text box, we also have three images here that we can work with. Well, we want to go ahead and\ncreate maybe our one year goals. You can use any scenario you'd like here. I'm going to go ahead\nand click on slide three. We want to convert this\nslide to look like this. So this slide is well balanced. We can see everything is pretty\naligned pretty nicely here. Everything is kind of on the same line. We can see that our picture is\ncenter aligned on the text box. Our shape is center aligned on the\ntext box and the picture as well. So let's go ahead and take a\nlook and see how we can do this. Let's go ahead and click\non slide number two. So, we'll be talking about grouping. We'll be discussing\naligning objects as well. So the first thing I want to do,\nI need to determine, well, how, what kind of layout do I want? How do I want to change this here? I'm going to go ahead and\nchange my title first. I'll call this my one year goals. I'll center align that and\nI'll move it up a little bit. But don't need for it to be. Take up that much space. And I'll go ahead and\naccept the correction here. So one year goals. And so what I want to do, I'm going to\ngo ahead and move these things around. So if you click on these different\nobjects, if you click on an image, you can click anywhere on the image and\nyou can pretty much move it around. So we can do that. With the shape, same thing. You click anywhere on a\nshape, you can move it around. Text boxes are a little different. Here. Now, if I click inside of a\ntext box, I can't move it. If I want to move a text box, I need\nto click on the border when I see that four way cross here and now I\ncan go ahead and move it as well. Okay, just for now, I'm just going\nto go ahead and move my pictures over here to the right and let's\nactually take care of that first. Let's go ahead and group these\npictures together and let's try and make them the same size. To group an object together,\nwhat we're going to do, we're going to use the CTRL command. So if you hold down the CTRL key,\nso I'll click on my picture here. I'm going to hold down the CTRL\nkey and click on this picture. I'll hold down the CTRL key again\nand I'll click on the third picture. So that is how you create a group. You can pretty much group anything. If I wanted to group my\nshape with this as well. I can go ahead and do that as well. I can also group my text box. But for now, let's understand\nhow grouping works. So right now I have these grouped. So what I can do now is I can\nuse my arrow keys and I can move these together like a group. So I can go to the right,\nI can go up, I can go down. I can do something like, if I click on\nthe picture format here, if I wanted to give all of them the same style. I can do that. So I can put all of them\ninside of a metal frame. I'm going to go ahead and choose a style. I'll choose the rounded diagonal corner. And then I'll go ahead\nand resize all of them. So I'll click on my bigger picture\nhere and I'll go ahead and just kind of resize all of them at the same time here. Great. So that's grouping. I can resize them together. Or, I can go ahead and move them\ntogether, or I can go ahead and apply the same type of style, or the\nsame type of picture effect, or some different adjustments here as well. Really, I can only recolor them. To break away from the grouping, just\nclick on a blank area, and now they're on groups, and I can move them freely. But I want them to all be the same size. So, I'll go ahead and check the size. I'm going to move my first picture\nover here, underneath my text box. Just want to make sure it's\nkind of the same width. So, I'm just going to\nresize it, to what I like. Now what I'm looking for, when\nyou're moving objects around, you'll get some temporary guidelines. As you can see, take a look at my picture. I have these, these four arrows here. I want to make sure it's the\nsame width as my text box above. So I'm just going to go ahead and\nresize it until I see that vertical dashed line on the left and the\nvertical dashed line here on the right. So those temporary lines, they\nlet me know that my picture is the same width as my text box. So that looks good. So what is the width of\nthis current picture? Because I want my other\npictures to have the same width. So if I take a look over here on the\npicture format, I can see that it is 1. 9 by 2. 97. So I want to make sure\nthat these are the same. So I'll click on my other\npicture, and I'll make this 1. 9, let's see, 1. 97, 2. 97. So 1. 97 and 2. 96, that's okay. I'll make this also 1. 9, 1. 97. Okay, so now they're all the same size. They all have to have the same\npicture style here as well. So that is how we group objects,\nand that's the benefit of grouping objects together. We'll see a little later, once\nwe have them grouped, we can also animate them together as well. Go ahead and group your pictures together. Apply a picture style. Go ahead and resize them so that they're\nall the same size and come right back. Now that I have all three of my\npictures, uh, as the same size, I'll go ahead and set this up here. So the first thing I want to do,\nthe next thing we'll talk about is arranging and aligning objects. We'll already see that when we're\nmoving an object on the canvas, we get all these little temporary lines here. Now look what happens if I move\nmy image right in the middle. of the slide. I get the vertical bar there\nand the horizontal bar. So that lets me know that I'm dead\ncenter or exactly in the middle of this slide, both vertically and horizontally. If I move to the right or to the left, there's that vertical line. Let's me know I'm aligned right there. If I go up or down, I can see that horizontal\nline there as well. So, also when you move an object, it\ngives you, it lets you know how you are aligned in relation to another object. So right now, I can see that I'm on the\nsame plane as my picture on the left. If I go up, it's showing me I'm aligned\nto my text box, to the middle of the text box, to the bottom of the text box. And right now, I'm\naligned to that picture. Right there as well. So look out for those temporary lines. We can also turn on the grid\nlines or the guidelines. If I click on the view tab here, I can go ahead and turn on, I can\neven turn on the ruler if I want to. I can turn on all three of these options. Let's see what I get. So here's the ruler. So as I kind of move, we can see\nwhere I am in relation to the ruler, both vertically and horizontally. Here are the grid lines. So Gridline is a really nice\nway to show where one object is in comparison to another. And then we have the guides. And so the guides gives\nus the vertical guide here and the horizontal guide. So lots of different things. I'll go ahead and turn off the grid lines. I just want the guides\nand the ruler for now. So, when we're arranging and\naligning objects, we need to first decide what we want to do. So, remember, we want\na horizontal alignment. So, three columns here as well. So, the first thing I need to\ndo is position my first object exactly where I want it to be. Everything else will be aligned\nbased on that first one here as well. So, I'll take my first text box here. I just want to align it to the left. Margin here. Let me move my shape out of the way. I just want to focus on this\nwhen I keep going to the left. Until I want to make sure I'm\nlined up with my text box here. My title box rather. So I'll move it to the left. Right there. So that's as far as I\nwant to go on the left. And I'll come down a little\nbit maybe to about here. My first object is in place. Everything else will be\nbased on that object. Now my picture, I'll go\nahead and align this. I can see it's aligned. I'll just move it down just a little bit. It's aligned with my text box here. And now here is my, I want to make sure that my\nlittle shape here with the number one is aligned, center aligned\non my picture and my text box. So there we go. The first three objects are aligned. And now I want to go ahead and add\nanother text box, two more text boxes and align these pictures as well. So what I can do, I can duplicate\nthis text box if I want to. So to duplicate an object,\nI'll press control D. So I'll click on my text box here. I want to make sure I'm clicking\non the border and not inside. Okay, so I'll click on the border. I see the solid line, and\nnow I can press control D, basically duplicates that for me. So any style, anything I had in\nthere would have been the same. Now I'll use those temporary\nguides to make sure I'm aligned horizontally with my first text box. And then I'm aligned with my\npicture on the bottom here as well. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthat one more time. So I'll press control D. And sometimes when you duplicate it\nagain, it kind of distributes it evenly, so it's the same space between the\nfirst one here, which is pretty good. So at this point, I'll go ahead and\nmake sure everything else is aligned. I'll go ahead and align my picture here. Make sure everything is okay. I'm gonna make sure my\npictures are the same height. I need to move this one\nup a little bit here. And there we go. So our three text boxes and\nour three pictures are aligned. Now I can duplicate my, my shape here. So I'll press control D and\nI'll press control D again. And so here are my shapes. I'll go ahead and make sure this\none is center aligned on my picture. And I'll move this one here. Make sure this is centered\naligned on this picture as well. And I'll go ahead and make\nthese a little bigger. So I'll group my shapes,\nhold down the CTRL key. Now when you're grouping shapes,\nI want to make sure I click on the border of the shape. If I try to click on the\ninside, it doesn't work. I want to click on the border. Hold down the CTRL key. I'm just going to resize these,\nmake them a little bigger. Make them as big as I\nwant to, maybe about, not that big. Now I can kind of move them. I want to center all of them. on each picture. I'll go ahead and change\nthis to, to number two. So this is goal number two. This is goal number three. I'm good to go. I'll turn on the, I'll\nturn off the guides. I'll turn on the grid lines. Just make sure that I'm\ncentered here on each of them. That's centered. That's centered. And that's centered. Make sure they're all in\nthe same horizontal plane. That looks pretty good. So I'm good to go. I pretty much have everything arranged\nexactly the way that I want it to be. So I'm good to go. What we can do now is if we want to\ngo ahead and add a style to these text boxes, we can go ahead and do that. So if you want to grab a quick shape,\nshape format, give those a particular style, you can go ahead and do that. And go ahead and add a style to\neach of your shapes here as well. And come right back. Welcome back. Okay. I'm going to turn off my grid lines here. So I'll click on the View tab. I'll uncheck the grid lines. I'll also turn off the ruler. Don't really need that right now. Now let's put it all together. Let's go ahead and animate. some of these different objects here. So this slide clearly\nstates our one year goals. We can see our first goal is\nhere, enrolled in martial arts. Oh, I need to go ahead\nand change the text here. I'll type, learn a new language. And the third one is travel to Europe. There we go. All right. So we have everything here. So we have a number representing\nthe sequence, a picture representing the goal, and the\ntext representing the goal as well. Let's click on the animations tab. Now, here's the animations tab. Here are different types of\nanimations that we can use. We're just going to\nuse a simple animation. We'll just use the wipe animation. You can try them out. when you pause the video. I'll go ahead and click on my\npicture here, and I want my picture to come in with an animation. So I'll choose the wipe\nanimation for my picture. So that's the first\nanimation on the slide. If I click on preview over here to\nthe top left, I can get a preview to see what this will look like. So when I, when I go from slide\nnumber one to slide number two, This is how it will be revealed\nafter I click on the sequence here. So let's just animate our pictures. So we can see the numbers here. Here's the first animation. Here's the second animation. And then we'll have a\nthird animation over here. So I'll click on my airplane here. I'll click on wipe. And let's see what this looks like. So I'll go ahead and run\nthis in reading view. Again, reading view is great\nbecause it doesn't take up the whole screen, and I can still\nmanage other windows if I want to. So I'll click on the reading here. And there we go. So this is what the slide looks like. So we can see that we have the text\nboxes and the numbers in the sequence. If I click next, or if I click to the\nright, it reveals that picture for me. If I click to the right again,\nhere's the other picture. And if I click to the right one more\ntime, here is the third one here as well. So animation is a really good\nway to kind of reveal things. or to reveal a lot of content on one\nslide, just one at a time, as opposed to revealing all the content here as well. I'm going to go back to normal\nview, go back to slide two. So that's not really what I want though. What if I want, you know, my text box and\nmy picture to come in at the same time? If I go ahead and give my text\nbox here an animation, Well, it's not going to come in in sequence. So what I want to do, I want to create\nan animation so that my text box and my picture comes in at the same time. Same thing here for the second one and\nthe same thing here for the third one. So I'm going to have three\nanimations on this slide. So when this slide is seen,\nthe only things that will be visible are my actual numbers. Right here. One, two, and three. So your audience already knows\nthey're expecting three different goals or content here as well. So to do that, I'm going to go\nahead and remove the animations. So I'll say none. Just going to reset everything here. Okay, now I'll do it. Picture, text box, wipe. One animation. picture, hold down the\ncontrol key, text box, wipe. There's my second animation,\npicture, text box, wipe. And there we go. Let's go ahead and run that. I'll press, uh, F5 to\nrun the presentation. Here's my title slide. Here's my second slide. We can see the numbers here. If I click or if I press next, Or if I\nuse the arrow key, notice how it comes in as one animation because we group\nthe text box and the picture together. I could have even grouped the shape\ndown here with it if I wanted to. But I wanted to keep it\nsimple, kind of like a reveal. So here's animation number\ntwo, learn a new language. Animation number three, travel to Europe. And we're good to go. So pretty good. So go ahead and check out\nthe different animations. Just click on a picture, check out\nthe different animations that are available, and then go ahead and\ngroup your animations together. You may need to remove the animations\nand then group them like I did so you don't run into any conflicts. So check them out, go ahead and\nanimate them and come right back. We'll move on to our next lesson. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number six. Adding tables. Adding tables is a great way to\ncondense information so that your audience can basically interpret\nthe information more efficiently. Let's go ahead and insert a table. We want a table that looks like this. So instead of writing out our one\nyear goals, we can express our one year goals in the form of a table. So we'll have a title, We'll have\nour different headers here, the goal, the priority, the progress,\nand the estimated cost for that particular goal here as well. So let's go ahead and use this. I'll go back to slide number three, and\nbecause I'm using a content placeholder, I can go ahead and insert a table by\nclicking on the table icon right here. The other way to insert a table\nis to click on the insert tab. And once I click on the\ninsert tab, so here's table. So those are two ways that\nwe can insert a table. Now let's just quickly take a look at the\ndifferent ways that we can insert a table. If I click on this drop down here,\nI can go ahead and draw the table. As you can see, if I want like a four\nby four table, my slide is already showing what that table will look like. That's probably the\nsimplest way to do that. I can also insert a table. So if I click on insert a table, it\nbasically asks me how many columns and how many rows would I like. So I can say four by four. I'm going to go ahead and hit cancel here. We also have the capability to use an\nExcel spreadsheet to to insert a table. We'll take a look at\nthat just a little bit. The Excel spreadsheet is going to give\nus the Excel ribbon that will allow us to incorporate more advanced features of\nthe table, such as calculations and more styles and designs, things like that. For now, let's go ahead and click\non the insert table icon inside of our content placeholder. And it gives us the option, how many\ncolumns and how many rows do we want? Well, for now, let's just say we want\nthree columns, and we want three rows. Let's go ahead and press OK. My content placeholder has\nbeen replaced by my 3x3 table. Before I start working on the table, I\nmight want to go ahead and give it a name. quick design. So notice, because we're working\nwith a table, we actually have two contextual tabs. One is for the table design. So this is all things cosmetic. And then we have the layout. So with these two tabs gives\nus all the tools we need to be able to manage this table. We'll keep it simple. We'll take a look at some of the essential\ntools that we'd need to use for now. I'm going to go ahead and\nchoose a table design. So When it comes to the table design,\nwe can see that we have recommended best match for our document. Don't like those though. We have light styles. We have medium styles, and then\nwe have some dark tables down here at the bottom as well. So kind of a table for all\ndifferent types, whatever you're looking for here as well. I'm going to go for a medium table. I'll give it this medium style\naccent one, and I'm good to go. Let's go ahead and enter\nsome data into our table. So the very top line is\ngoing to be my title. So I'll just call this one year goals. Down here on the bottom, the first\none is going to be my actual goal. I'll press the tab key\nto move to the next cell. So that's my goal. This will be the priority. Let's say on a scale of,\nuh, you know, 1 to 10. 10 being the highest priority. And then over here,\nlet's put the progress. How far I am along that goal here. I'll add my first goal. And my first goal, let's\nsay enroll and martial arts. Okay, I'll put the priority. This is priority, high priority. So I'll go 10 and the progress. This is actually about\n50 percent complete. Right, but I do have other goals. I want to go ahead and\nadd another row here. So to do that, I'm going\nto click on the layout tab. Now once I click on the layout tab,\nall the way to the far left we see a rows and columns command group. Now this is where I want to\ngo ahead and insert rows. So I can insert a row above,\nI can insert a row below. I do want to insert a row below, so I'll\ngo ahead and click on insert row below. As a matter of fact, I want two\nrows, so I'll click it two times. to add two rows. And there we go. I'll go ahead and enter my data in here. I also want another column to the\nright because I want to be able to add one more for the estimated cost. So I'll click on the column, and\nnow I can either, now that I've selected this particular column, I\ncan either insert one to the left or I can insert one to the right. I want to insert one to\nthe right, not to the left. So I'll click on insert\nright to add another column. There we go, I'll go ahead\nand put in the estimated cost and there we go. So that's how we insert a table. That's how we choose a\ntable design or table style. That's how we add a row and or a column. We can simply just type in each of\nthese cells and enter our information. Go ahead and fill out the rest of your\ntable and come right back and we'll take a look at some other table tools. Welcome back. So I went ahead and inserted all\nof my text here into my table. So what I want to do now, I\nwant to go ahead and merge the cells here on this top row. So as you can see, I have\none, two, three, four cells. I want to merge them and just have\none single cell for my title that will be centered here as well. So to do that, I'm going to go ahead\nand select Just click and drag and highlight all these cells on that top row. Then I'll click on the Layout tab. Now on the Layout tab, let's talk\nabout formatting the actual table. So when we're formatting the table,\nwe're talking about the Layout tab here. And over here in the Merge Cells\ncommand group, I'm going to go ahead and choose the Merge Cells command. That will convert these\nfour cells into one. I'll go ahead and do that here. And there we go. I can see that it's just\none cell here at the top. But the next thing I want to do,\nI want to go ahead and align it. So right now it's aligned\nto the left of the cell. As a matter of fact, if you take a look\non the layout tab in the alignment command group, we can see that it's basically\naligned to the top left of that cell. Actually, by default, all of my\ncells here, everything is aligned to the top left of that cell. of each cell. So for this particular cell, I\nwant to go ahead and make sure that everything is centered to the middle. So I'll go ahead and click center and center. So now it's centered vertically and\nhorizontally in this cell as well. Now, I want to do the same thing\nwith the rest of my, my table. So notice when I ran that command, it\nonly applied to this particular cell. So it only applies to\nwhat you have selected. So I'm going to go ahead and press\nControl A inside of my table. So if I press Control A, it highlights\neverything on my table here. Once I do that, I'm going to\ngo ahead and center everything. So there we go. I was able to center\neverything and I'm good to go. Now I do want my table to\nstand out a little bit here. Let's see what else we can do. So we took a look at\ninserting rows and columns. We used the merge. We took a look at some\nalignment options here as well. Now, We can go ahead and interact with the\ncell size if we want to, or I can click on my table and click on distribute columns. So, if I click here, nothing really happens. If I click on distribute rows, nothing\nreally, well, I do get a little bit here. So it attempts to make every row the same\nheight and every column the same width. It looks like all of my columns are\nalready the same width, so it did not really make any changes here as well. So if you maybe inherited a PowerPoint\nfile that has a table, and things just look really uneven, you can\nchoose the Distribute Rows and Distribute Columns command, and that\nwill take care of things for you. I can also resize the table if I\ngrab one of the fill handles here. Right? Right now it's perfectly aligned,\nbut if I want to make it bigger, I can go ahead and do that. I can even kind of do this. So you can pretty much resize the table\nin any fashion that you want here as well. So I'm good to go. So again, any formatting options,\nwe need to click on the layout tab to be able to do that as well. Now if you want to delete a particular row\nor a particular column, it's a matter of. clicking on the row. You don't have to\nhighlight the entire row. If you want to, that's okay. Just click on any row that you want to. And here's the delete command. So we can delete the entire table. We can delete the entire row,\nor we can delete that column. If I choose delete row,\nit deletes the row for me. Now I only have these three rows here. I'm going to go ahead and undo that. So I'll press control Z\nor I'll just press undo. There's my row again. Same applies for deleting a column. Just choose the delete. And you can choose to delete\na particular column as well. So those are the basics\nfor formatting a table. Go ahead and make those formats. Last thing I'll do, I want my\ntop two rows here to be bold. I want it to stand out. And I want my items on the\nleft to stand out as well. I'll make those bold. And there we go. I'm all done. If you want to go ahead and change the\ntable style, you can go ahead and do that. And come right back. So we were able to insert a table. Just to note, we can also copy a table\nfrom another Microsoft Office application. So if we have an existing table\nin a Microsoft Excel file, we can copy and paste that table\nright here into PowerPoint. And we can manage the\ntable in here as well. If we had a table in Microsoft Word,\nwe can also copy and paste that here. We can also copy and paste a table from\na web page and manage it here as well. For now, I want to go ahead\nand insert a new slide. So I'll insert a title only slide\nand I'll quickly just demo how we can add tables via Excel. So maybe you want some more tools to be\nable to kind of work with your table. Let's go ahead and click\non the insert tab here. And let's use the Excel\nspreadsheet option. So I'll go ahead and click\non Excel spreadsheet. And it's thinking and notice\nit opens up the Excel. So notice here's my PowerPoint up here. But right now I'm working\nwith the Excel interface. So basically my ribbon has been\nreplaced by the Excel here. Well, this gives me all the tools I need. I'm going to make this a little wider. So here's my Excel spreadsheet. And now I can go ahead and\ndo something like go ahead and just add my data in here. So maybe I'll just put some\nbasic information in here. I'll just put a sales rep and I'll pause this and finish this up. So you don't have to watch\nme type everything here. Okay, so here's my completed data here. So I have a few sales reps. We're tracking their weekly sales. So, for example, week one, Jane D. had sales of 21, 38, 32. Now, this is where the Excel interface\ncomes in, because now I can use the Excel tool, so I can give all\nthese the, uh, accounting format. And I could even drop in some\nsummaries and things in here if I want to use some calculations. I'll keep it simple though. I'm simply going to\nconvert this to a table. And I'll go for, we'll\ngo for this style here. All right. So here's my nice table. And once I'm done, I simply just need to\nclick away So how do we get rid of this? Once I click away, I click on\na blank area on my slide here. It's going to close the Excel overlay and\nit's going to insert this table for me. So I'll go ahead and click away from it. I'm done. And there is my table. Sometimes this will happen. It's actually showing too much detail. I don't want all of these\nblank cells in here. So, doesn't happen all the time. So, to overcome that, I want to\ngo ahead and edit this table. Now, one thing to note, notice after\nI inserted the table, PowerPoint is not treating it as a table. It's treating it as a shape. So, I cannot make any\nadjustments here to the table. If I want to edit it, I\nneed to double click on it. So, I'll double click the table. the shape here rather. And now it reopens the\nExcel overlay for me. I'm just going to resize this window here. I only want to see these particular cells. Let's see if this will work for me. There we go. Now it's misbehaving. There we go. And let's close that. Let's see what that looks like. Okay. So almost there. I'm going to make this a little bigger. Okay, this, so this basically gives us\nthe result of what we created in Excel. We cannot make any changes here,\nbut if we want to, we simply just need to double click on it and we can go ahead and make any changes. Like for example, I'm going\nto remove the filters. I don't need those buttons\nshowing up here at the top and still trying to get rid of this little problematic. There we go. So I'll click away. And there we go. So that looks better. So it's almost treating this as\na picture or an output as well. So if you want to use Excel to just\nhave some more robust functions and features and calculations, you can\nuse the Excel overlay to insert your table into PowerPoint here as well. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and take it a\nstep further by adding a chart to our PowerPoint presentation. So just like with a table, we have\ntwo opportunities to insert a chart. I can either click on the Insert\ntab, go ahead and insert a chart. I can insert a chart from my\ncontent placeholder as well. I can also insert a chart from Microsoft\nExcel so I can copy and paste an existing chart from Microsoft Excel. We'll keep it simple, we'll\ngo ahead and insert a chart. Now when we insert a chart, we will\nget a temporary Excel basic interface. We basically need to add\nour data to the interface. Let's go ahead and click on insert chart\nand let's see what we are provided with. So the first thing it asks us is, well,\nwhat type of chart do we want to use? So we have clustered column,\na really nice chart to be able to display a lot of values. We have line charts, pie charts. We can always change this a little later. Some of the more modern ones\nlike a tree map or sunburst. These are pretty good for. displaying one value at a\ntime, or one series at a time. I'll keep it simple. I'll insert that first\nclustered column chart. I'll press OK. So we'll notice that we have two things. I'm going to move this around\njust a little bit here. Here's our Excel window up here at the\ntop, and down here is the actual chart. I'm going to resize this,\nmake this a little bigger so I can see all of the data. So basically, whatever data we place\nThis in our little Excel window here will be displayed on the actual chart. So for example, if I were to put,\nlet's say my name here, right, maybe as a sales rep, I'll go for just a couple here. So we can see as we're typing the\ninformation in Excel, we can see that it's appearing down here. on our chart. So it's all based on the\ndata that we have up there. Now I could actually copy and\npaste the data in here as well. If I already have the data from Excel\nor from the table that I created earlier, I can paste it in here as well. But let's just put in a couple\nof quarterly sales values here. And I'll just start\nplugging in some numbers. So let's go 5, 000. So as you can see, it's already\ndisplaying here on our chart. I'm going to go ahead and\nput the dollar sign in front. These here as well. Because when we turn on the data\nlabels, we want to be able to see the dollar signs as well. I'll put, uh, put 2, 500 for here. 4400. This is going to be 2000. So I'll just follow the numbers\nhere, multiples of a thousand. So 3500, 1800, 3000, and 4500, and 5k. And there we go. So that's it. So once I close this here,\nHere is my actual chart. So that is how you insert a chart. And that is how you\nadd data to your chart. Go ahead and add some data. Come right back. We'll take a look at some customizations. We'll take a look at how we can edit\nthe data and so forth and so on. Now we were able to insert a chart, add\nsome data to the chart here as well. What if we wanted to do\nsomething like edit the data? Well, we have two contextual\ntabs here for the chart. Really it's just the chart design though. The format, just really some of the\nshape formatting tools that we can use. I'll stick to chart design. And under chart design, just like\nwith our table, we can choose a style. Now these styles are based on\nthe theme that you have selected. I did choose the wood type\ntheme, so here are the different styles that I have available. I can also edit the data if I want to. So what if I wanted to make\nsome changes to the data here? What if M Jones did not have 7,\n000 for quarter three, but 8, 000? Well, I can go ahead and do that. So I'll go ahead and click on\nedit data and basically reopens the Excel overlay for us. And now for quarter three, instead\nof 8, 000, I'll put, I'm sorry, 7, 000, I'll put, uh, 8, 000. We can already see. It's being applied here as well. I'm going to go ahead and close this. Now, before I close this, another\nthing that I can do while I'm here, so I can actually change or update\nmy data here, I can also decide what I want to be displayed on the chart. So, for example, what if I only\nwanted quarter one and quarter two to be displayed on the\nchart, but not quarter three? So we just want to focus\non the first half results. If you take a look at the bottom\nright, here's our little fill handle, that little square. So this basically lets us\nknow how far our data reaches. So right now it goes\nto column D and row 5. If I drag this over to column\nC and row 5, it's only going to show quarter 1 and quarter 2. So let's take a look at that. I'm going to go ahead and\ngrab this handle right here. So notice I have a white cross. When I move my cursor over that\nlittle small square, it changes to a diagonal two way arrow. That lets me know that I'm ready\nto go ahead and interact with it. I'm going to go ahead and click\nand hold and drag it to the left so that only quarter one and\nquarter two are being displayed. If I let go, take a look at my chart. We can see that only quarter one and\nquarter two are being displayed here now. So that's a quick way to kind\nof pick and choose what you want to be displayed on your chart. I do want quarter three as well. I'll go back over here and\nI'll go ahead and close it. So that's pretty much how you edit\ndata and how you select data as well. If you want to select your data the\ntraditional way, you click on the select data here, and we get this option over\nhere where we can choose what we want to be displayed, or we can just go\nahead and highlight the ranges that we want to be displayed here as well. I'm going to go ahead and hit cancel. I'll close this out and I'm good to go. Let's talk about chart design. Now, when we're customizing the chart,\nthere's a lot of options that we can use. We'll just take a look at\nsome of the essentials here. At the top right of the chart,\nyou'll notice these two icons. The first one with the plus sign,\nthese are the chart elements. Second one here is the paintbrush. If you hover over the chart elements,\nit tells us that we can add or remove things like the title, the legend,\nthe grid lines, and the data labels. If you hover over the\npaintbrush, we can set a style and color scheme for our chart. We'll do both. First, let's go ahead and click\non the chart elements here. And you'll notice we can turn things\noff or on, like turn the axis off or on. Right now it's turned on. I'll go ahead and turn it off. And as you can see, we, we lost\nall of our labels down here. So it's pretty difficult to\nexplain what we're looking at here. So I'll leave those turned on. And the access titles. So this just gives us\na little more detail. There's an extra text box here on\nthe vertical and horizontal plane. We can type in there,\nadd some more content. We can even format the text\nthat's in here if we want to. Change the font, the color, the size. I don't need that. I'll go ahead and turn that off. Here's my chart title. I'll go ahead and actually\nput something in here. I'll say quarterly sales. And as I mentioned before, I can go\nahead and change the color if I want to. Make it like a, uh, make it\nbold and italicized as well. Now for each of these elements, you'll\nnotice that there's a small arrow to the right of it indicating that we have\nsome other options such as the title that's being overlaid or above the chart. We have data labels. So if we turn the data labels on,\nwe can see the numerical values on top of each of the bars as well. Here's the data table. This is like a hybrid chart. So we have the chart on the\ntop, and then we have the Excel table down here on the bottom. This works well if you have a small table. If you have a large table,\nyou may not want to use that. I'll go ahead and turn that off. The good thing with the data table,\nit does come with its own legend. So I can actually turn off this\nlegend down here and save a little bit of space as well. We have error bars, not\nreally applicable here. And then we have the gridlines, we can\nturn them off, we can turn them on. I don't really need them if you have\nthe numbers here, and then we have the legend, I can turn them off or\non, or I can move them to the right. Now they're over here to the right, or I\ncan move them to the, let's see, move to the left as well, the top, the bottom. I'll leave them here on the bottom. So those are the different chart elements. Let's click on the paintbrush. So when you click on the paintbrush,\nyou'll notice that you have 14 different styles to choose from. So here's style 14, and this\nis a really nice way to quickly choose a design for your chart. Some of these will kind of\nmove things around for you. So style number two, you\ncan see my legend has moved. You can see that my values over\nhere on the vertical axis are gone. And take a look at the way that my\ndata labels are being displayed. They're vertical instead of horizontal. So go ahead and choose\none of these styles. I like style number\neight, nice dark style. I also like style 14 as well. You can also choose a color. So depending on the theme that you\nhave selected, you have different colorful palettes to choose from. And then you also, on the bottom, you\nhave different monochromatic, different shades of the same color here as well. So, go ahead and modify your chart. Go ahead and interact with\nsome of the chart elements. Go ahead and choose a chart style. Change the color as well. And, come right back. Now, after formatting the chart, there's\nsome other things that we can do. Before we insert a chart from\nExcel, we can also change the chart. So, if I click on the Chart Design tab,\nif I want to change this to another type of chart, I can go ahead and do so. Great. This brings us back to our first window\nwhere we can change the type of chart. So if I wanted a stack column\nchart, I can go ahead and do that. If I want a 3D clustered\ncolumn, I can do that. If I want a line chart, here are\ndifferent line charts that will integrate my existing data for me. If I want a pie chart, I remember\na pie chart tends to just focus on one value at a time. Here as well. So it looks like it's focusing\non the, let's see what week that is, a particular week. It looks like the week or the quarter three, not\nsure which one that is. And we have a bar and\nlet's see the tree map. So the tree map here, the bigger\nthe box, the higher the value. So again, this is going to be\nbased on quarters here as well. So we can change this to a different type. Let's try the tree map. We'll go ahead and press. Okay. And if I hover over it, it\nsays this is 5, 000, doesn't really give me too much detail. I will need to go ahead and, um,\nbasically go ahead and, and go into the advanced menu to kind of change\nto see what's being displayed here. So I'm gonna go ahead and change\nthis back to a clustered column. I'll go for 3D, I'll press\nOK, and I'm good to go. Now, let's go ahead. I'm going to go to insert another\nslide here, and this time I'm just going to go ahead and insert or copy\na chart, paste a chart from Excel. And let's see what options\nwe have here as well. I already have my chart. Here's my Excel window. So here's a chart that\nI created from the data. So I already have my chart here,\nso I don't feel like building this all over again in PowerPoint. So I'll write, I'll click on the chart. I'll right click on it. I'll copy it to the clipboard. I'll come back to PowerPoint. I'll click inside of this content\nplaceholder and I'll go ahead and paste it so I can use the destination theme and\nembed the chart into PowerPoint so I can manage the chart right here in PowerPoint. Or I can just kind of override the theme\nthat I'm currently using and basically carry over the theme from Excel. I don't want to do that. I prefer to stick to\nthe destination theme. And then we have use the\ndestination theme and link the data. So basically what this will allow us\nto do, if I make any changes to that chart in Excel will automatically\nupdate here in PowerPoint. Same thing here, and\nthen we have a picture. So I'll go ahead and use the\ndestination theme and link the data. So there we go. So here's our chart. Let's take a look at week one here. So this is the week one for Sarah. So Sarah week 20. Let's go ahead and make a change\nhere in Excel for Sarah's week 1. And to do that, I need to\ngo right here, Sarah week 1. I'll change this to 5, 000. We can see the chart has\nupdated here for Sarah. Let's take a look at PowerPoint. And there we go. We can see that it updates\nright away as well. So that's pretty much how that works. So if I want to make any edits, I simply\nneed to edit the data on the Excel file. And as long as I have PowerPoint\nopen, it's going to go ahead and update that for me automatically. Very good. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to lesson 8. So, we'll just talk about preparing\nto deliver a presentation. Now, when it comes to doing\nthis, what we want to do is we want to run our spell checker. Now, we'll notice that the spell\nchecker is already kind of running in the background, so if I had any\ngrammatical errors, it would have already caught it for me, but I'll go\nahead and run the spell checker anyway. Spell check is complete. I'm good to go. The next thing to do is to check\nour animations and our transitions. Right now we don't have\nany transitions in here. Let's go ahead and run the presentation. Let's go ahead and save it first. So I'll press control s, make sure\nit's saved to my computer, and then I'll go ahead and run the presentation. So remember, if I want to run\nthe presentation, I can either press F5, I can go ahead and click\non the start slideshow from the beginning, from the slideshow tab. I can also click on the slideshow icon\nhere as well, so whichever one you want to, I'll click on the slideshow tab\nand I'll run this from the beginning. There's the shortcut right there. F five to start the show\nfrom the first slide. So here's my slide that I animated. Really nice slide. Everything is nicely\naligned there as well. Here's my table. Here's my Excel table. Here's my chart. Here's my Excel chart. Here's lesson eight. And then that's the end of\nthe slideshow here as well. Let's add a transition. I'll click on transitions here. And the transitions basically allow us\nto have some kind of entrance effect as we go from one slide to the next. So I'll choose a There's\na lot of transitions here. I want you to go ahead and try them all. And choose the ones that you like. Some are very simple,\nsome are very complex. If we scroll down, we can see we\ncan even have the previous slide folding into the shape often. origami bird here. So lots of transitions that we can use. I tend to stick to the simple\nones, something like wipe or push. I like the push transition. That's what it looks like. Almost like you're scrolling\nthrough a endless web page. If I use the wipe, this is like\nyou're kind of reading a book, turning the pages as well. I'll go ahead and choose\nthe push transition. And now, after I, after I've\nchosen the push transition, what I want to do, I want to make sure\nto apply it to all of my slides. Right, so I'll click on apply\nto all, because right now, if I were to run this slideshow, so I can see, it only applies the\ntransition for the first slide. So what I'll do is, I'll click on apply\nto all, Make sure that's checked off. And let's test that here. There we go. So it's pushing down to each slide. So pretty nice. I'll press escape to\nexit the slideshow here. And here we go. So that is pretty much how that works. Let's go ahead and animate our chart. So let's go ahead and click on\nthe chart that we inserted here. So I'll click on the chart. Let's go to animations, and\nlet's use the wipe animation. I want to show you\nsomething pretty cool here. So notice if I apply an animation\nto the chart, the entire chart comes in all at once. That's not really helpful. It would be nice if I can have the chart\ncome in, you know, kind of one by one, like maybe M Jones total first, and\nthen J Power, and so forth and so on. Well, let's take a look\nand see what we can do. Depending on the animation that\nyou choose, sometimes you will have effect options, which means you can\ndetermine how the animation works. Well, let's take a look at this. If I click on effect options\nhere, again, this is for my chart. So by default, it's\ncoming in as one object. Let's see what happens if I\nchoose to come in by series. Look at that. That's pretty cool. So it's coming in by quarter one, then\nquarter two, and then quarter three. We preview that again. Pretty nice. The other effect option is by category. So there we have the sales rep, M. Jones, and then J. Power, E. Cohen, and then R. Gupta. I'll try one more. Now we're going one by one in\nsequence, which is pretty cool. So we do have options when it comes\nto animating our chart as well. We don't have the same for our\ntables though, but we can do it for our chart here as well. So very good. So go ahead and just run\nthrough your slideshow. Go ahead and apply a transition. Make sure to apply it\nto all of your slides. Choose the one that you like. Go ahead and add an\nanimation for your chart. Go ahead and choose one\nof the effect options. Five to choose from. And come right back and we'll take\na look at the morph transition. Welcome back. Now let's finish up lesson 8 by\ntalking about the morph transition. So if I click over here on the\ntransitions tab, I can see that I have the morph transition. This is a pretty nice transition, really\nadds some nice flair, um, and some dynamic content to your presentation here as well. Let's go ahead and take a look and see\nwhat the morph transition is all about. I want to discuss three different\nplanets, Saturn, Mars, and Earth. But when I want to emphasize Earth, I want\nEarth to appear bigger than the others. And when I'm finished discussing\nEarth, I want to focus on Saturn. So Saturn will get bigger. and my other two here will get smaller. It's going to appear as if I'm\nstill working on one slide. As you can see down here, I\nhave one, two, three slides. Let's go ahead and run the presentation\nand let's see what this looks like. I'll go to reading mode here. Okay, so here's my slide. I'm getting ready to discuss\nthese three different planets. If I click next, so look at that. So earth kind of morphs into shape. increasing in size while Saturn and\nMars morphs into a smaller shape. While I'm finished discussing\nEarth, let's focus on Saturn now. So I want Saturn to increase in size\nwhile Mars and Earth decreases in size. So if I click next to go to the next\nslide, still appears I'm on the same slide but things are just kind of\nmorphing into shape here as well. So that is the morph transition. So pretty, pretty cool. So, let's go ahead and\nwork on this together. First, I want you to go ahead, go\nahead and insert three text boxes, and go ahead and insert three icons. So, just click on the Insert\ntab, go ahead and insert an icon, and we have one for Saturn, we have one for Mars, and we have one So, go ahead and insert those\nthree icons, and insert those three text boxes, like this. Right now, in terms of size, I\nhave my icons are all about 2. 58 high and wide as well. So go ahead and add those six\nobjects and come right back. Let's go ahead and apply\nthe morph transition. So it's a three step process\nif we hover over the morph. It tells us the first thing we\nneed to do is duplicate a slide. And that's it. And then step two, on the duplicated\nslide, just move things around. And then step three, apply\nthe morph transition. So let's go ahead and do that. We already have our slide. This is what it looks like. So I'll go ahead and duplicate this slide. To duplicate a slide, we can click\non the slide here on the left pane. If we right click on it,\nwe can choose the type. Duplicate slide command. We can also press ctrl D and\nthat will duplicate it for us. Okay, so here's the original slide\nand here's the duplicated slide. So let's focus on the duplicated slide. So for here, I'm simply\ngoing to resize things. So for my two, for Saturn and Mars, I\nwant to decrease these to one, one by one. So for the height, I'll just do that. That takes care of that. For earth, I want this to grow to four. So I'll type four here. So again, just click on the icon on the\ngraphics format and the size command group, just type a number for the\nheight and it makes it four by four. Going to increase the\nwidth of my text box here. So it's just a little\nbigger and that's about it. I want to keep it simple. Don't want to do too much. So I do want to be able to\nduplicate this slide as well. I want to keep it going because on the\nnext slide I want to make everything else smaller and increase the size of Saturn. So all we're doing right now\non the duplicated slide, we're just following the steps. We're moving things around. resizing them. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthis slide as well. So I've duplicated the duplicated slide. And for this one, I'll put the, put\nthis back to one inch for Earth. I'll fix my text box here as well. And then for Saturn, I'll\nincrease the size to four. There we go. Now I have to kind of move things around. I'll move this to the left a little bit\nso it's not overlapping with my Mars here. And I'll increase the size\nof the text box as well. And there we go. So the transition from slide, from this\nslide to this one is going to be morph. And the transition from this slide to\nmy last one is also going to be morph. So what I'll do is I'll click on\nthat second to last slide, and I'll click on the morph transition. Here's a nice little preview\nof what it would look like. I'll go to my last slide, and I'll also\napply the morph transition as well. I don't want to apply the morph\ntransition for my first slide, because there's nothing to morph yet. So I'm just morphing. my two duplicated slides here as well. So let's run this in reading mode. See what this looks like. So here's my slide. If I click next in the sequence, there it is. My earth and my text box is growing. Everything else shrinks. And there we go. So pretty, pretty cool. Now I could even move things around. In this case, I just resized them, but I\ncould have actually moved things around. And we will see it\nmorphing into its shape. Let's actually do one more. I'll go ahead and duplicate this one. And let's move them around this time. So right click, I'll go\nahead and duplicate this one. Because I duplicated it, it\nautomatically inherits the morph transition, so no need to do that. And on this last slide here, I'm going\nto go ahead and move things around. So I'll go ahead and, let's\nsee, maybe I'll, I'm going to make this smaller actually. Don't need that to be that big. There we go, I'm going to resize this\njust to make a little room for my other items here as well. Maybe what I'll do is I'll\ngo ahead and stagger these. So Saturn will be here. Mars will be here. And Earth is going to\nbe down here somewhere. And I'll put everything back to one inch. Not perfect, but we just want to\ngo ahead and kind of see how this transforms into here as well. So let's go back. This time I'll run it in slideshow view. Okay, so here's the first slide. Here's our first morph. Our second morph. And let's see what our\nthird morph looks like. Pretty, pretty cool. So everything is moving into,\ninto shape here as well. Alright, very good. So go ahead and run the morph transition. Go ahead and duplicate\nas many as you like. What I've seen a lot of professionals\ndo, They morph a few times and come back to the original slide as the last slide. So you can do that if you want to\nand come back and we'll wrap up. Welcome back. Well, hopefully you had fun\nwith the morph transition. The next thing to do here is\nto print our presentation. If we do decide to print it via paper,\nwe can press control plus P and that will open up the print dialog for us. I'll go ahead and press control P. Here's the print dialog. Here's the true preview of what, of\nwhat the printouts would look like as long as we're using a color printer\nand I can scroll through my slides. I can see what they look like and I\ncan make any changes if I need to. So we have all the basic print dialogue\nsettings that we need to be able to use. If you do have the Microsoft printer PDF\nprinter, we can actually save this as a PDF file and that we can distribute. That's a good idea. Maybe your recipient does not\nhave a copy of Microsoft Office. Any modern browser can read a PDF as well. So, very good. I'm going to go back here,\nand we're good to go. Now, we covered a lot here in this\nintroductory course, and we have all the essentials that we need\nto create a dynamic presentation. As a quick recap, we're able to, in Module\n1, understand the PowerPoint interface, we're able to design a presentation,\nwe're able to insert and format text, spend some time inserting and formatting\nimages, then for Module 2, we're able to work with objects, grouping,\naligning, inserting and manage tables. charts as well. Then we're able to take a look\nat different types of animations and transitions as well. So congratulations on completing the\ncourse and I look forward to seeing all of you in a future course at LearnIt. Hello and welcome to\nMicrosoft PowerPoint Advanced. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. For our advanced course, we have two\nmodules, so module three and module four. For Module 3, we'll take a look at how we\ncan customize the PowerPoint environment. We'll take a look at how we\ncan customize design templates. It's all about the Slide Master. We'll save a design as a template\nthat we can either share or reuse over and over again. We'll also go ahead and take a look at\ncreating infographics with SmartArt. No need to search the\nweb for infographics. We can make our own. There's an extensive library\nof capabilities right here inside of Microsoft PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and dive in. Please open up the PowerPoint Module\n3 exercise file and come right back. We'll dive right into customizing\nthe PowerPoint environment. I currently have my module\nthree practice file open here, and here we have a few slides. And here is lesson one,\ncustomizing the environment. So one of the things that we'll\ndo is we'll go ahead and create our own ribbon tab, and then\nwe'll add our own commands to it. And then we'll also go ahead and set\nsome global options, just some useful options that may help us as well. In particular, what I would like to do\nis add some of these tools that will help me as I'm designing my presentation,\nsuch as the animation pane, the beloved eyedropper, the selection pane that\nhelps us to organize objects on a slide, and of course the slide master. So to do that, right now, in order\nto get to the eyedropper, I could add it to my quick access toolbar. That's one thing that I can do, or I\nneed to be interacting with an object, and then I can go ahead and pull up\nthe eyedropper from there as well. But what if I don't feel like clicking\non the contextual tab, clicking on shape fill, and clicking on the eyedropper? Well, let's go ahead and\nadd our own ribbon tab. We're going to right click on any one\nof these tabs, and just click on the option that says customize the ribbon. So I'll click on customize the ribbon. We get to this PowerPoint options\ndialog, and on the left we can see that we can customize the ribbon. Here are all the commands, well,\nat least the popular commands. I'm going to change this to all commands. So I'll change this to all commands. Now I can see all the commands\nthat are in PowerPoint. Over here on the right, I can\nsee that I have some, I can see the tabs that I have here. So, for example, here's the Home tab, and\nthe Home tab has the Clipboard command group, Paragraph, so forth and so on. Well, I want to create my own. As you can see, I do have a couple\nof pre made ones here as well. So, for example, I created\na tab called My Designs. And let's see what that looks like here. So when I created this tab, it comes\nwith a tab and then a command group. And then I have my\ncommands down here as well. I'm going to turn this on. Let's see what this looks like here. And then we'll go ahead and recreate it. So if I enable that, I'll go ahead\nand find it here on my ribbon. Here it is, my designs. So now if I click on my designs, I\ncan quickly access the animation pane. I can turn on the eyedropper right away\nand apply a particular color to that content placeholder there, if I want to. And I can also turn on the selection\npane, take a look at all the different objects on my slide. I can also access the slide\nmaster right from here as well. So that's what we can do. So let's go ahead and create our own. Let's go back to\ncustomize the ribbon here. And to do that, the first thing we need\nto do is click on the new tab option here. So we'll click on new tab. So here is our new tab right here. Has a generic name, new tab. It has a generic command group. Let's go ahead and rename both of those. So for the new tab, I'll click on rename. Maybe I'll call that design 24. Go ahead and press OK. And for the command group,\nI'll rename that as well. Click on rename. You can also choose an\nicon if you want to. We'll go ahead and choose this\nhere in the display name, it's going to be called design tools. Go ahead and press okay. So I'm good to go. I have my design tab. Here's my command group. The next thing for me to do is to\ngo ahead and actually add commands to that particular command group. So I want to make sure I have\ndesign tool selected here, and I'll change the commands from\npopular commands to all commands. So now what I can do is\nI can type the letter E. This will bring me down to the E commands. I want to look for the eyedropper. Here it is. I'll add the eyedropper in there\nso we can see how this works. So here's level one,\nwhich is the actual tab. level two, which is the command group. And then we have level three,\nwhich is the actual command. So let's go ahead and add some more. I'm going to go ahead\nand add the slide master. So I'll type the letter S and I'll\nlook for the slide master here. And again, you can pretty much add\nany, any command that you want. I'll just click on slide master. I'll also turn on the selection pane. And here we go. I'll add that. And I'll keep it simple. I'll just add one more. I'll go back to the A group and\nI'll add the animation pane. And I'm good to go. Here are my four commands. I'll press OK. And I'll go ahead and locate design 24. Here it is right here. And from here I can go ahead and I could\neven create another command group, name that, and add my own commands in here\nas well, and I can keep going as well. So that's what we want to do. So go ahead and customize your\nribbon, go ahead and create a ribbon tab, rename the command group, go\nahead and add some commands there as well, and come right back. Now that we are able to create\nour own tab, so here are my two tabs here, The next thing we can\ndo is turn on some useful options. I'll go back here. I'll right click on any of\nthese ribbon tabs and I'll go back to customizing the ribbon. This brings me to the\nPowerPoint options dialog here. So I'll go back to the general here and\nsome of these are turned on by default, but I find these to be pretty helpful\nwhen you're designing your presentation. So the first tab here on the general tab. I can see that I have some\nuser interface options. Now, if you're using two monitors, you may\nnotice that when you move your application from one window to the next, You may\nhave some appearance issues here as well. So you may want to go ahead and\noptimize for best appearance when you're using multiple displays. If you just kind of hover over the\nlittle information icon, it gives you some more information here as well. So you can toggle it back and\nforth, optimize for compatibility or optimize for best appearance. I like the mini toolbar on selection. This is. Pretty much whenever you highlight a chunk\nof text, it gives you the mini tool that allows you to do some quick formatting. A big part of designing in\nPowerPoint is live preview. So, for example, before we apply\na particular style or some type of feature, we can get a preview\njust by hovering the mouse over it. So I like to leave that\nturned on there as well. For those of us who like to collapse\nthe ribbon, remember we can always change the ribbon display options. I like to see the full\nribbon, so I'm good to go. You may want to collapse\nthe Microsoft search box. As you can see, I do have it over here. It is currently minimized, and this\nallows me a little more room if I'm using my quick access toolbar. I have some more room over\nhere to work with as well, so I can do that if I want to. I'll scroll down a little bit. Here's the PowerPoint designer. So when you're designing, you're\neither using a theme, you're using the slide master, or you're\nusing the PowerPoint designer. I have it turned off right now because\nI'm going to be using the slide master to design my presentation as well. If we go down to the save, go\ndown to the preserve fidelity when sharing this presentation. If you're using special fonts in your\npresentation, if your recipient does not have that particular font or set of fonts,\nthey will not be displayed properly. So you may want to embed the fonts in\nthe file so that even though they don't have those fonts installed, they will\nstill be able to view them as well. So that's another nice option\nto be able to use there. The other ones here. in terms of advanced. When it comes to printing, we can\nprint true type fonts as graphics. So that's another nice option\nthere as well, um, that we can use. And of course, if we go to the\nquick access toolbar here, just like how we can add any command to\nthe, the ribbon tab that we created, here are the current commands that\nare on my quick access toolbar. But I do have access\nto the entire library. So if I change this to all\ncommands, I can add any command to my quick access toolbar. And because I minimize the search\nbox here, I have a lot of room over here to be able to add\nsome of those commands as well. So those are just some options\nthat may help you as you continue to create designs in PowerPoint. Let's move on to lesson two,\ndesigning with the slide master. Now, what is the slide master? Let's go ahead and take a\nlook at the slide master. To get there, I need to go ahead\nand click on the view tab and get to the actual slide master. Once I'm there, I can do\nsomething like insert a layout. I can rename a layout and I can\ninsert content placeholders as well. Let's do something simple\nin the slide master. Let's go ahead and make universal\nchanges to our entire presentation. For example, we often\ndo this for each slide. Maybe we want to go ahead\nand change the title. Maybe we want to go ahead and do\nsomething like change the font. I'll go for this one and change the color\nand then go ahead and change the size. We go to our next slide. We do the same thing. Well, we don't have to do that. Instead of going to every single slide\nand changing the formatting options for all of our title placeholders,\nwe can do that in the Slide Master. So, I'm going to go ahead\nand undo all those changes. I'll press CTRL Z a few times here. Now I'm back to normal. Let's head on over to the Slide Master. I'll click on the View tab and And once\nI'm on the View tab, all the way to the far left, we'll see the Slide Master. Let's hover over the Slide\nMaster and see what it says. So Slide Master, it controls the look\nof your entire presentation, including colors, fonts, backgrounds, effects,\nand just about everything else. So I can insert a shape or a\nlogo, and it will show up on all of my slides automatically. Well, that sounds pretty good. Let me go ahead and click\non the Slide Master here. Now here we can notice that\nwe have a different view. Now we are in the Slide Master view. We can see that we now have the\nSlide Master tab, and we have some command groups here that\nare specific to our Slide Master. Now important to note, on the left,\nwe'll have different types of slides. What I want to do is scroll\nall the way to the top here. And you'll notice all the way at the\nvery top, we'll notice that a slide is bigger than all of our other slides. So in fact, this is the\nactual slide master. The other slides that we see here,\nthese are the different layouts. So here's the title and content layout. Here's the two content layout. Here's the comparison layout. So that's what that is. I'm going to go ahead and click\non the actual slide master here. And let's just get a good\nunderstanding of how this works. So whatever changes I make to this slide,\nit's going to affect all of my slides regardless of what type of layout it is. So I'm just going to do something simple. I'll go ahead and run it. I want all of my title slides to be\na particular font, color, and size. So I'll go ahead and highlight these,\nI'll go back to the Home tab, and I'll go ahead and apply the formatting there. Once we apply the formatting, we'll close\nthe Slide Master and take a look and see how our slides have been updated. Okay, I'll change this font here. I'm going to go with the Georgia font. Alright, so here's Georgia, and I\nwant it to be that nice Georgia blue, and I'll make it 40, and that's it. Now if you take a look, you'll notice,\ntake a look at my different layouts. So here's the title slide, we can see that\nthe title slide is already incorporating that formatting that I just applied. Here's the title and content slide layout. And we can see it's also\nincorporating that format that I've made to the slide master. Let's go back to the slide master. Let's go ahead and close the master view. This will put our presentation back\nto the original or normal view. And let's take a look to see\nif our slides were updated. And we can see that they were. So here's my title slide. Here's slide number two. So all of my slides now have that\nuniversal formatting for my title. Let's take it a step further. Let's go back into the Slide Master. And let's see what else we can do here. Again, I want to make sure I\nclick on that very top slide here. And what I'm going to do is\nfor all of my level, I want to change my bullets actually. I want to highlight these\nfive bullet levels here. And I'll go to the Home tab. And instead of having those\nregular bullets, maybe I want something like hollow squares. So I'll go ahead and\nchoose hollow squares. And for my level one item, maybe I\nwant that to be, let's say, orange. My level two item is on the list. Maybe I want that to be,\nwe'll go with purple. And that's it. Let's go ahead and analyze our\nslides and see if it incorporates these formatting changes. I'll go back to the Slide Master,\nI'll click on Close Master View. And look at that! All of my Level 1 bullet points\nare orange, and it has the hollow squares here as well. If I go back to slide number 2,\nwe can see all of those formatting changes have been applied here. The title, Georgia 40 Blue. Level 1, orange with the hollow squares. Level 2 bullet items, or list items,\npurple with the hollow square as well. So those are some of the universal changes\nthat we can make with the slide master. Now just one more thing to note, I'll\ngo back into the slide master here. So I have two options. What I did initially is\nI chose the master slide. So this applies the formatting\nto every single slide. What if I only wanted\nto make some changes? Let's see if I hover over this one. So this is title and content. It's currently being used\nby slides 2 to 3 and 5 to 7. So if I wanted to format only\nthis particular slide layout, I can do that here as well. So for my third level here,\nI'll go ahead and make this, uh, let's see, I'll make this green. Like that. It's only going to affect the title. my title and content layout. So let's go back here. I'll close the master view. And so this is a, let's see, lesson\none, this is a title and content. Let's add a third level item. And there you go. We can see that it's already, it's already green. If I go to a another layout, let's see,\ndo I have a two content layout in here? Well, let's just insert a\ntwo content layout slide. Okay, so here's level one. Here's level two. And here's level three. So we can see that level three item only\napplies to that particular type of slide. So we can either make universal\nchanges to the entire presentation or to specific slides as well. Go ahead and make some simple\nchanges in the slide master. Thank you. and preview it and come right back. Let's continue fun with the slide master. Well, what I want to do now is\ncreate a custom slide layout. If I click on new slide here, here are\nthe different layouts that are available based on the current theme that I'm using. Now, I don't have the particular\nlayout that I'm looking for. Basically, what I want is\na three content layout. So I have title and content. I have two content. I want a slide that has three columns. That way I can easily express\nthree concepts or three main keys or three main ideas here. So I don't have one. So what I can do is create my own layout. Let's go ahead and do that. I'll click on the view tab here\nand I'll click on the slide master. Now I have two options. I can either just kind of duplicate an\nexisting slide and just make a basic update or I can insert a new layout. I'll keep it simple. I'll use it based on the\ntwo content layout here. So in the slide master, I'll\nclick on the two content layout. So we have two content\nhere, but I want three. So what I'm going to do is duplicate the\nslide and just resize these placeholders. and place one here in the middle. So I'm going to right click on\nthis layout and I'll choose the duplicate layout option here. I can see it's duplicated. It's the exact replica of the one above. So on the duplicated layout,\nI want to rename it first. So we'll duplicate it, rename it, and\nthen we'll go ahead and format it. So I'll right click on it. I'll choose rename. I can also click right here to rename it. I'll right click. I'll rename. I'll call this one three content. I'll press rename and I'm good to go. So now what I can do, I can\njust go ahead and resize these. So I'll go ahead and grab the\ncontent placeholder on the left here and just going to resize it. I do have the footers down here\non the bottom, so I'll make sure it's the same width as my footers. The one on the right, I'll grab the\nresize handle and I'll snap it to that footer on the bottom right here. Now I have space in the\nmiddle to put a, a bigger one. I could resize them, make them all\nthe same size if I want to, but I'll just insert one here in the middle. So to do that, I'll click on\nwhere it says Insert Placeholder. So under the Master Layout\ncommand group, under the Slide Master, I'll insert a placeholder. Now here are the different\nplaceholders that we can insert. The content, basically,\nwe can add anything. Text, picture, chart,\ntable, smart art, media. Text is just for text only. picture, chart, table. Well, I want a content placeholder\nthat can pretty much add anything. So I'll click on content. And just like a text\nbox, I have to draw it. So I'll go ahead and draw it here. We can always resize it later. Right now, I just want to use those\ntemporary guides to make sure they're the same height as the other two. And I'll snap this right here. And I think I'd like to\ngo ahead and center align. my title as well. So there we go. Let's go ahead and close the master view. Let's go ahead and insert\nthis slide and let's see what this slide layout looks like. So now how do I find it? If I click on new slide, I can see\nhere is my three content layout. So pretty, pretty cool. So now I can always use this\nslide layout whenever I want to. I'll go ahead and insert that here. And there it is. So I can add my title and I have\nmy content placeholder here on the left, middle and on the right. So pretty, pretty nice as well. Go ahead and create a\nthree content layout. Go ahead and insert it into your\npresentation and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead for lesson two. Let's go ahead and create a custom slide\nthat we can use over and over again. I'm going to head on\nover to my title slide. Now I did insert a\nimage on my title slide. The reason I do that is because I want\nto gain some insights from the designer. So the designer really likes pictures. So if you add an image to your slide,\nit'll get some more vibrant looking. options here as well. I'm not going to insert any of them. I just want to get some insights\nin terms of what is modern and what looks pretty cool. So we can see it tends to put either a\nbig picture left, big picture right, or even a big picture on the top, and then\nadd our title and subtitle here as well. So these look pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and\ncreate an actual slide. Let's see, see more designs. Now we can see if we actually break\ndown this particular slide here. So how can we recreate a slide like this? This slide, basically we have a picture. We have what looks like a, either\na shape or a text box here. We have a triangle\nshape down here as well. That's pretty much what these are. They're a combination of\ncontent placeholders, images, and different types of shapes. Now, when you create a custom\nslide in the Slide Master, when you actually insert that slide, you will\nnot be able to interact with the picture or any of the other elements. objects that you insert on there. Let's go ahead and head on\nover to the slide master. I'll close the designer here. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to slide master. Now, what I want to do is I want\nto go ahead and insert a layout. If I hover over that tells\nme that I can add a custom layout to the master slide set. Once it's created, I can easily\nadd slides that match the new layout to my presentation. Well, I'll go ahead and\nclick on Insert Layout here. And we can see that it\ninserted a new layout for us. All it has on here is just the title. It's blank. We have the, the footers\ndown here as well. Date, custom message,\nand page number in here. I'm going to rename this right away. Again, I want this to be a\ncustom title slide that I can reuse over and over again. So I'll right click on here\nand I'll rename this layout and I'll call this one title two. And there we go. So I'm going to I think what I will\nwant is a big picture on the top and then I want my title on the\nbottom right and then my subtitle. Maybe I'll go ahead and add\na logo over here as well. So that's what I'll do. So to do that, I'll go ahead\nand click on the insert tab. I'll look for a stock image, and I\nwant something related to learning. I know exactly the picture\nI want, so I'll scroll down. Here it is. Nice chalkboard here. Beautiful colors that are in here. I'll go ahead and insert that one. You can insert any picture you want. So this picture is\nactually very, very good. It actually takes up the entire slide. Sometimes you insert a picture and\nit's more fit to either align it to the left or to align it to the top. So I do want to, what I'm going\nto do is crop this picture because I don't have any space down here. I do not want to overlay the text on it. So I'm going to cut out the picture. I don't want to cut\nout the chairs, though. They look really nice. I'll cut out, maybe I'll crop\nthe bottom and just a little bit from the top here as well. That will give me a little bit of\nroom to be able to add my title, subtitle and my logo as well. So I'll click on the picture format and\nI'll click on the cropping tool here. There we go. And I'll crop it from\nthe bottom to about here. And I'll come down to about here. I'll click away from it. There we go. I'll move it up to the top here. Now that's pretty good. I could probably even crop it a little\nmore, but I'll keep it simple here. Now I want to go ahead and find my title. So my title is hiding behind my pictures. If I move my picture,\nI'll see my title there. So what I'll do is turn\non the selection pane. I can click on Picture Format\nand turn on the Selection Pane. I also have it under my Designs here,\nso I'll just turn on the Selection Pane. I'll go ahead and locate my title. And once I have it selected,\nI can use the arrow keys on my keyboard to just move it down. I can also just bring it forward. If I want to. But for now, I'll just go ahead and\nmove it down here to the bottom. I do want to align it to the right,\nso I'll bring it to the right here. Doesn't need to be that big either. Maybe I'll go to about\nthe middle of the slide. And as far as the text, I'll make that 32. And I'll also Bring it up here as well. I'm going to turn off my footers. So if I go back to the Slide Master,\nI can toggle the footers off here. I'm just going to turn them off for now. I don't really need them right now. But that's pretty much how you would\ninsert footers from the Slide Master. So here we go. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert another placeholder. This will be for my subtitle. So I want a text placeholder. I'll draw it down here. This is going to be just a level one item. So I'll delete all of\nthe other levels here. And this is not a bulleted list. I'll use my quick toolbar\nhere to remove the bullets. And as far as the text, I want to pick up\none of the colors from the picture here. So I'll use the eyedropper. And I'll pull on the color here as well. So I'm good to go. That looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and align\nthis a little more. Alright. Now I'll go ahead and insert\na I'll insert an icon. Something to do with I'll go ahead and grab this one. So this is another type of object. And this one is giving me issues as well. So I'll click on the graphic. I'll use my arrow keys to\nkind of move that around here. And maybe what I'll do\nis align that to the To the bottom, and then to the left here. I'm good to go. If I wanted to do something else, like\nadd a little accent, I can do that. So, I'll just insert a shape to\nkind of show what that looks like. I'll, um, put a little, let's see. Let me just a line. I'll draw a line right through here. There we go. All right, that looks pretty good. I'm going to go ahead and\nclose these, the slide master. And let's go ahead and insert that. So I'll click on new slide. And here's my title two. If I insert that, that's\nwhat it looks like. And it looks pretty good. So if I wanted to make any\nchanges, I can simply go back into the slide master, click on\nthis slide and move things around. But here I can go ahead and add My\ncontent and I'll say community day. I'll say something like learn with us as well. Notice I cannot interact with the icon\nhere or that line shape or that picture. The only things I can interact\nwith are the content placeholders. So when you're designing, if you add\nany shapes or images or any objects that remain flat on the canvas. which makes it possible for us to create\nthese types of designs here as well. Go ahead and create a custom title,\nmake any changes if you need to. For example, if I wanted to go ahead\nand go back to the slide master. So if I wanted to maybe\nalign my text to the right, and once I close the master view\nand go back, I can see now it's aligned to the right as well. Go ahead and insert a\ncustom title, slide or two. Go ahead and insert it\nand come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number three, customizing design templates. Now, when you're creating a template\nin PowerPoint, typically you're saving a couple of slide layouts. You're also creating and saving\na theme and a design as well. We want to go ahead and lock in the\nlayouts that we've created so far. So, if we click on new slide, Here's\nour title, our custom title slide, and here's our three content layout as well. But what if we wanted to make some other\nchanges, such as change the color scheme that's available, and maybe change\nthe font for the entire presentation? I did apply the Georgia\nfont to all of my titles. We can see it's Georgia. But for everything else, it's the default. font style here for PowerPoint. So what I'm going to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and create my own theme by choosing my own colors and fonts. And then we'll go ahead and\nsave this as a template. I'll head on over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab,\ngo back to slide master. So at this point, what I want\nto do, I want to go ahead. I can either choose a theme\nSo let's preview those first. If I click here and I simply choose one\nof these themes, I can see how the theme will update all of my slides for me. But what if I'm not finding\na theme that I want? What if I want to use my\nown colors and my own fonts? Typically, that's what we\nwill do in the slide master. I'll click on the colors here,\nand you can see I have some different pals to choose from. So depending, maybe I'm trying\nto brand this presentation and I want a particular color set. I can go ahead and choose one of\nthese existing ones here as well. Additionally, if I want to, I\ncan even take it a step further. I can create my own color palette. The way to do that is by\nclicking on customize colors. Once you're here, we just need to go\nahead and name it and go ahead and choose all these colors that we want. So this is typically where you\nwould put your company colors to be able to brand the presentation. Once you do that, it will\nappear in the custom area. And as you can see, I have a\ncouple of color palettes here. Okay. Right now, just want to\nchoose an existing palette. And I'm going to go ahead and I'll\nchoose, I'll go with the blue two. So I've chosen my color set. Now, every time I want to\nmodify something, I'll see that those colors are now available. I want to choose my own font as well. So I'll go ahead and click on fonts. And I want to use the Georgia\nfont, not just for this particular slide, but all of my slides. So I'll scroll down to, I don't\nhave Georgia here, I'll click here. And we can see everything now is Georgia. If I go back to my slide master here,\nI can see it's Georgia here as well. So basically I chose my own color palette. I chose my own font. If I want to, I can even add a, an effect. I'll go for a glossy effect. These effects, they're very subtle. They appear in things like charts and\ntables and other types of visuals. Not really for text here as well. So that's it. So from here, what I can do is\nI can go ahead and lock all this in by saving this as a template. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go ahead and\nclick on the file tab. Then I'll go ahead and click on save as, and I can do it there if I want to, or\nI can press the F12 key on my keyboard. Now once I'm here, what I need to do\nis simply change the presentation type. So I want to save the type. Not as a PowerPoint presentation,\nbut as a PowerPoint template. So I'll click on this drop down first. I'll scroll down to PowerPoint template. Here it is. Now notice when I change this to a\ntemplate save type, it automatically jumps to the folder, the default\nfolder that houses all of my custom office templates here as well. So we don't want to change that location. The only thing we want to do is go\nahead and rename it and press save. So I'll go ahead and\nleave this as the name. I'll press save. And that's it. So this has been saved as a template. The next time I open PowerPoint,\nright from my start screen, I can see that template. And now I'll have all of the colors,\nfonts, effects, slide layouts, custom slides, any changes that I've made\nwill be locked into the template. I'm going to go ahead and\nclose the master view. Then the next thing to do is to\nbe able to find our templates. I'll click on the file tab here and you'll\nnotice it appears right here on your recent files from the home button there. So what I like to do is that I like\nto go ahead and pin it right away. So it will always show up on my pin files. I'll go ahead and pin that. There we go. So now it's pinned. If I click on my pin files,\nI can see it in here. It's right here. So I can always access that file. The traditional way to access your\ntemplates is to click on the new tab here. And when you go down, we'll notice\nthat we have office templates. So this is from Microsoft's gallery. We want custom. So if I have existing templates, click\non the new tab, click on custom, and then I'll have my custom office templates. If I click right here, Here\nare the different templates. Here's the recent one that I created. And basically the way that this\nworks is, if I were to open this file, PowerPoint will produce a\ncopy of that presentation for me. The original template will\nremain untouched here as well. So that's the benefit of\nworking with a template. We can reuse it over\nand over and over again. If we want to make any changes to the\ntemplate, we can go ahead and open it from the folder structure on our computer. And make any changes and re\nsave it and that template will be updated here as well. So go ahead and go back\ninto the Slide Master. Go ahead and choose a color scheme. Choose a font. Go ahead and save your presentation as\na template and just confirm that you can see it in your custom templates folder. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move on to\nlesson four, creating infographics. We're going to create smart art, and then\nwe will go ahead and modify smart art. And once we're finished, we'll Have the\ncapability to animate smart art as well. Now, what exactly is smart art? Smart art is a way of creating\ninfographics in Microsoft PowerPoint, so really there's no need to\nsearch the web for an infographic. We have an extensive library in\nPowerPoint that you can use to create your own infographics. We want to get to this library of\nsmart art graphics that we can create. We can see that we have different. Sections such as if you want to\nexpress an infographic as a list, a process, a cycle, so forth and so on. What we'll talk about is how we can\nconvert smart art from existing content, and we'll also take a look at how we can\ngo ahead and insert a smart art graphic and then add our own content to it. So an infographic is basically text. accompanied by either shapes or images. So in this example, I have a basic\nlist here, just step one, step two, and step three, very generic. We're going to convert this\ninto an infographic and we'll watch it evolve as we do that. So I can either express my steps\nhere in the form of a bulleted list as such, or what I can do, I'm going\nto go ahead and highlight my list. And then I'll use Microsoft to\nconvert this into an infographic. To do that, I need to first highlight\nmy My list, and on the home tab, in the paragraph command group here is smart art. If you hover over it tells you exactly\nwhat it does, converts text on your slide to a smart art graphic, such as a\ndiagram, flow chart, so forth and so on. If I click on the dropdown,\nI see just a short list. of infographics that I can create. For example, here's the first\none, a vertical bullet list. So as you can see, if I were to\nchoose this one, I'll get those really nice rounded rectangle\nshapes there to accompany my text. Here's another type, vertical block list. So we have smaller rounded rectangles. And if we wanted to add a picture to it,\nwe can go ahead and do that here as well. So lots of different. Graphics in here. It's time to explore and\nsee what is a available. Some of these are different. Here's an org chart. So if you want to create an\norganization chart, you can pretty much do that in PowerPoint. Here's another variation hierarchy. So we can express something as\na list, a hierarchy, a process. Cycle. So, lots of different\noptions that we can use here. We're going to go ahead and\nclick on more smart art graphics. Let's take a look at the library to\nget an understanding of what we can do. So, here's the full smart art library. And basically, PowerPoint is asking\nus to choose a smart art graphic. Well, we can choose whether we want to\nexpress something as a list, something as a cycle, or even as a matrix. So different ones here. When you click on the list. So in this case, I want to\nexpress something as a process. Step one, two, three. I have a basic process here. Here's a preview of what\nthis would look like. On the bottom, we have a brief explanation\nof how the SmartArt graphic works. Here's the second one, a step up process. We have a step down process here as well. Now when you're creating an\ninfographic, you can keep it very simple or you can make it more complex. So as we can see down here,\nwe have some more complex. infographics or smart art. And we can see that we have a more in\ndepth explanation of how this works. It's all based on levels. So when you're creating a list, it's all\nbased on level one, two, or three items. So different smart art graphics\nwill incorporate different levels. Some, some only allow one or two,\nsome will allow more than two as well. For, for relations, we can see\nwe have some really complex ones in here, such as a balance scale. And we have a lot of verbiage here,\nkind of explaining how that works. So what I'd like for you to do,\ngo ahead and highlight your text. And then go ahead and try out\nsome of the different smart arts. We can always change\nit once we select one. So if I select the vertical\nbullet list here, I can always change it a little later. So go ahead and check them out. If you're feeling adventurous, click\non the more smart art graphics here and take a look at the different options\nthat are available and come right back. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and create\nan infographic here. I'm going to go ahead and highlight\nmy text and go into, I'll start with a vertical bullet list here. Now, when you start with your smart\nart graphic, you'll notice that we have a smart art design contextual tab. So just like all of the other\nobjects, we can change the layout. We can change the style. So as you can see, we\nhave a white outline. We have a glossy effect\nhere, a shadowy effect. So there's a lot of different\nthings that we can do here. We can change the colors. And over here on the far left\nis where we can basically control our smart art graphics. So if we wanted to add another\nshape or move things around, we can do that as well. But I want to introduce you to our\nlittle text pane here on the left. And basically this is how I prefer\nto manage my smart art graphic. So again, it's based on the levels here. I only have level one items in here. If you're not seeing this text pane,\njust make sure to go ahead and click on this little arrow here, and this\nwill open up the text pane for you. So I'll click here, and there we go. If I wanted to do something like add\nanother step, I can just add another bullet there, and as you can see, it's\nalready adding that fourth shape for me. So if I say step four, I can do that as well. Now, if I continue working with the\nlist, if I press the enter key after step one, and I press tab over,\nso now I have a level two item. The level two item has its own\nNot really a shape, but just a small area here that we can use. So I'm going to keep it simple. I'm going to remove step 4. So I'll delete step 4 from my list. You'll notice the shape goes away. And for step 1, I'm just going\nto go ahead and put a level 2 item for each of my steps here. I'll keep it simple here. And as a matter of fact, if I\nalready had a bulleted list, I can copy and paste it in here. If I wanted to, and that will\nactually create the smart art graphic for me as well. But for here, I'll keep it simple. I'll just go with a Project\nmanagement template here. So I'll define the project\nStep two, I'll tab over and I'll say identify stakeholders. And for step number three,\nwe'll go ahead and add tasks. So that's how the smart art graphic works. So we have three here. So that's the simple way\nthat we can modify it. Now what I can do if you want to move\nthings around, well, what you can do is click on one of the shapes here and\non the smart art design tab over here on the far left, this is where we can\ndo things like move this down on the list, or we can move it up, or we can\npromote or demote, or we can add a shape. So we can either manage the list here\nto manage the smart art, Or we can use the create graphic command group\nto manage the smart art as well. So for example, if I wanted to move step\none down, notice how it moves the level one and the level two item down as well. I can go ahead and move that back up. And maybe I want to promote define\nproject as a level one item. So it does it here. And it gives, gives its own shape as well. I'll go ahead and demote that. And I'm good to go. So that's the basics of how we use\nthe text pane to modify SmartArt. Now, let's take a look\nat something else here. Let's click on the SmartArt design tab. And what if I want to change the colors? I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll click on the color palette here. And we have three options for the\nprimary colors based on the theme that we currently have selected. Just get the preview,\nsee what that looks like. We have five colorful\npalettes to choose from. So these are all incorporating\nthe accent colors based on the theme that you have selected. If I scroll down, we have different\nvariations of each accent color. So it's really up to you\nwhat you want to use. I typically like to use the\ncolorful scheme here as well. Once we change the colors, we can\nhead on over to smart art styles. And as you can see, there's a\nfew styles to choose from here. The first one gives a white outline\nand a little shadow as well. So it makes it look pretty nice. And then we have a subtle effect. Here's the moderate effect. And it gets more intense\nas we go to the right. So this one has a gloss\nand it also has a shadow. And we have polished. And it gets a little more interesting\nas we go through here as well. So different orientations\nof the SmartArt graphic. I'll go back. I'll just choose the\nmoderate effect here as well. So that is how we insert\nand modify SmartArt. Go ahead and create your own\nSmartArt graphic and come right back. In our last lesson, we saw how\nwe can create an infographic from existing content. Let's go ahead and move\non to the next slide. And this time we'll go ahead and insert\nSmartArt and then add our content. Now I can click on the SmartArt right\nhere inside of my content placeholder. That will insert my SmartArt for me. I can also click on the insert tab. And in the illustrations command group,\nhere's the smart art here as well. I'll go ahead and click on the\ninsert a smart art graphic right from my content placeholder. And again, here's the entire library\nof what we can go ahead and insert. I want to express something as a process. So, lots of different processes\nhere that I can, I can use. We can integrate pictures. in there as well. We'll get to pictures\nin just a little bit. Let's go ahead and keep it simple. I'll go ahead and insert\na step up process. I'll go ahead and press okay. So here's the shell of our smart art. Again, we have the smart art\ncontextual tab and over here we have our little text pane. Now what I can do, I can either\ntype the information in here or I already have the information I want. I'll go back to my other slide. I'll open up the text pane for this\nSmartArt graphic, and I'll just copy and paste this list right into here. So if you ever, if you already\nhave an existing list, you can simply copy and paste it in here. What I want to do first, though, is\npress CTRL A inside of my text pane here, and delete everything first, because\nif I paste it in, it's going to just append that to the existing SmartArt. So I'll go ahead and right click and I'll\ngo ahead and use the destination theme. And there is my SmartArt graphic. So all my levels are intact here as well. So that looks pretty good. But what if I want to go ahead and change\nthe SmartArt graphic to something else? I'll go ahead and click on the\nSmartArt design tab here and right over here under layouts. I'll get some similar layouts\nthat I can choose from. So I'll go ahead and maybe\nchoose this first one here. Here's the step down process. That's what that would look like. Here's the accent process. That looks pretty good as well. And here's the picture accent process. So this actually incorporates pictures. I'll go ahead and click on this one. And so now we're given another\nshape with a picture placeholder. So I'm going to go ahead\nand take it a step further. I'll use three images that kind of\ncommunicate, defining the project, identifying and tasks here as well. So to do that, I'll go ahead and\nclick on the placeholder either here or on my text pane here. Doesn't matter. I'll go ahead and click here. And I can either insert in a\npicture or I can use an icon. I prefer to use an icon because\nthey're always the same size, one inch by one inch pictures. We may need to crop the pictures to make\nthem fit inside of our smart art graphic. So I'll go ahead and grab an icon here. Here's my icon library. So I want something that\nrepresents defining. or yes, defining the project. So I'll search for, let's see targets. There you go. Like this graphic. I'll go ahead and choose this one. I'll choose the fill colored\none as opposed to the outline. So I'll go ahead and choose this here. Here's my graphic behind\nit for the next one. I'll look for a search icon, search or find And because we want to\ngo ahead and identify the stakeholders. So maybe I'll, maybe I'll use this one. A little hard to see it. Maybe I'll change that. And the last one should\nbe pretty simple to find. I'll just type tasks. I'll get a couple of\ntask lists here as well. I'll go for, I'll go for this one. That looks okay. Go ahead and insert that. So here are my three icons. I think I'm going to go ahead\nand change my second icon here. There we go. I'll have to first select it. Now I can right click on it and I\ncan change the graphic from icons. And I'll type find. Probably going to have the same issue. There we go. You know what? Let's see. Community. There we go. Maybe I'll go with this one. Identify stakeholders. And there we go. So that's how we can change the\nSmartArt graphic to another layout. And this is how we can integrate\npictures in here as well. Now, I want to make this look\na little nicer, so I'll go ahead and change the colors. I'll give it a colorful,\na colorful palette here. There we go. So that looks pretty nice. Now I can, if I wanted to, I can make\nchanges to the individual objects here. So the arrow, all of these,\nI can go ahead and change. So if I wanted to go ahead and\nchange the color of this icon, notice that we have the graphics\nformat tab here that's available. And if I wanted to do that,\nI can simply go ahead and recolor it by applying a style. or giving it a different,\ndifferent graphic fill color. If I wanted to here, if I\nwanted a standard color, I can go ahead and do that as well. So that's what we can do. So we can change the color. We can have smart art, just kind\nof update the colors for us. I'll go ahead and give this a,\nI'll give this a white outline. That looks pretty nice. And now The beauty of this is once\nI have my smart art, if I want to go ahead and change, I can. So if I wanted to change this\ngraphic, it's a matter of just hovering over the different ones\nand see which one I like here. That looks pretty nice as well. Sometimes the, when you add a\npicture and you change the smart art, Any type of arrows will show\nup in the form of that picture. It's not really happening\nhere, but so pretty nice. Let's see. Are there any other picture of ones here? Here's another picture. So this is a ascending picture process. So there we go. Now, if I wanted to I can go ahead\nand just click on more layouts. This looks pretty nice. This gear icon here as well. I'll go ahead and click on more\nlayouts and I'll look for some of the other smart art graphics that\nare available in the picture command group and I'll take a look at those. So here's a another type here. I don't really like that. Not all these will work because\nagain some of them have their own type of requirements and they only\nallow certain amount of levels. So, it's just a matter of once you\nincorporate those pictures, choose the layout that you like and we're good to go. I'll go ahead and stick with this one and maybe I'll change\nthe colors here as well. And there we go. So, go ahead and insert your smart art. Go ahead and insert some\nicons or even some images. See what they look like\nand come right back. Welcome to Module 4. For Module 4, we'll go ahead and explore\nworking with media and animations. Video. Collaborating on a presentation. We'll customize our slideshow behavior. So what are some of the things\nthat we can kind of establish before we run our slideshow? And then we'll wrap up by using some of\nthe newer tools to automate animation. a slideshow. Go ahead and open up the module 4\npractice file and come right back. We'll dive right into module 4. Here's my module 4 practice file. I'll jump into slide number\n2, which is lesson 5. So for lesson 5, it's all\nabout working with media. We'll go ahead and insert\na local video file. And then we'll insert an\nonline video here as well. To insert media, we want to get\nto this media command group that can be found on the insert tab. And over here, we can insert videos\nfrom our device from the stock library. Also online videos, we'll take a\nlook at the different sources that we're able to stream videos from. When it comes to audio, you can either\nrecord your own audio, Using your microphone, or you can go ahead and upload\na audio file from your computer as well. And we also have the screen\nrecording tool, which we'll take a look at just a little bit here. I want to take advantage of the\ncontent placeholder here, and I'll insert my video by clicking on the\ninsert video content placeholder. So this allows me to basically upload\na video from my computer locally. So I'll go ahead and\ninsert this video here. And here is my video. Now, once we insert the\nvideo, we can resize it. It's an object, just like all of the other\nobjects that we've been interacting with. So as expected, we have a contextual tab. We actually have two. One is for video format\nand one is for playback. Well, if I click on video format, I can\ndo things like You know, choose a quick style, I can place it in an oval if I want\nto, or maybe give it a nice reflection. A simple shadow or just a\nsimple frame here as well. So I can do any of those things. Well, I want to go ahead and\njust run this slide and let's see what this actually looks like. So I'll go ahead and I'll\nrun this in reading mode. And I'll go ahead and play my video. So as we can see I can have some\nbasic controls here such as I can play it I can skim through it and I can\nalso adjust the Volume here as well. So this is kind of the\ndefault out of the box. Let's go ahead and make some\nFormatting changes to it here as well. I'll press escape come back here So\nif I click on here, remember the first thing I'll do I'll click on video format\nI'll go ahead and put this in a frame. Maybe I'll put it in a Go for this Rounded rectangle here. So put it in that frame. I can make it bigger if I want to as well. So I've placed it in a frame. And over here, I can go ahead\nand play it to get a nice preview of what it would look like. Just like with our image tools,\nI can go ahead and give it some corrections, make it brighter,\nor have more contrast as well. I can even recolor it if I want to. And we have some other pretty nice\ntools here as well, but that's about it for the video format. I just want to give it a quick style. I'll go to the playback here, and when\nwe click on the playback contextual tab, we can see that we have some editing\ntools here that we can use, such as trimming the video, fading in and out. And then we have some\nother video options here. This will basically establish how the\nvideo behaves once we get to the slide. Let's take a look at\nthe Trim Video feature. I'll click on Trim Video. And in this particular video, there was\na lot of white space in the beginning. So maybe I don't want to start. Maybe I want to start\nmaybe right about here. I'll start with that question. What brought you to LearnIt today? So maybe right about there. Right, so just by moving that\nslider, I'm starting at 14. 9 seconds here as well. At the end, I had a little,\nsome more space in here as well. Maybe I'll stop right here as\nsoon as the LearnIt logo appears. That's it. I can even use these little\narrows to kind of determine. the starting point. That helps a little better. I'll go ahead and press okay. And let's preview it. There you go. So it started with the question\nas opposed to starting from the very beginning there as well. All right. So I already trimmed the video. I'll go ahead and establish the volume. I'll make sure that the volume is medium. I don't want it to be\nhigh for my audience. And I want it to play automatically. So whenever I navigate to the slide, This\nwill play automatically here as well, and I want to play it in full screen mode. So I can go ahead and do\nthat, and I'm good to go. So let's go ahead and\nrun this in reading view. Let's see what this looks like. So there you go. So we can see that the volume has been set\nto medium, and it's playing in full screen here, and it also played automatically. So I'll go ahead and escape and\ngo back to my slide here as well. So go ahead and insert a video. Hopefully you have one. Go ahead and insert it. Take a look at the different\ntools under the video format tab and go ahead and trim the video. Make it start automatically and\nalso go ahead and play it full screen and come right back. In this segment, we'll go\nahead and insert online video. Now I'm actually going\nto insert a new slide. So I'll just press control\nM and start a new slide. I'll change this layout to title only. Because I want to insert a nice big\nonline video here from our YouTube site. So this will be an online video. So to insert an online video, if I click\non the insert tab, and here is video. So I have the option to insert video\nfrom the online stock videos, or I can grab from various sources here as well. I'll click on online videos, and\nwe'll kind of just preview what's available in the stock video library. I'll click on online videos here. And we're given some information. So these are the different sources\nthat we can stream video from. So YouTube, SlideShare,\nVimeo, Stream, and Flip. So we basically need to grab\nthe address or the URL of that video and paste it in here. Once we paste it in here, we'll get\na nice preview of the video, just ensuring that we have the correct one. So I'm going to go ahead and jump\nover to our YouTube page with the video that I want to stream here. Here we go. So this is the video. We'll go ahead and play this here. Okay. So to grab the video address,\nI can just right click here. And I'll copy the video URL. Once that's on my clipboard here,\nI'll head back over to my PowerPoint. So right here, I'll go\nahead and paste the video. So I can, you can right click and paste\nthe video in there, or you can press control V and we can see it shows up here. So here's my little tutorial\non Microsoft 365 basics. We can preview the video right here. And there we go. So even though it's an hour and 26\nminutes long, we're streaming it. So as long as you have an internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. This is not being stored in our\nPowerPoint, so it's not taking up space as is the video that\nwe uploaded from our computer. I'll go ahead and click on insert. And here is my video. So I can either have it take up\nthe entire slide like that, or I can go ahead and resize it. If I click on the video format,\nI can still do things, like I can correct it, I can recolor it if I want to. I can even go ahead and\nplace it in a frame. So maybe I want to place\nit in a frame like this. I can do that, or a simple frame. Um, Now, if I click on the playback\ntab here, I noticed that these options over here, they're grayed out. So, none of the editing controls. The only thing I can do really is to decide whether I want this to play\nin sequence, meaning I have to click on it, or if I want it to\nplay automatically here as well. I'll go ahead and choose automatically. So we don't have all the tools because\nwe don't really, you know, this is, this video is being streamed. We don't own the video, so we\ncannot edit it here as well. I'll go ahead and click\non my reading view here. Let's see what this looks like. There we go. So we can kind of fast forward. So depending on your internet\nconnection, you should be good to go. All right, I'll go ahead\nand press escape here. I'll press escape again\nto go back to my slide. So that is how we insert an online video\nfrom those different sources as well. Again, we can play it. It works well right from the stream. We just don't have all of the resources. normal bells and whistles that we\nhave if we actually own the video. I'm going to go ahead and delete this. I'll just press the delete\nkey to get rid of it. Now let's just take a look\nat the stock of online video. I'll click on the insert tab. I'll go back over to video and let's take\na look at some of the stock videos here. So these are not really long videos. They're pretty short, maybe in the\nrange of 9 to 15 seconds and Let's see, I'll go ahead and grab this one here. I'll go ahead and insert this. So it took up the entire slide, but\nagain, you can always resize it. We can, just like with our other\nobjects, we can resize them. I'm okay with it taking up\nthe entire slide though. That's perfectly fine. So I can go ahead and play it here. And this is going to be about\nnine seconds, just a little over nine seconds here as well. So if I were to preview this,\nI'll go on reading mode. So there you go. Pretty cool. I'll press the escape key and let's\nsee what options we have available. So this is from the stock, so we can still\ndo the same things with the video format. We can place it in a frame if we want to. Maybe I'll put it in a frame like that. We have the corrections\nthat we can use as well. And as far as playback, because\nthis is from the stock, we do have the capability to trim the video. So we can actually trim\nthe video if we want to. We can specify when it\nstarts, when it ends. We can also opt to play it full screen. So all of the other options\nthat we have there are pretty much good to go here as well. Now, one of the things is the, we have\nwhat's called a poster frame and this allows us to basically put a poster on\nthe first, first glance at the video here. So if I wanted to maybe show this part, I\ncan go ahead and click on poster frame and I'll say this will be the poster frame. Starting frame for my actual video here. You can also go ahead and insert an image. So if you wanted to insert an image\nfrom file, that's basically what you'll see before you actually play the video. So if I click play here, there we go. So that's what it's all\nabout inserting videos. into your PowerPoint presentation,\neither the stock library, online sources, or a video locally from your device. The screen recording is a\nreally nice tool in PowerPoint. Many of us are not aware that we\ncan actually record our screen. No need to buy an expensive program. We have one built in right here. After we record our screen, it\nwill insert the recording right onto our slide for us here as well. So if I click on screen recording, it's\ngoing to minimize my PowerPoint window. Whatever is in the background will\nbe brought to the front here as well. I'll click on screen recording. Let's take a look at the what's available. So as you can see, when we're recording\nthe screen, we can select the area. of our screen that we want to record. Mine is already pre selected. If you want to record your audio,\nyour voice via your microphone, you can go ahead and turn on the audio. And if you want to record\nyour mouse pointer, you can go ahead and record that as well. I'll record my audio. I'll record my pointer here as well. And I'll go ahead and select my area. But first, what I want to do is I'm going\nto go ahead and just kind of resize my, my window here for Microsoft Edge. And I'm going to bring it down. One of the things that happens\nwith a screen recorder, this little toolbar here gets in the way\nsometimes when you're recording. So I want to make sure that my. Recording area is below that box. So I'll go ahead and reselect my area. I'll just draw a box around\nmy Microsoft Edge window here. Like that. And there we go. So, what you can do, if you want to\nrecord your entire screen, when you want to stop or pause your recording,\nyou can use the shortcut key. So, Windows logo, shift plus Q, that\nwill stop the recording for you, this way you don't have to go back to\nthe top of your screen, expose this little toolbar here, and click on stop\nrecording, because that will show up on your recording, at least the last\ntime I did it, that's what happened. I'll go ahead and click on record, I'll\nget a countdown, I'll get a quick reminder of shortcut is to stop the recording. Let's go ahead and do that. So in this case, I'll just demonstrate\nhow to sign up for a course at learnit. com. Let's get started on how to\nsign up for a course at learnit. com. Let's first go to www. learnit. com. Once we're here, we can either\ngo ahead and sign in or register. Or if you want to go ahead and view\nall classes, we can click here. Once we're here, we can search for a\nclass of interest, or we can scroll down to see our upcoming courses here as well. Here's an Excel introduction course. I'll go ahead and click on here. So it gives me the details, what will be\ncovered, and it also shows the upcoming schedule for these classes as well. Maybe I'll go ahead and take a little\nbreak, and then in February, I want to go ahead and take this course. So I'll click on my little plus\nicon here to add this to the cart. And I'll remove the other one. I'll go to checkout. And from here, I simply just need to\ngo ahead and click on the next step and continue the login, registration,\npayment, and confirmation process. And I am good to go. And that's all to it. So there we go. I was able to do a, just\na small recording there. About a minute and 15 seconds. You can see it inserts the recording\nfor us right here onto the slide. Again, we can resize this if we want to. Doesn't necessarily have to\ntake up the entire screen. Maybe what I'll do is I'll\njust go ahead and center it. Kind of align things a little\nbetter here on the slide. There we go. And so we can go ahead and play it. And as we can see, of course, my\nvoice records, my, my cursor as well. So really, really nice tool. Now because we inserted this screen\nrecording, we have all of the tools of the editing tools, right? So if we wanted to trim the, the\nvideo, we can kind of preview it, make sure everything looks good. If it doesn't, we can always go\nahead and just trim different parts of the video here as well. We have all of the other tools that we can\ngo ahead and use, as we mentioned before. If you have offline captions, you\ncan go ahead and insert captions for the, um, for the video as well. So it's a really nice tool,\nreally nice tool to use as a learning or as a help aid. So a really nice option here as well. Go ahead and take advantage\nof the screen recording tool. Go ahead and upload one or two. The good thing is once we're done,\nwe can go ahead and save this. So if you make any changes to it on\nthe playback tab, we can click on save media as you can do the same\nthing by right clicking on the video and clicking on save media as we can\nsave it as media file or we can even save it as a picture here as well. So we can save it as a picture. We can save the media as a media file. So pretty cool. Go ahead and play around with the screen\nrecording tool and come right back. Welcome back. And let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number six. So we'll talk about collaborating\non a PowerPoint presentation here. So there's a couple of\nthings that we need to do. We first need to go ahead and save. Our presentation to OneDrive. And after we do that, we can go ahead\nand share the presentation and one, once we have uploaded it to either\nOneDrive or SharePoint, we can share it and we can go ahead and view different\nversions of the file here as well. So you can either click on the\nfile tab and click on save As. Go ahead and save it to one\nof your OneDrive spaces. Or if you have the share\nicon here, click on share. It's going to first ask you to\ngo ahead and upload it to your OneDrive and then you can share it. I'll go ahead and save it and then\nI'll come back once I have that saved. Now that I have it saved, what I can\ndo is click on the share icon here. So I'll go ahead and click on share. And we get to this dialog box. Now, this dialog box has had some changes\nrecently, looks a little different, but this is the modern version of it here. So what I can do is I first need\nto decide, well who do I want to share this document with, how do\nI want to share it, and what type of access do I want them to have. So, I can either copy a link, or\nAnd send that link out via email or by Teams chat or any other medium. And anyone that has that link,\nthey can either edit or they can view the particular file here. Well, this is collaboration. I want to go ahead and send it to\nAdele, who's on my sandbox account. So I'll go ahead and type in Adele here. I'll make sure that Adele can edit to make\nchanges and I'll just say, please edit. And that's pretty much it. Once I go ahead and press\nsend, I'm good to go. If I want more advanced options, I\ncan go ahead and click on the sharing settings here and I'll have some other\noptions, but I have everything I need just on this very first window here. I'm sending this via Outlook\nto Adele, edit access. And I'm going to go\nahead and send it here. All right. So I'll go ahead and close this out. Let's head on over to Adele's mailbox. See if we get that message here. I'll go ahead and refresh. Here it is. So it just came in. This is what the message looks like. A file has been shared with you. Here's the custom message. I'll go ahead and click on open here. And this will open up. online. Now my recipient will have the option\nif they want to open in the desktop app, they can do that as well. But to keep it simple, we'll just open\nthe file here in the web and here we go. So here's the, here's Adele's\nversion of the file and Adele can see that I'm working in here. My avatar appears here\nbecause I'm currently in the file and I'm working on it. If I scroll down, we can see exactly, I'm\ncurrently on this slide for lesson six. Well, that's where we need to go. So I'll go ahead in here\nand I'll add a task. I'll say task two. And the owner here will be Adele. And I'll say that this,\num, has, Not yet started and progress is zero percent. So let's see what that looks like. I'll go back to my desktop copy here. Now we can see the changes\nhave already been made. I can see that Adele is showing up\nas a guest contributor and I can see Adele is right here on slide end. Number five, right? So I'll go ahead and put myself in here. Now we can keep on editing here as well. Alright, so task three\nis going to be Nester. Now what I can do, if I click\non the review tab, I can add comments in here, right? So maybe I want to add a comment regarding\nthe video Task number three, I'll go ahead and put a comment in here and\nI'll say please confirm with Nestor. So this is the whole concept\nbehind collaborating. You can comment in here, we can work on\nthe file together, and we're good to go. Let's go back to the, let's see\nhere, let's click on the review tab. And let's click on show comments. Right. So here, here are the comments\nhere as well that we can see. So that's pretty cool. So we can go ahead and make some changes. I'll go ahead and reply to this and\nI'll say, I will take care of that. Go ahead and post the reply here as well. And so there we go. So it's a matter of saving to\nOneDrive and or SharePoint. sharing the document with edit access\nand being able to mark up the document at the same time here as well. I could even see the\nnotes that are in here. Let's go ahead and take a look at the\ndifferent versions of the document. I'll go back to here. I'll click on the file tab\nand I'll click on info. And now what I can see\nis the version history. It's on the info tab. Here's the version\nhistory of the document. Let's see what versions\nhave been captured so far. I'll click here. And so far, since I uploaded\nit and saved it, I can see that three versions have been saved. Here's the version as of 11. 05, 11. 09, and 11. 11 as well. So what I can do is I can go ahead\nand open a older version here. Let's see what this one looks like. So right now we have three tasks. So this kind of opens up the, that version. So we can see the current\nversion has three tasks. This version only has two tasks in here. So this is pretty helpful because\nsometimes some changes are made that are just too drastic and you want to be\nable to fall back to a prior version. And so the fact that the versions\nare being saved automatically, It's a really, really big help here as well. If I wanted to restore this\nversion, I can click on restore. This would make this the\ncurrent version here as well. But I don't want to do that. I just want to go back to the\nto the other version here. So I'll go ahead and close this out. And it brings me back\nto my updated version. I'll go ahead and close this pane here. And I am good to go. Now what I can do is, let's see, if I go\nover to the file tab, click back on info and I click on protect here. So what I can do is I can mark\nthis as final, but everyone will need to be logged out first. So I can let all of my collaborators\nknow that there's no more changes being made to this document. We're marking it as final here as well. Right now, while we're here, it's\ngood to take a look at these things. We can see the, on the info tab here,\nwe have the media size and performance. We can see that we have 68 megs here. The entire presentation is currently\n71 megs, mostly because of the screen recording and that video\nthat we uploaded earlier as well. I'll go back here. And so that's how you\ncollaborate on a document. For lesson seven, we'll talk about\ncustomizing slideshow behavior. So what we'll discuss is some of the\nthings that we can do before we run our slideshow, and some things that we\ncan do during our slideshow as well. So sometimes you may notice when you're\nrunning your slideshow, your presenter window is either turned off or turned on,\nor it's showing up on the wrong monitor. Well, those are things that we\ncan use to set up a slideshow. To set up a slideshow, let's click on\nthe slideshow tab here and we have an entire section here devoted to setup. Now we can go ahead and click on\nsetup slideshow and it's going to be a combination of all of these\ndifferent things here using time in timings, using the presenter\nview, things like that here as well. So, let's click on setup slideshow and\nwe're presented with this dialog box here. And there's a couple of different areas. So how do we want to run the presentation? By default, when you run\ntheir presentation, it takes up the entire screen. But if you wanted to kind of have\nit run in reading mode, you can choose the second option, right? It just runs in a window. That way, it doesn't take\nup your entire screen. You can resize it. And then if you wanted to just\nkind of loop on maybe a big TV. You can go ahead and use\nthe browse at a kiosk. So it's full screen. You'll notice if you, when you check\nthat option, it's automatically going to loop until you stop the slideshow. So you may walk into a building\nat a corporation, you may see the same slideshow running\nover and over and over again. It's in kiosk mode. Right, I'll go back to presented\nby a speaker full screen. And then over here for show\nslides, you can determine which slides you want to show. You can leave it just for all, or\nwe can say, I only want to show slides one to five, or we can do\nthat or show everything here as well. We don't have any custom shows in here. We'll talk about that\nin just a little bit. If we create some custom shows, we can\nchoose to run the custom show as well. So these things just kind of gives\nyou some, some confidence as you're running your slideshow, because maybe\nyou don't want certain slides to show up on this particular presentation. Now, in terms of advancing slides right\nnow, by default, it's going to use timings, if any timings are present. So we can either adjust the timing for\neach slide, but we're going to go ahead and record the entire presentation. So there's really no need\nto rehearse the timings. Down here, if you're using multiple\nmonitors, you want to make a choice. Do you want to use presenter view? Presenter view is a really nice thing\nto use because while your audience is seeing your presentation, you are\ntaking a look at your presenter view. So you can see what's coming next,\neither a slide or an animation. You also have notes that you can\nuse as talking points as well. So I'm going to go ahead\nand use presenter view. And my slideshow is going to\nrun on my primary monitor. I'll leave that as is for now. I'll go ahead and press OK. And I'll go ahead and\nrun my slideshow here. So here we can see my\nslideshow is running. I'll go ahead and switch the presenter\nview so that it's showing on this monitor. And let's take a look\nat the presenter view. I'll press escape. I'll go back into setup slideshow. And I want my slideshow to\nrun on my internal display. I'll press OK. And now I'll run my presentation. So on my other screen, I have the\nslideshow, but here's the presenter view. And as you can see, it's\npretty nice because we have any notes that we have in here. We can see what's coming up next. So this is our next slide,\nlesson number eight. And right here, I can just kind\nof navigate through my slides. If I have any animations, I can\nsee what's coming up next as well. And so pretty nice. What I can also do if I want to\njump to a slide, I can open up my see all slides pane right here. Now my audience will not see\nthis, only I can see this. They're still seeing the current slide. So if I wanted to navigate to\nthis slide, if I click on it, now that is being displayed on\nmy audience screen here as well. Other things I can do, I can go\nahead and turn on the pen and laser and pointer tools, right? So I can go ahead and just\nkind of use those here as well. We'll talk about these\nin just a little bit. And if I wanted to go ahead\nand toggle my camera, I can go ahead and turn on my camera. I can turn on the subtitles right here. So a lot of things we can do\nright from the presenter window. So if I toggle the subtitles,\nnow it's going to be writing. Whatever I'm saying here. I'll go ahead and turn that off. Then we have some other\ntools here as well. If you wanted to hide the presenter\nview, you can go ahead and do that. But we're good to go. I'll go ahead and end\nthe slideshow from here. And those are just some of the basics\nwhen it comes to setting up a slideshow. I'll go back down to lesson number 7 here. And let's go ahead and\ncreate a custom slideshow. So over here on the slideshow tab,\num, we have the custom show in the start slideshow command group, right? If I click on this dropdown here,\nI don't have any custom shows. I'll go ahead and click here. So I want to create a new custom show. Well, why would you want\nto create a custom show? Maybe you just have one really\nlong, you know, slide deck. You may have 30 slides. but maybe you divide that slide, that\nslide deck into three different sections. So instead of showing all 30 slides, you\nmaybe just want to show the first 10. So what I can do is click on new,\nand I'll just call this lesson five. So I want my title slide. Here's lesson five. So here are the three slides\nthat make up lesson five. I'll go ahead and add those. And now I can reorder them if I\nwant to, move them up and down, but I'll go ahead and press OK. Now I can see I have Lesson 5 in here. If I go ahead and click on Show,\nit's only going to show those slides. So here's my presenter view, and\nas you can see, it's only showing those four slides that make up that\nparticular show, and we're good to go. So that is a custom show. Now, keep in mind, when we're setting\nup the slideshow, we can also say, well, let's just go ahead and run that\nLesson 5 custom slideshow here as well. So pretty good. Okay, let's go ahead and stop here. I want you to be able to practice. Go ahead and just set up your slideshow. Go ahead and practice. Make sure that your presenter\nview is turned on, it's showing on the, on the screen of your choice. And go ahead and take a look at\nsome of the different tools here. We'll come back and we'll go\nahead and take a look at some of the annotating tools that are\navailable while we are presenting. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and set up\nnavigation for our slideshow. Now remember when you were presenting. If you right click, you can pretty much go\nto a slide of your choice if you want to. Once we have the presenter view\nturned on, we can kind of jump around, but it would be nice to kind\nof give our audience really nice feature called the zoom feature. Okay. So what the zoom feature is, and I'm\nactually going to insert a slide here. So right after my title slide,\nand this will be, I'll just call this my landing slide. And what I'm going to do, I'll\njust quickly insert some links to my different lessons here. So to do that, I'll go ahead and\npress control K on my keyboard. So this will insert a hyperlink, right? So just like in the other office\ndocuments, Excel, And Word, we can link to a place in the document. So instead of linking to an\nexisting file or webpage, I'll click on place in this document. And now what I can do is I\ncan link to different slides. So I want to be able to\nlink first to lesson five. And for the text, it says\nlesson five working with media. That's perfectly fine. I'll go ahead and leave that as is. And just like that, we have a hyperlink. I'll go ahead and press enter. I'll repeat the process for 6, 7, and 8. So I'll press Ctrl K. To a place in the document,\nI want to go to Lesson 6. I'll accept the text. I'll press OK. I'll do that two more times. Ctrl K. This time, Lesson 7. And I'll go ahead and press OK. One more time. Control K, and this will be for Lesson 8. Right. So I have a nice little\nlanding slide here. So basically, if I go into, if I\nrun this in reading mode, what I can do is I can click on this link\nwhile I'm presenting, and this will take me to that particular slide. Now it would be nice if we can go\nback to that landing slide, have a little button that we can click\non, so we can always go back. Right. I want to be able to get back to this\nslide by just clicking on a button. So we have what's called a zoom feature. Now check this out. Look what I'm going to do here. I'll go to lesson five, and from\nlesson five I want to be able to go back to the landing slide. I'm going to drag my landing slide. Just going to click and drag it. I can drag it right onto my slide here. Maybe I'll put it right, right here. Okay. And then I'll move this\nother icon out of the way. I'll put this down here somewhere. All right. So you're saying, well,\nwhat just happened? What did you just do? I'm just going to position\nthis up here at the top. So this is called a zoom feature. So now I have a link to a\nslide and another slide. Let's go into reading mode\nand let's see how this works. Here we go. So I'm here on this particular slide. And now if I want to go back to\nmy landing slide, if I click here, so it zooms in to that slide for me. And now what I can do is I can go ahead\nand jump to another lesson here as well. If I press the back key, it\ngoes back to lesson five. Or I can just go ahead\nand click back here. And jump back to lesson five as well. So that is the zoom feature as well. Now what I can do if I wanted to,\nI can go ahead and change this. So right now it's just\na picture of my slide. If I click on here, I'll notice that\na zoom tab appears here as well. So maybe what I'll do is I'll go ahead\nand change this image to something else. And maybe I'll grab an icon. And maybe I'll look for a home icon. Maybe I'll use this one. So I've converted this to a home icon. Now I can resize it. I can even put it at a\nstyle to it if I want to. I'll keep it simple. I'll just put it here on\nthe top right of my slide. There you go. So that's my zoom feature. Now what I can do, I\ncan actually copy this. And I can paste it on lesson six. I just need to move this out of the way. So I'll go ahead and paste\nthis here on Lesson 6. And I just copied and pasted it. Well, let's see if this still works. I'll go ahead and run this\nslide in reading mode. If I click on it, it brings\nme to my landing slide. I'll go back to Lesson\n6, and I'm good to go. So that's the zoom feature. All right, so go ahead and create\nyour first zoom, go ahead and change it to an icon of your choice. Again, to do that, just click on the\nzoom, click on the zoom tab, and you can change the image here as well. Go ahead and add that home button\nto each of your lesson slides, and now we'll be able to navigate back\nand forth as we are presenting. Now that we've added some navigation and\nwe've set up some of the basics, it's time to go ahead and present and take a look\nat some of the tools that are available. We already discussed the presenter view\nso now what we can do, let's take a look at how we can annotate a presentation and\nwe can enable these subtitles as well. Now we can accomplish these as\nwell through the presenter view. I'm going to go back to my slideshow. Let's just make sure that I'll\nturn off my presented view. And I want my slideshow\nto run on this screen. So everything is good to go. I want to make sure all\nof my slides are selected. And from here, if I want to, I can go\nahead and choose my laser pointer color. I will be using the laser pointer. I'll be using the pen as well. So I can actually select\nmy color ahead of time. I'll leave them both on red. I'll go ahead and press okay. You can press F5 to start your slideshow. So here's my slideshow. I'll go ahead and head on over to\nmy next slide here just by clicking. And so here's my landing slide. I'll just go to lesson 5 here. And here's lesson 5. Now on the bottom we have\nsome kind of grayed out tools. So we can go to the last slide,\nwe can go to the next slide. Here are the pen tools down here. So if I click here. I can either choose my laser pointer, so I can go ahead and just\nkind of point on my screen. If I go back down here, I\ncan change that to the pen. And the pen basically allows us\nto just kind of mark things up. So I can do things like that. Terrible arrow. Right, so we can do that. If I want to go back, I\nwill just uncheck the pen. Now I have my pointer back here, and\nnow I can go ahead and either play my video or go to the next slide. I'll go to my next slide here as well. And what else do I have here? Here's the highlighter. So if I want to highlight\nsomething, turn on my highlighter, go ahead and highlight it here. And of course we can change the color. So. We can change the color for all\nof the ink down here as well. So for my highlighter, if I wanted\ninstead of yellow, maybe I want orange. Here's my orange highlighter\nhere as well that I can use. Now, let's go ahead and I'll\nget my pointer back here. So I'll unselect my highlighter. If I move over to the right,\nhere's the slide sorter. And here are the subtitles, so I\ncan go ahead and Turn those on. And this is what my screen now looks like. This is very helpful. And we're good to go. Turn on my video if I want to. And then here are some other tools. So if I wanted to transition\nto a custom show, I can. Even though I'm not running presenter\nview right now, I can still go ahead and turn that on here as well. And for the subtitle settings. I can either show them on the top where\nit's overlaid on my presentation or I can change the location of it as well. Maybe I'll put it be above\nthe slide, the top like that. So we have different options\nthat we can use here. Now, if you didn't mark up your slide,\nwe do have an eraser here as well. So you can erase them individually\nor you can choose to go ahead and erase all of the ink on a slide. All right, now keep in mind when\nyou are marking up your slide here, all of the ink will remain\nunless you remove it. So if I were to close my presentation\nhere and go back to this slide, this arrow and this somewhat of a circle\nshow up as shapes here as well. So we want to make sure it will ask you\nanyway, before you close the presentation, do you want to remove all the ink as well? But while we're here, let's\ntest out our navigation. I'll get my pointer back here\nand I'll jump to the, let's jump to lesson number eight. And from lesson number eight, we\ncan go back to that landing slide and jump to lesson number five. So pretty cool. So we're zooming in and\nout of our landing slide. If you press the back key, After\nyou go to your landing slide, it goes back to the slide that\nyou were on before here as well. All right, I'll go ahead and end the show. I'll just go ahead and\npress the escape key. And it asks me right here, do\nI want to keep my annotations? I do not, because again, they will\nappear as shapes on your slide. I'll go ahead and discard\nthem, and I am good to go. All right, so a lot of things that\nwe just accomplished, annotating, turning on the subtitles. We can use the presenter\nview for that as well. And we'll see those\noptions are also available. So go ahead and run your slideshow. When we come back, we'll\nput it all together. We'll take a look at how we\ncan record our slideshow so that it can run automatically. Welcome back. Let's go ahead and move\non to lesson number eight. What we want to do here is we want to\ngo ahead and automate our slideshow. So we don't want to sit and click\nthrough our slides as we're presenting. What we'd like to do is to kind\nslideshow and then we can go ahead and play it back and run it so that all the\nslides will transition automatically. So let's take a look and\nsee how we can do that here. If I click on the slideshow tab, I have the record option here, so\nI can record from the beginning. And notice what it says. So records narrations,\nanimations, transitions, ink, and laser pointer gestures. So everything that I'm doing\nwill be recorded here as well. So we don't necessarily need to\nrehearse timings because now we have the recording feature that\nwill record everything for us. So what I'm going to do, I want my\nrecorder window to show up on here. So I'll just change this here. And then I'll go ahead and press OK,\njust so we can see what that looks like. I'll go back to the first slide, and\nI'll click on record from the beginning. And this is going to open up\nmy, my recording view here. Now, before we do that, I highly\nrecommend that you use this feature called Rehearse with Coach. This is a really, really nice tool. Basically you can practice with\nthe AI coach and it's very, very intuitive and very, very robust. It's going to provide you feedback to let\nyou know if you're talking too fast, if your pace is too slow, if your voice is\nmonotone, if you're speaking too loud, too soft, if you're using filler words. So it gives you a really, really nice\nreport, kind of coaches you along the way. It'll say, great job, keep it up. So I highly recommend you\nuse the rehearse with coach. It will allow you to go through\nyour entire slide and you can practice with it there as well. Once you've done that, we'll\ngo ahead and click on record. Alright, we can also record our\nslideshow from the record tab. So here's the record from the beginning. Now, there's a lot of things\nthat we can do in here. We'll just touch on a few of them. So here we can see, here is\nthe window for our recording. Once we're ready, we just need to go\nahead and click on the record button. Just a few things to note. If you wanted to turn\non your camera, you can. Your camera will appear, um,\ndown here on the bottom right. So your image will appear down\nhere on the bottom right as well. At the very top, when you have\nnotes, we have a little teleprompter here that will help you as you're\ngoing through your actual slides. Now this is one view. Down here on the bottom right,\nthere are different views. So right now, this is\nthe teleprompter view. Let's click on this dropdown. The other one is the presenter view. So the presenter view, this is\nthe one that we're accustomed to. We can kind of see what's coming next,\neither an animation or a next slide. And we can see what our\naudience is seeing here as well. Right. Then we have other things down here. Laser pointer. Highlighter. They're all here for us as well. The other view is the slide view. So this is just your operating\njust with the slides and you can go through it there as well. I'm going to go back to\nteleprompter view and here we go. So if you want to record your\nmicrophone, you can either turn it off or you can turn it on. Um, as well, if we click\nhere for more options. You can select the microphone\nthat you want to use. You can select your camera, and if\nyou're using Cameo, which is a newer feature, you can use Cameo as well. I'm just going to do a simple recording,\njust so that we can see what the finished product will look like here. So, I'm not going to spend\ntoo much time on each slide. Here we go. Welcome to PowerPoint Module 4. My name is Mo Jones. Let's go ahead and learn together. Here's our landing slide. We have four lessons. Lesson number five, lesson\nnumber six, lesson number seven, and then finally lesson number\neight, automating a slideshow. Lesson five is all about\nworking with media. We can either insert local video\nor we can insert online video. Here's my video. I can go ahead and play this here. Once I'm done, I can go ahead and\nmove on to my next slide here. I'll go ahead and turn on my, where\nis my pen, so I can go ahead and just draw some shapes in here if I want to. I'll go to my next slide. Here's my notes at the top,\nso I can refer to that as I'm going through my slides here. So when we're inserting\nthe screen recorder. It's a matter of getting to\nthis particular icon here or this command group, the media\ncommand group on the insert tab. Remember after you insert your\nscreen recording to take a look at the playback options and the\nother formatting options as well. Lesson six is all about collaborating. As we can see, we can go ahead and\nshare a file, grant editing access. And we can go ahead and\nmark up the file together. We can see who's in the file, where\nthey're currently working on, and we can add comments to the file as well. Lesson number seven is all about some of\nthe other default settings that we can establish for our presentation as well. Don't forget about the zoom feature. We can always click on that button to\ngo back to the slide of our choice. And then finally, for lesson number\neight, I highly recommend that you record your presentation and use the\nrehearse with coach tool here as well. Now when we finish this slide\nshow, it tells us to click here to export our video. So I'll go ahead and click there\nand I can go ahead and export it to, to the location of my choice here. I'll go ahead and click on browse. Typically, you want to upload\nit to your OneDrive space. I'll just put it on my desktop here. I'll just call this copy. And I'll go ahead and\nexport that as a MP4 video. And that's going to take a\nlittle bit of time to record. Once it's finished, I'll come right back. So finally, I get the message that\nmy video was exported successfully. So from here, I can click here to view\nthe video and share with others as well. I'll go ahead and click here. And it's asking me, I do trust it. I'll go ahead and press yes. And just giving me some\nsecurity messages here. I'll just go ahead and\npress okay to open the file. Opens up in my default media\nplayer, and here we go. So there we go. So we can see everything\nhas been recorded as well. And we're good to go. I'll go ahead and close this out. And we're good to go. So that is how we record a slideshow. So notice now, for each slide,\nwe'll see the actual voice note that was left on each slide. So every slide has a\nlittle recording here. So in the past, we would have to do\nthese things kind of manually, insert the audio, insert the timings as well. But now the recording takes care\nof everything for us as well. So go ahead and record your, your\nshow, go ahead and export it. And then go ahead and play it,\nmake sure everything is okay. If you want to go ahead and share it. Feel free to do so as well. Now that we have recorded our\nslideshow, we see that everything was recorded well, we did have the option\nof exporting it to a media file, but something else happened as well. So if I were to go ahead and\njust run my slideshow, it's going to run automatically. So the timings for each slide, the voice\nnarration on each slide, and any ink. or markup that I used\nwill be played as well. So if I did not want to play the video, I\njust want to go ahead and run this slide. I'll go ahead and run it here. And we can see the voice\nnarration is included. We can see the slides are moving\nautomatically without my interaction. Okay, now I can still\njump in if I want to. But for the most part, everything is\nhappening automatically here as well. So I'll press escape. And we're good to go. So you can either share that video or play\nthe video, or you can, you can just come in and actually just run your slideshow. And here's a little bit of ink\nthat I left when I was kind of annotating my coffee cup here. So I'll just click on here, and\nI'll just go ahead and delete that from my slide as well. If you go back to the record tab,\nnow you'll notice that some of these other options are available\nbecause we did perform a recording. We can do some other things\nlike clear the recording on the current slide, or we can clear the\nrecording from all of the slides. Maybe we just want to go\nahead and redo it, right? We can save it as a show, right? So we can create a separate\nslide with the PPSX. extension there as well. We can export it to\nvideo from here as well. We can learn more to see what's new,\nwhat else we can do here as well. We can also use the cameo feature\nas well with our camera feed. So that's the benefit of recording a show. We can automate it and we still\nhave the capability to kind of interact with the slides, even\nthough it's automated here as well. Just to recap, we're able to\ncustomize the PowerPoint environment. We saw how we can create our own\nribbon tab and add our own command groups and our own commands as well. Even add more commands to\nour Quick Access Toolbar. We took a look at the Slide Master. We're able to customize design templates. We're able to save a design as a\ntemplate, and then we're able to create some infographics with SmartArt. We're able to work with media. We're able to collaborate on a\npresentation after saving the presentation to a cloud space. We're able to customize a slideshow\nbehavior, establishing some of the default settings for our slideshow, and then we're\nable to automate a slideshow as well. Remember to use the Rehearse\nwith Coach tool, and then go ahead and record your slideshow. Congrats on completing the course,\nand look forward to seeing you in a future LearnIt course. Hello everyone and welcome to\nCoPilot for Microsoft PowerPoint. My name is Joe. I'm going to be facilitating\nthis course for you today. Today we are talking about Microsoft\nPowerPoint with CoPilot capabilities. CoPilot is amazing with PowerPoint and it\nallows us to start to create presentations within seconds of just telling it what\nwe want to see in our presentation. Now, before we get into\nMicrosoft PowerPoint, we have to understand what is CoPilot. CoPilot is a powerful admin tool\nfor Microsoft Excel that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. improve efficiency, and also save time. Now it utilizes machine learning\nand AI technology to analyze your workflow and then suggest code\nsnippets based on your specific needs. And with Copilot, you can automate data\nmanipulation, formatting, calculations, and so much more without actually\nneeding extensive programming knowledge. Now a couple things with Copilot is\nthe way that it comes out with outputs. An input is when you ask it a question,\nand then the output will be the result or the answer to that question. And the way that it randomizes this\nis known as stochastic process. Now stochastic process in AI models\ncan lead to slightly different results each time the model is run. So even though we put in the same input,\nright, I can say, Hey, how much does this? equal out to my total sales. It might not be word for\nword the same exact output. And this is often what is desired, right? We often want randomness so that\nnone of us have the same answers. So just know that if you're following\nalong with this video, that you will never get the same answer as me, unless\nit's something really straightforward. Like give me the total\nsales that I've made. It will give you the total sales. That's not random, but if you ask\nthem to give you insights, it might give you something totally different\nthan the insights that gives me another thing is a couple of the\npros and cons of using co pilot. So we're going to start off with the pros. Productivity boost, right? It aims to enhance productivity by\nautomating various tasks, such as writing emails or creating presentations, or even\ntaking meeting notes, which is great. We can also integrate it with Microsoft\nSuite, which is what we're doing today. We are going to be looking at\nExcel's version of Copilot. We also have to understand\nthat it is a natural language process, which means we're able\nto just put in inputs naturally. And then we get results. And the best part about Copilot\nis learning and adaptation. It's always designed to learn\nfrom our user interactions. So the more questions we ask over\ntime, it starts to understand how we think about our data. Now, some of the cons of using\nCopilot are first off potential bias and inaccuracies, right? Of course, this is a new technology,\nso sometimes it might be generate an accurate information based\non the data it was trained on. And you'll notice that throughout\nthe course that sometimes I might not get the exact answer I want\nand I need to teach it what I want. You'll also see here that there's\nan adoption and learning curve. As with any new technology, you're\ngoing to have to get used to using the interface or even certain input commands\nthat you're going to ask it or certain prompts that you want to look at. So that's why this video is going\nto be super helpful for you, because it's going to allow for you to\nunderstand those learning curves. And last but not least,\nethical concerns, of course. You know, it's an AI assistant,\nso we want to make sure that we're not just using it to generate\nmisinformation or plagiarized content. Now, last quick note before we actually\ndive into this, is that Microsoft Copilot is still in development, and\nits final capabilities, the pricing, availability, is yet to be determined. So as with anything else that is AI\npowered, it's crucial to approach it with a critical mindset, right? We want to be sure that we're\nmaintaining our privacy and security. We're going to comply with any\nof our company's rules, right? And this AI is definitely\nnot a replacement for human expertise or decision making. So we are actually using it\nas a tool and replacement. I've opened up PowerPoint and\njust created a blank presentation. Now we're going to use co pilot to\nactually create a presentation for us. So in order to do this, we're\ngoing to go through the home tab. And inside of the Home tab, we're\ngoing to go all the way at the end, and you'll see Copilot. Now, funny enough, you'll\nsee Copilot next to Designer. We're going to talk about\nthis in a later section, but they go hand in hand together. But for now, let's just open up Copilot\nPane, and you'll see once you click on Copilot, it opens up the pane. Now, right away when you open up\nCopilot Pane, you can see here that there's some things you can try. So they give you a couple of prompts\nright away, like create a presentation. Or create a presentation from\na file that already exists, or add a slide about something. So you can use these three\nprompts right away, or you can ask questions about the presentation. Or if you want to view more of the\nprompts, you'll see at the bottom, there's this little book icon. This is actually where we can\nview prompts for PowerPoint. So if you click on it, You'll see\nwe can either create, and if you click the little parent icon, it\nshows you create a presentation from a file, create a presentation about\nsomething, add a slide about something. You can go to edit, or you\ncan add an image of something. That's a pretty cool one. We can go to ask where we can give\nspecific examples for something. And if you want to view more prompts,\njust click on view more prompts and it'll open up prompts from the co pilot lab. We'll talk about co pilot lab in\na little bit, but this is where we can see other prompts as well. I'll just click the X. So let's try it out. Let's actually create a\npresentation from scratch. So you can either just click\ncreate a presentation, or you could just type it out here. I like to just click it because it\nautomatically fills it in for you. And let's create a presentation. Uh, we can do it about anything,\nbut what I'm interested in is creating a presentation about\nhealth and we'll just say health. Let's see what it, what it comes up\nwith, create a presentation about health. And it's going to take a moment. It's just thinking about everything,\ngoing through all the different information and data that Copilot\nhas access to, and you can see at the bottom, it's starting to work. It's downloading media. And there we go. It says, okay, here you go. A presentation about health has\nbeen created with multiple slides. If you like, I can help you\nrewrite slides or you can use Designer to adjust the layout. Once again, Designer is going\nto come in handy in the way that you want to change the design. Now, what I love about this is that look\nhow amazing this presentation looks. First off, we get this starting\npage here, the starting slide where it says tips for a healthy life. It has a nice little background picture\nand believe it or not, we also have access to Yeah, speaker note, so we\ncan quickly talk to, um, you know, an audience and have those speaker notes. You'll also see here, you could\npress play, and it has a movement. Yeah, it's a media. How awesome is this? I just love this so much. I really do. So, that's another fun thing, and it\njust stays on a loop until you stop it. If we go to the next slide, it says\neat a balanced diet, eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables,\ninclude whole grains and lean protein in your diet, and limit your intake\nof sugar, salt, and saturated fats. So that makes sense. And then you have your speaker\nnotes at the bottom here as well. On the next page, we have stay\nhydrated, drink at least eight cups of water a day, avoid sugary\ndrinks, limit alcohol consumption. Go to the next slide. It just has an awesome amount of\ninformation, regular exercise is good for you, and manage stress. So as you can see, within seconds, it\nhas created a full presentation for us, with speaker notes, with images. But you might be wondering,\ndoes it include animation? Well, let's take a look. So we see here, the nice movement, go to our next slide. So right now there are no\nanimations here, go to the next one. That's the one thing that\nwe wouldn't need to include. So if I ask it to include\nanimations, let's see what it says. I don't think Copilot can do\nthis yet, but I want to see. Can you add animation to my bullet points? Let's see what it says here. I'm going to say that it's going to\nprobably come back with it can't do it yet, but I'm always curious because\nthey're constantly updating these apps. Pulling things together. Okay, so yeah, I can't do it. I can answer general questions\nor those about presentations, but they can't add animations. So that's just one little thing you\nhave to do, which it's simple enough. I'll just go to animations and\njust fly them in real quick. Boom. Done. Go to the next one. Just click. Flying. Done. Go to the next one. Click. Flying. Done, and we have a fully\ncreated presentation with speaker notes, and we are all set to go. Now, why I love speaker notes so\nmuch for me personally, is because I use them while I'm presenting. For instance, when I'm presenting,\nI actually don't see this view. I see my presenter view and what\nthis presenter view does for me is it allows for me to see my\nspeaker notes on the other side. So I'm going to showcase this to everyone. There it is. So now I have my speaker notes right here. I know exactly what people\nare seeing currently. And also, I can see what I'm\ngetting ready to talk about now. So I would say, Hey everyone, my\nname is Joe, we're talking about tips for a healthy lifestyle. Health is wealth, and nothing is more\nimportant than taking care of your body. Incorporating these tips into\nyour lifestyle can lead to a healthier, happier life. See what I did there? I didn't even have to think\nabout what I was going to say. The notes are already there for me. And then when I'm ready to go\nto the next slide here, now I can say, eat a balanced diet. This is one of the most important\nthings you can do for your health, and then I can go through. Eat a variety of fresh fruits and\nvegetables, whole grains, right? So, those speaker notes, I\nalways say are some of the most important things that you need. Yeah, this is amazing. We asked it to create a presentation\nand it went above and beyond. We just went over how we can\ncreate a presentation from scratch with just a sentence in Copilot. Now I'm going to show you how\nCopilot works with templates that are pre existing. So, the first thing I want\nto do is select a template. So you can go to More Themes on\nyour Startup page, and you can look for whatever makes sense to you. Let's go with I really like this design\nright here, this Minimalist Presentation. So I'm going to use that\none, and click Create. Now at this point, it all has some sort\nof theme here with different topics. And I'm actually going to use CodePilot\nonce again to create another presentation. But what I'm interested to see is,\nis it going to keep my existing theme or is it going to replace it? So can we use our template? With creating a presentation. So I'm going to see if I can do\nthat, create a presentation about lions, but keep my same name\nand let's see if it can do this. It's looking over it. It's going to be very exciting. And I love exploring\nlike this with co pilot. This is something you\ncan do to see what works. What doesn't work. It's a learning. And ever learning, let's see what it says. Okay. So it says that creating\na new presentation will replace your existing slide. So you may want to save a copy first,\nor I can say create a new draft. Let's create a new draft and see what it does with this. Like I said, it's an ever learning system. So this is what's most exciting. So it did replace it, but I mean, it\nkept some of that coloration there. Once again, we do get the\nlions, the king of the jungle. I love that. Combined behaviors. Line physical characteristics. We get a bunch of notes with it as\nwell, and we're just ready to go. The one thing that we have to do\nas always is add in animation. So while this presentation\nlooks really amazing, it is not using my original theme. So it's better off if you're gonna\nuse Copilot for presentations. I would say just simply use a blank\npresentation, because choosing a template is just not going to work anyway. For those of you that might have\ncompanies, That need to really think about branding and they might have\npre existing slides for you, let's say what I would do in that case is\nafter you get the presentation, and I would just strip away everything. So you'll see here that\nthe slides are here. We could change this to a title\nslide, or we can change this layout. Look like this, but they still\nexist your original theme, their original layout, your design. You're going to have to change each slide. So for this one, once again, I\nwant this to just be the section one or an agenda or content. So I'll call this agenda. I'll do this one as an\nagenda layout as well. And just be careful because\nyou see what's happening with the text boxes and everything. We're going to have to switch those back. So. You can still switch these\nto what it needs to be. If I want to change the layout, so let's\nsay two content, it keeps your content there and just the other way it wasn't\nshowcasing and you can still have it be as similar to your branding or to your\nlayouts that already exist as you can. And there it is. All right. So that's one way to sort\nof overcome that template. If you are forced to use some sort of\ntemplate like that, do I see this for, you know, changing in the foreseeable future? Maybe, you know, we'll, we'll see. I know Microsoft is trying to\nbe as accommodating as possible. So you will notice designer keeps\npopping up like I said before copilot and designer are working together very\nwell We're actually going to discuss that in our next section So what we're\ngoing to talk about next is how copilot and designer work so well together\nSo the first thing I'm going to do is create a presentation with copilot I want to talk about sharks. So I'm going to say create\na presentation about sharks. They're interesting, right? So create a presentation about sharks. It's going to work on it. Look over the things for us. All this stuff that it always does. And then once it comes through,\nwe'll take a look at what sort of design it does for us. So it looks like for this\none, it's not working. It says, I'm sorry, I'm not able\nto generate those slides for you. Is there something else I can do to\nhelp you build your presentation? Let's do the same prompt, because it's\nfunny to see, as I explained before, that this process is randomized. So all the outputs are always randomized. Preprint does it for the next\ntime and it looks like it might not work for a second time. Oh, actually it's working this time. And look at that. So funny enough, this is a prime\nexample of how young co pilot truly is. That's why I always say to you, if it\ndoesn't work the first time, try it again. This is just proof right here that\nsometimes it's not going to work the first time around, but it will work the second\nand look how amazing these speaker notes are too, it has so many different things. So, and I love this. Look at this. The media background. That's always so cool. Now at this point, I'm going to\nalso open up my designer because some of these signs I might not\nlike, for instance, I do like this. This looks great, but it doesn't\nlook like the rest of it. There's a lot of like pink\nand light colors, purples. But then there's just\nthis dark color here. This would make more sense for me. I actually like this one more. And then I can have it like that. So that just looks a lot nicer\nfor me than that other one. So that's why the designer just\ncomes into play right away. It looks so great. So at this point, let's take a look\nat what they actually put in here. Pictures. I like the little pluses and ohs. Sharks and their behaviors. Remember, we always have to go\nin and add the animations, shark anatomy. You know, I really don't\nlike the way this looks. So once again, I'm going to go\nover, I'm going to go to my home tab and choose designer and let's see\nwhat else they could come up with. Okay. This looks a little lighter. I do like this. The reason I don't like the way\nthat this one looks is it sort of looks less like content, and it\nlooks more like a section change. And I'm not changing, you know,\ntalking about the topic of charts. So that's why I want\nto change this design. It's important to do that, have\nsimilar designs going through. Same thing here. I want it to look a little more similar to what we have. Let's see if I can do this one too. Oh, there it is. And now we have everything\nlooking super similar. It looks very consistent. And once again, I'm just going to add in\nhere all of my animations, and then I'll tell you what the overall outcome is. It's just going to look great. Let's see what it looks like. So here we go. The wonders of sharks. Sharks in their behaviors. Three points about that\nshark anatomy there. Sharks in conservation, shark myths and facts. Sharks and popular culture come\nup with sharks in the clouds. I don't even know why the direct in\nthe clouds like that, but there we go. We have an amazing presentation\nright away, and we were able to then sort of make it more consistent. With the designer. So that's why I always say co pilot\ndesigner go together Well, and what I love about this new system is that\nyou'll see co pilot up top You can switch to designer at the bottom so\nyou can switch between two quickly The next thing I want to talk\nabout is how we can actually add slides to our presentation. So We have this presentation here,\nwe've been talking about charts, and what I want to do is you can\nclick on change topic if you like. What this does is it refreshes\nall of your past prompt. So when you're asking about things and\nyou sort of want to change gears or change topic, you can click change topic. It's going to reset all\nyour history of prompts. And then it's like, what\nwould you like to do now? Now this is going to go back\nto our original three prompts. We've created a presentation. We'll actually talk about creating\nthe presentation from a file in a moment, but we want to talk about\nhow can we add a slide about. So I'm thinking I have sharks, their\nbehaviors, anatomy, conservation, myths, facts, and popular culture, but\nI don't really have anything about the relationship between sharks and humans. I'm going to choose to add a\nslide about, or you could just. Type it. I'm going to say add a\nslide about the relationship between sharks and humans. Let's see if it can do that for us. Remember, if it doesn't work the\nfirst time, always just try again. Oh, there we go. So you'll see here, once again,\nit keeps the design, which I love. We don't have to worry\nabout design issues. It continues to stay consistent. It adds a ton of fun little\nnotes here that we can use. And then we see the relationship\nbetween sharks and humans. Sharks are not usually\naggressive towards humans. Shark attacks are rare and often\nthe result of mistaken identity. Human activity has greatly\nimpacted shark populations. So now we have a little more information. If I want, I can add even more to this. I can ask it to edit this slide. So, let's say that I do\nwant to edit this slide. I can say to please edit slide 7 to\ninclude two more facts about relationships between sharks and whales. and humans. And let's see what it does. And it's always important to\nget a little more specific. For instance, I'm saying,\nplease edit slide seven. I'm not just saying, please edit, you\nknow, to include two more facts about relationships between sharks and humans. I'm specifying that I wanted to add\nthis information to slide seven. So we'll see what it can do. So right now it says, I'm\nsorry, but I can't do that. Let's ask it to do something\na little different. Let's say, please rewrite. I did forget the S on slide, so\nwe'll see what happens, but hopefully it'll understand what I meant. Okay, so it couldn't do that either. Let's keep trying. Let's say, Please add more\ninfo or more information to this slide. Let's see if it can do that. And I'm saying this slide now to see if\nit knows that I selected on slide seven, but once again, this is just stuff and I'm\nnot sure which slides you're referring to. Could you please specify? And I'll say, um, what is the\naverage life span of a chart? What is the different types? No, we'll actually answer this. We'll say, Please add more information to slide 7. I think it was almost there. It was almost ready to go, so. And it also started giving us\nprompts to ask more questions about sharks, which I think is awesome. So let's do this. What are different types of sharks? Let's ask that question. And see what it comes up with\nand see if we can actually add this to this slide deck. Oh wow, look at all of these. That's pretty cool. So it gives us all of this and we\ncan quickly copy this information and then put it on a slide. Or we could have just said, you know,\nplease add in how many different species of sharks there are as a slide. So as you can see, editing slides\naren't as easy as it looks. You know, you can't just say,\nhey, edit my slide, because it's not understanding what I want. But we're going to just try one more\ntime to see if I can please add more information to the slide setting. Because as you can see, sometimes\nit works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes you just have to\nrepeat yourself because you always get a randomized output. So you can ask the same\nquestion three times and get a different answer each time. Except when it comes to data. If you're asking, for instance, you know,\nhow many words are in this presentation, that's going to always be the same. So yeah, it looks like it's\nnot going to allow us to do it for this one, but that's okay. Let's see other prompts\nthat we can actually use. in terms of edit. Add an image of something or\norganize this presentation. So even though we can't really edit\nthe slide so well, we can edit by adding images or even organizing. What about understanding? So to summarize this presentation, we're\nactually going to talk about being able to do this a little later, create, We\ncan create a presentation or add a slide about, we just did that, so try out\ndifferent prompts for adding and editing your slides and see what you come up with. So you'll see here that I have this\nhealthy eating habits document, and I decided that I actually don't\nwant to just have this document like this, I actually want to turn\nthis into a PowerPoint presentation. We can take a file from our computers\nand transform them into PowerPoint presentations with CoPilot now. It is amazing. So let's see what it comes up with. We have healthy eating habits. We have an introduction, then we\ntalk about balanced nutrition, portion control, hydration,\nfiber rich foods, and that's it. It's just a quick one page document,\nbut let's see What happens? So the first thing I'm going\nto do is switch over and let's switch over to PowerPoint. I just opened up a blank presentation\nand I'm going to use the prompt create presentation from file. When it does that, it pulls up all these\ndifferent files that we have access to and it tells you to type or search a copy\nor paste the link of the Word document. Now we know what the Word document's\ncalled, so I'm going to type in a couple of words here, and I'm going to\ngrab my document, Word Intro Example. Once I have that document, I'll then click\nSend, and let's see what it comes up with. Now, it is looking through an entire\ndocument, and then it's going to transform it into a presentation, so it\nmight take a little bit of time here. But it shouldn't take more than two\nminutes, and you'll see that it's starting to outline the presentation\nthat it's going to generate. So it's saying, here's the outline. We're talking about healthy eating habits,\nintroduction, balanced nutrition, portion control, hydration, fiber rich foods. So everything we just read\nabout in that document. And now it's generating the slides,\nadding speaker notes as well. And look at this, I mean, this is amazing. We now have our entire Word document\ntransformed into a slideshow. Introduction, I love this. Balance and expression, all\nthe things we've talked about. Portion control, all the pictures. Adjuration. I mean, this is just within seconds. It's, it's not even taken us that long. It just looks awesome. Now, I will say this isn't\nperfect, as you can see here. These last slides are a little weird. Vegetables, I kind of\nsplit it, nuts, and fruits. I'll probably delete those\ntwo and just add these in and change this bullet point too. I don't know what that bullet point was. So even though it came over and it\nwas pretty much perfect, there are a couple of things I still need to edit. So I'll add in the nuts here and, and then we could get rid of these ones. And I think that looks great. Let's see, whole grains,\nFiber rich, fiber rich. So we're gonna have to make a change here. Let's see what we can do. I'm, just gonna take this\nand copy it or even cut it. Let's paste it here. Let's make this into a slide deck and Okay And let's make this the same. I'll use my format painter. Those all look good I want them\nto all be on the same level and this is going to look amazing And\nthen we're going to use that designer tool just like before I do want them all to,\nI mean, it won't matter once we change the designer, leave this out and let's\nsee what designer comes up with this one. I actually like this a lot, but\nit doesn't really stay consistent. I mean, a little bit. Yeah, I guess we can still use it. It's pretty much the\nsame, but I do like this. All right. And there we go. We have now just taken our Word\ndocument right here and changed it into a PowerPoint presentation. I think that's just amazing. I don't know. It has speaker notes. The only thing we really had\nto do was a couple of edits. add animations, and we're good to go. Now that I have a slide deck presentation\nwith a lot of information, what I want to do is go to change topic. I actually want to start to ask some\nquestions about our presentation. So it's going to say, what\nwould you like to talk about? I want to view some of the prompts that\nwe have where I can understand Let's say, summarize this, are there any dates? I also can go to ask to see, give me a\nspecific example from this presentation on how I can improve it for a leader. That's actually a really good one. Let's see if I could do that. Oh, I can improve it for\nmy stakeholders and see if they can give me\nspecific examples on this. And this is pretty amazing. You'll hear me say that a lot because\nCopilot really is, I mean, there's just so much you can do with it. So it says this response isn't\nbased on the presentation. It says add visuals, use images, charts. So it's just giving me some feedback on\noverall how to make a presentation better. It's not actually talking about\nthis specific presentation. But if I do want to talk about\nthis specific presentation. You can just add, ask questions\nabout it, like how many slides do I have, how many slides do I\nhave, and let's see what it does, or are there enough images\nin this presentation. According to this presentation,\nyour presentation has seven slides. Now I can even get prompted\nfor more questions about this specific presentation. For instance, what is the\ntopic of this presentation? And then it's going to work on it. Let's see what it comes up with. So this is great. Here's a summary of the deck. So I didn't ask for quite a summary,\nbut this kind of brings us into our next topic, which is being able to\nsummarize our entire presentation. But here's a couple of main ideas here. Healthy eating, balanced nutrition. You'll even see where it's linked to and\nyou can click straight onto the slide. I think it's pretty awesome. Let's say, what is the\nagenda of this presentation? According to this presentation,\nintroduction, balance, nutrition, now it starts to pull out even more information. So now I'm getting deeper\ninto our co pilot, right? And to the relevant questions\nto this presentation. So now I'm going to ask, what is\nthe importance of fortune control? Now, this might not pull\na reference directly. This is directly from my presentation\nand even references slide 1. Right or introduction slide. If I was to ask what is the\nimportance of portion control, it might actually pull this data. It's pulling it from presentation. So this is pretty awesome. Look at that. Pulling it from the portion control\nand it makes a link straight to it. So it says, according to the\npresentation, portion control is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. If I want to see where that\nis listed, I can click here. It brings me right to it. Or what are some common portion sizes? We can ask that as well. See if it can answer that from that. presentation or it has to actually\npull information from the web. Because I don't really see\nanything about portion sizes, I just see be mindful of quantity. So even though this referenced my\npresentation, it'll tell you that this response isn't based on the presentation. It had to go outside of it to find\nthe answer, which it did still. And it gives you a common portion size. How often one cup of raw leafy\nvegetables, two to three ounces. fish or lean meat, one\ntablespoon of oil or salad. Pretty cool. Now, once we're done asking questions\nlike what are some fiber rich foods or what's the importance of hydration, if\nwe want to reset all of this, always remember to click change topic and that\nwill actually reset the whole thing. And then it says, okay,\nlet's change the subject. It's not going to Actually, ask\nany of those prompts anymore, we would have to prompt it, but ask\nquestions about your presentation. Have fun with this. So we've seen how many different\nprompts there are for co pilot, and it can be a little overwhelming. But one of the great things about\nCopilot is it offers us a way to learn about the different prompts. And if you click into View\nPrompts, you can go to View More Prompts, and it's going to open\nup this Prompts from Copilot. This is where we can see all different\ntypes of prompts, and also examples, like add an image of a puppy dog to the slide,\nor create a presentation about Hawaii. Or add an agenda slide, or create\na presentation based off of a file. There's so many different ones. Get a head start, create a presentation,\ngenerate ideas, or organize your thoughts. And there's just so many different ones. But if you wanted to see all\nthe different prompts from all the different applications, you\nwould go over to the Copilot Lab. So you'll see here this link,\nsee all prompts in Copilot Lab. And you'll give that a click. Now that we're in Copilot Lab, this is\nwhere we can explore the end product. So where Copilot exists, for\nexample, 365, Word, Teams, Outlook, PowerPoint, Excel, even in OneNote or\nWindows, Loop, Whiteboard, or Forms. You'll see all the prompts to try. And remember that Copilot Lab is here\nto teach us what sort of prompts exist. Now in the prompts to try, we can save\nprompts by clicking the little ribbon icon, and we can quickly save a prompt. So if I want to save this one, click it,\nand now I have all my saved prompts here. So that's a nice little flag system. Right next to it, you'll see we can filter\nfor whatever app we're using this for. Whether we want only Excel. Or word or even outlook prompts. And then what sort of\ncategory do you want? What prompt do you want to create\nsomething or edit it or understand it? Ask questions about it, or even\njust catch up and get summaries. You'll notice that when we're looking\nat the prompt, it'll explain what the prompt is, a nice little category, what's\nnew, and then you can see an example of what you would write for the prompt. You'll see in the bottom left hand\ncorner, what the prompt is coming from. So which application? In this case, this would be Microsoft 365. This one's a OneNote prompt. This one's an Outlook prompt. A Loop prompt. You can go through and find PowerPoint and\nthis is also what's really cool about this system is that you're learning, right? So if you're like, how do I add an\nimage to a slide, it'll showcase at an image of and then you can\nsay, for example, a puppy dog. To the slide. So if you don't remember that, you\ncan always just save this and then use them later on in your applications. Once you're there, and there's so\nmany different ones like shape. That's a pretty cool one. Microsoft created a bunch of these for us. We can click on show more, show more, and there's just\nso many different ones. Now once you go through the different\nprompts and you choose which ones you want to save and use inside of Copilot\nand those applications, you can then go back to the app and start using them. You'll see down here we do\nhave a couple of articles for quick tips for better prompts. So summarize this email\nin two bullet points. You'll see that you're giving\nmore detail and you're specifying that you want two bullet points. Thanks. That's something that we're going\nto learn about for Copilot is that we need to really be specific\non what we're asking it because, well, it's still a computer, right? We're still talking to computer language. Underneath it, we have FAQs. What is copilot prompt? What can I get done with copilot? How can I get the best\nresponses or results? You'll see a bunch of\ndifferent articles here. Now going back to the top, you can go into the get started\nand there's so many different ones. They have for home users, business admin. Let's say that I'm a business\nleader and I click into that. If you notice the service is unavailable\nright now, so these are services that are starting to come out slowly. There are slow rollout, so just,\nyou know, be patient with it. You'll see this one still unavailable. I believe admin is unavailable too. Oh, no, they finally got the admins up. So just wait for the business leaders\nthat should be coming out soon. And then we'll see here, Microsoft\nco pilot 365 documentation, get ready for co pilot with 365. It started with. Manage it, get trained on. They have so many different resources\nfor you to look at and utilize. Another thing that's really important with\nCoPilot that I always say is the plugins. This is going to plug into\ndifferent apps and integrations, not only with just Microsoft,\nwith other technologies as well. So take a look at some of the\nthings that are coming up. And once again, end user CoPilot resource,\nCoPilot lab is one of those resources. This lab is where you meet Copilot,\nyou understand what it can do, you can see it in everyday apps, and those\nare, once again, those prompts, and you can click the little save prompt. So this is more like that main page here,\nthis is the landing page for Copilot Lab, but it's pretty much the same\nif you go to prompts to try, it will just bring us back to where we were. What's new? That's always something that's important. I'm always reading up on the latest\nupdates for Microsoft CoPilot, um, you'll see here prompts of the month. What were the most important ones\nor what were things that weren't working that they've now updated? That's where I'm talking\nto the presentation. That's a really cool one. And you can upload document files. We'll actually talk about this in\none of our other classes when we get into using CoPilot with Word\nand also using it with PowerPoint. But as you can see here,\nimprovements based on our feedback. Before we talk about how you can\nsubmit feedback, it is important. Remember, this technology is young\nstill, so we need to really express what's working or not working for us\nto make sure that CoPilot can evolve into the tool that we need it to be. You can take a look at some of\nthe previous updates as well, our February updates, January, December,\njust click on the little carrot icon, and you'll see all of them. And I just love the way that they\ndisplay, like, all of the icons. You know that this is\nspecifically for Word. It tells you, you know, what it's for. We're actually going to be\ntalking about Word for the web. So transform your text and code table. This looks like it's only\navailable for Word for the web. So not for the desktop app. That's another thing that's really\nimportant when using Copilot. There's going to be different\nthings that work in the online version versus the desktop version. There we go. So, always remember that this is still\nCopilot Lab, we can have all the same tabs open up, we can switch between\nprompts to try, getting started. Remember, For Business Leader is one\nthat's not available right now, but it will be rolled out sooner than later. And there you go. One of the next things we're going\nto talk about is using Copilot with the online version of PowerPoint. So, I went to my Microsoft\n365 account, and I'm going to open up the online version. You'll even notice Copilot\nis here for 365, which we'll showcase in another video. But if I click into PowerPoint,\nand I create a blank presentation, I can now use my Copilot. And you'll see, just like\nbefore, there is a little bit of a difference with the ribbon. But if I click on Copilot, which is\nin my home tab still, it's going to give you the same prompts as before. So create a presentation, create\na presentation from a file, or even add a slide about. So, let's say that I want to I don't know,\nmaybe create a presentation about, let's do a presentation about Copilot, right? So I'm going to say create a\npresentation about Copilot. And let's see what it comes up with. We're using Copilot to create\na presentation about Copilot. A lot of fun. Let's pull things together. Remember that we do\nneed to add animations. But one of the things that I love about\nCopilot is that it adds in the speaker notes for us, the imagery for us as well. So there we go. Let's take a look. So right away we have the\npower of GitHub Copilot. How does GitHub Copilot work? So, I don't want to\nactually use GitHub Copilot. I'm actually going to change it. I'm going to say um, create a presentation\nabout Microsoft Copilot. And I'm very curious to see if since\nI'm doing another create a presentation if it's going to erase everything\nthat has already been resulted here. So it'll say create a new presentation\nwill replace your existing slide. So you may want to copy first. Save a copy. And I'm like, no, that's okay. Create a new draft. See if it's going to do it for me. All right, there we go. It replaced them. Look how cool this is once again. So introduction to Microsoft Copilot. It says, uses AI to suggest code\nsnippets trained on massive code base, saves time and increases productivity. Benefits of using Microsoft Copilot. And then limitations of it requires\ninternet connection may not work for all coding scenarios. I also want to add in a\ncouple of slides here. So let's do this. Let's say add a slide about co pilot with PowerPoint. And then I'll do add a slide about co\npilot with Excel and also Word, our three main Microsoft suite applications. Let's see. So why use Microsoft Copilot? Copilot uses AI. So it's now saying why instead\nof giving us what I wanted. It just says a slide about Copilot. But really I want to add a slide\nabout Copilot with PowerPoint. So let's, I'll keep this\none, but I'll say add a slide about PowerPoint working with Copilot. Something like that. That way then I'm a little more\nspecific and hopefully you'll understand what I mean and then\nput that information in there. And then we'll work with the\nother ones on a slide about Excel working with Codepilot and Word. Okay, there we go. That makes it exactly what I wanted. I don't know what this extra one was\nfor so we can delete that one out. That just kind of came\nup with a random one. But now I'm going to do the same thing. I'll just copy this. It'll be a lot easier. And let's paste this in. And then we'll do one more word, and then\nwe're going to see it all come together. And I do want to change\na couple of things here. I don't like all of the designs. It's always important to\nadd animations and designs. But as you can see, the online\nversion works very much the same as the desktop version. Let's do our last one here where\nwe talk about Word working with. And there we go. It is going to come through. There it is. All right. So Microsoft Copilot and\nWord, PowerPoint and Copilot. and Excel and Copilot. So now that I have this, I'm going to\nopen up my designer and let's see if we can change the designs because this kind\nof all looks a little all over the place. Um, let's see what we can do here. I actually do like this\ndesign, so I'll use this one. Let's see what it has on this one. I like, I like the line like this. I think this looks good. Uh, let's go with this one. Once again, keeping things consistent. I always think that's\nthe most important thing. All right. And let's go with a couple more and\nthen we'll add our animations and take a look at our final product. And last but not least. All right. So I think that looks good. It's more consistent with our theme and\njust see if they have any other ideas. That looks great. So we got our line here, then we have\nthe line going across for the rest of them, with our little plus in the circle. The last thing we have to do is just\nadd animations to this, and we'll do the simple fly in for all of these, and then we'll run the presentation,\nand let's take a look at some of the notes that they gave us. Just to showcase how consistent\nthe notes can be as well. It shouldn't make you sound like a robot\nwith these notes, but you never know. We always gotta take a look. So for now, let's take a look at what\nthis presentation will look like. I'm just gonna edit it in the\ndesktop app, even though we did it in the online version, just so\nwe can take a look at my notes. There we go. Now, let's actually take a look. At our presenter view. So this is what it looks like. We have here introduction to\nMicrosoft Copilot, and this is how I would present it, reading\nmy user notes that AI used for me. So here we go. A little fake presentation. Hello, everyone. My name is Joe. Today we're talking about\nintroduction to Microsoft CodePilot. Microsoft CodePilot is actually an AI\npowered intelligence code completion tool, and it uses machine learning to help\ndevelopers write code more efficiently. It uses natural language processing\nto suggest code snippets, functions, and classes as developer types make it\nquicker and easier to write the code. There we go. So that's pretty cool. And you go to your next one and you\nhave, boom, all the information there. And then you can talk about each one. Awesome. So as you can see, we\njust built a presentation. We've changed the design, we've\nadded some animation, and we've done this all in less than 10 minutes. As you can see, Copilot is so amazing\nand there's so much you can do with it. I hope you all enjoyed this course. And I'll see you all next time. Thanks. Welcome to PowerPoint tips\nfor amazing presentations. You're learning with Mo Jones,\nIT professional and educator. We have two modules for this course. In module one, we'll answer\nthree main questions. The first question we'll answer\nis what story do we want to tell? The second question is what\nretention techniques will be used? And then third, what are some of the\ncommon mistakes that we will avoid? We'll answer these three questions\nas we navigate through module one, and we'll learn some pretty\nnice tips along the way as well. Let's answer our first question. What story do we want to tell? Well, why are we talking\nabout storytelling here? Well, storytelling is a big deal\nin the business world currently, and we all like stories. Now remember, a story has three parts. Primarily, we have a beginning, we\nhave a middle, and we have an end. There's some other elements of\nstorytelling in here as well. But we'll go ahead and keep it\nsimple for our presentation. So the story that we want to tell\nis, well, how can we go from boring to engaging? So how can we go from a boring\npresentation to engaging presentations? So basically, we've seen some\nboring presentations lately. And what do they consist of? Well, they consist of low engagement. They also consist of low retention. And then, what happens in contrast\nwhen we experience, um, let's say, awesome presentations? What does that look like? You're given the opportunities to engage. And what else do we have? Well, we also have increased retention. So there's my actual story. How can we go from boring to engaging? Let's first talk about boring\npresentations and the effects of boring presentations. And then let's talk about some\nawesome presentations and the effects of awesome presentations as well. Thank you. Well, what I can do now, I\nwant to go ahead and convert this into a presentation. I'll go ahead and apply\nthe heading style here. So remember, we do have the\ncapability in PowerPoint to insert slides from an outline. So I'll go ahead and create\nthat here, and I'll go ahead and save that to my computer. And then I'll go ahead\nand open up PowerPoint. So here's my PowerPoint. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis first slide here. I'll go ahead and click on\nwhere it says new slide. And from there, what I want to do is\nI want to insert slides from outline. So I'll go ahead and click here. And here is my outline that I saved. So I'll go ahead and click here. I'll go ahead and click on insert\nand let's see what happens. So my story that was in Microsoft\nWord, I can see it's now become my PowerPoint presentation. Well, that first one, this is the title. So I'll just go ahead and change\nthe layout here to the title slide. And I'm good to go. If I click on the view tab, I can\nhead on over to the outline view. I can get a really nice\noutline here as well. And I can see, so this is\na really, really nice tip. Start your presentations in outline view. You can go ahead and either create your\noutline in here, or you can do like I did, create your outline in Word. As long as you convert them to the\nheading styles, then you can reuse slides from outline right in here as well. But we have our story. So we have seven slides\nthat will tell a story. And now it's just a matter of adding\ncontext to each of these, right? So for boring presentations, we can\ninsert some, some visuals in here and some context for low engagement. We can add some context in there as well. As a matter of fact, since I'm here,\nI'll go ahead and do that right now. I'll just go ahead and add some context. I'll worry about the\ndesign a little later. So for Low engagement. What does low engagement look like? Well, you're typically listening,\nand I'll just keep it simple. I'll just use keywords here. You're listening, you're waiting,\nmaybe waiting for something interesting or waiting to go home. And you're probably wondering what's\ngoing to happen next or wondering what's happening outside of this presentation. So we get to go. Low retention. What does that look like? Well, typically you are uninterested, and the value that's being offered is low. So low value. And as a result, you basically\nforget everything that was a part of the actual presentation. So you can see just by putting our story\non paper here, we're getting a nice little outline for our presentation. Okay. Now, if you experience awesome\npresentations, opportunities for engagement, well,\nwhat does that look like? Well, we have what's, we have\nactivities, I'll just put activity here. Another way to engage with your\naudience is to use a poll or something like a whiteboard. Pretty good. What about retention? Yeah. How do we increase retention? Well, we want to use visuals,\nwe want to use images, and very important, we want to be concise. We're good to go. So just like that, I'll go back to the\nnormal view here, and I already have the structure for my entire presentation. So that is the concept of storytelling. In the beginning, we had boring\npresentations that were resulting in low retention and low engagement, and While\nwe transition to awesome presentations, we experience opportunities for engagement\nand increased retention as well. Now let's go ahead and add some\ncontent to our presentation. I'm going to go ahead\nand use the designer. One of the reasons that presentations are\nboring is because they all look the same. This title slide, we don't\nhave to go with this. We can use the designer to get some ideas. So I'll go ahead and click\non the designer here. And I'll get some ideas. Now the designer likes a couple of things. It likes keywords, and it likes\nclean slides, and it likes images. So I'll go ahead and\ninsert some images in here. I'll go for a stock image, and\nI'll use these cutout people from the Microsoft stock here. And I'll just grab a couple. I'll grab this board gentleman here. And then I'll grab this\nengaged gentleman here. I'll insert those two. Now, the great thing about the\ndesigner, I don't have to worry about placing these and aligning them. The designer will take\ncare of that for me. So I have a couple of\noptions here that I can use. I can also change it a little later. Uh, this one here just has\na little orange accent. So from boring to engaging,\nthat's a pretty nice title slide. I can always change it to another one\nhere if I want to have some other ones. So this way we have a little\nbit of variety in here. I'll go ahead and stick\nwith this one here. And I'll move on over to my next one here. So boring presentations. So why do we have boring presentations? Well, again, it's because\nthey all look the same. Or maybe it's just too much text or maybe it's too much content. There's different reasons here as well. So I can go ahead and add\nsome information in here. I don't have any visuals here. The designer sometimes will\nprovide visuals for me. So let's see if I can get anything\nin here in terms of a visual. I just want to make sure it's consistent\nwith the first design that I chose here. So I'll go ahead and look\nfor something meaningful. Now what I could do as well is I can go\nahead and delete this text here and I can just focus on boring presentations. So I can just create a visual. So I'll copy and paste\nthis picture in here. Now let's see what\ndesign options I get now. So this slide will just be\nabout boring presentations. We don't necessarily need\nto have any content in here. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis content placeholder. And here we go. So almost like a section header. So we'll talk about boring presentations. I'll use this one. And there we go. Go ahead and move on to the next one. And now that we have some key words in\nhere, listening, waiting, wondering, the designer is going to provide us with some\nopportunities to incorporate Some graphics that represents those keywords as well. So I'll continue this pattern until\nI have really nice visuals, either icons or images for all of my slides. And just by doing that, we can increase\nengagement because we're incorporating text with visuals and we're keeping the\ninformation, the content on the slide, we're keeping it to a minimum or we're\ncondensing the actual information. So the reason that we have\nboring presentations is because we have low engagement. Everyone is listening and\nwaiting and wondering instead of engaging during the presentation. Well, what does the psychology\nsay about all of this? Well, according to the Stanford Graduate\nSchool of Business, an article by Matt Abrahams, People retain structured\ninformation up to 40 percent more reliably and accurately than information that is\npresented in a more free form manner. What does this have to\ndo with storytelling? Well, remember, when we're telling\na story, we're using a structure. In this case, we used a simple\nbeginning, middle, and end. We have some type of compare,\nsome type of contrast. And so just by incorporating storytelling\ninto our presentation, we have the capability to provide more structure. We can take our audience on a\njourney and we can compliment our presentation by using the story\nthat we're actually telling. So keeping this in mind, we can see\nthe immediate benefit of applying storytelling to our presentations. What does the psychology\nsay about retention? Before we start applying retention\ntechniques, it's important to understand Well, after the initial 10 minutes of a\npresentation ending, only 50 percent of our audience will remember what was said. That's pretty interesting. What about 24 hours later? Only 25 percent of our audience\nremembers what was said. And when we get towards the end\nof the week, only 10 percent remembers what was said. Here are some other statistics. We remember 10 percent of what we\nhear, 40 percent of what we hear and see, and we remember up to 90\npercent of what we hear, see, and do. Let's take a look at an example here. We have two pictures, picture on\nthe left, picture on the right. Picture on the left represents\nelementary school reading. Picture on the right. middle school reading. So in elementary school, love to read. What is it about the content that is\nin the book that makes us like to read? In contrast, what happens to the books in\nmiddle school where we don't like to read? Well, we can see, you know, it's\nmore academic once we get to middle school, but the main reason is\nthat the pictures were removed. So we don't have pictures anymore. In elementary school, reading books,\nthey have really nice pictures. We can make connections. We can draw conclusions. In middle school, they're replaced\nwith charts, tables, and a lot, a lot of heavy, heavy text. So we can use this\ninformation to our benefit. It's the first step to understanding\nhow we can increase retention. How can we increase retention? Well, if we take a look\nat our visual here. 10% if we provide our audience with\ntext, when we provide our audience with a visual, we increase it to 30%. And when we provide a simple text and\na visual, we increase retention to 65%. Now remember, the question we\nwant to answer is, how can we prevent our audience from just\nlistening, waiting, and wondering? Well, we need to find different\nways to make the presentation personal, actionable, conversational. And a couple of things that we can do\nis, first, we want to make sure that we are providing simple text and visuals. In the form of infographics, our\nbrain naturally likes infographics. We like to make connections and that's\nwhat infographics allows us to do. So instead of using a lot of text, we can\njust provide a really nice infographic to get our point across as well. As an example, let's take\na look at this slide. So we have a lot of text here. You're probably already reading\nwhat's on this slide here. That's naturally what we do. So this is just a little snippet from\nMicrosoft in terms of what smart art is. So it's saying quite a lot here. So one of the things that we can do\nis how can we convert this heavy text? How can we condense it so that it will\nbe more meaningful to our audience? Well, what I'm going to do, I'm going to\nseparate this into a few sentences here. So I've broken up. Those three sentences on different\nlines, and then I'll go ahead and convert those to bullet points. So now I have three bullets. And now what I'm going to do\nis condense each sentence. Now what I want to do is I want\neverything to fit on one line. I don't, I do not want my bullets\nto wrap to the next line, right? So try to keep your bullets on one line. Do not have them wrap. So I can accomplish that by just,\njust condensing this information here. So what is it actually telling me? It's basically telling me that I\ncan quickly and easily make a visual representation of my information. So I'll go ahead and\nrephrase this sentence here. So I'll get rid of some of\nthese filler words in here. I'll just say quickly make a visual\nrepresentation of your information. There we go. The next one here is just\ntelling us that we can choose. So I'll go ahead and\ncondense this as well. Choose from among many different layouts. This is actually saying two things. So I'll break this up a little further. So we can choose from among many\ndifferent layouts, and it helps us to effectively communicate. Our message or ideas\nfor the last one here. It's kind of saying the same thing twice. It can be used throughout office. For example, Excel, Outlook,\nPowerPoint and Word. So I'll just say can be\nused throughout office. And there we go. So we can see just by condensing\nit to four bullets here. Our bullets are not\nwrapping just four lines. It's much easier to\ndecipher this information. Now, think about an email. If you have an email, just\nhave four lines like this. You can easily decipher\nthe message and move on. As opposed to having a paragraph. It's a little more work to be\nable to decipher that as well. Okay, so that's the first step. I've condensed my information. Now what I'm going to do is\nconvert that to a SmartArt graphic. We can either use the designer\nto do this or create some for us. But let's take a look at how we can\ncreate our own SmartArt graphic. I'll go ahead and just choose\nany one that I want right here. Here's the short list. Some will have pictures. I do want one with a picture, so\nI'll go ahead and choose this one. So now what I'll do for each\nplaceholder, I'll just choose an icon that represents the visual\nchoice, communication, and office. So I'll click here. I'll go for an icon and I'll look for a visual here. Grab this one. Second one refers to choice. So again, we can use the designer\nfor this as well, but we're just going through smart art here. The next one is communication. or communicate. I'll grab this, uh, loudspeaker here. Icons are great. They come in pairs, either have\na filled color or an outline color, which is pretty cool. All right. This one is office. You could use a picture as well, but I'll\njust go ahead and use an office here. And there we go. So here's my smart art graphic. Well, A lot of empty space here. I want to see some big visuals\nand big text, so I'm going to go ahead and change it. So I'll click on the layout options\nhere and I'll just look for some other layouts that incorporates\npictures as well. I'll choose from more layouts. I'll go down to picture and let's see. I'll try. Let's try this one. See what that one looks like. See, this looks a lot better. Now I can go ahead and change\nthe colors if I want to. I can make it colorful. I can also go ahead and give it\na nice intense effect as well. So this is a pretty\nnice smart art graphic. We went from heavy text to\ncreating a nice visual here. We can even take it further and convert it to another\ntype of visual if we want to. So condense your information, convert it to a smart art graphic. We'll get that 65 percent retention. Let's discuss some other\nretention techniques. While you're presenting to your audience,\nyou can actually pull up the whiteboard. You'll notice on the bottom left that\nwe have some tools that we can use. We have things like the laser\npointer, we have the pen as well, but we also have a whiteboard. If you press the W key on your keyboard,\nthat puts us into whiteboard mode. And now we can just use\nthat space to mark up. and maybe collect some, some\nresponses from our audience. There's a lot of different\nthings that we can do. Maybe we can have three columns and\nthen we can just ask our audience. Everyone can raise their hands, right? So here's option A, option\nB, and then option C. So for option A, maybe\nwe had five responses. Option B, maybe three, and then\nmaybe option C is the winner. where we had 10 responses. So that's a simple use of the\nwhiteboard and PowerPoint. So just press the W key on your keyboard. That puts us into whiteboard mode. Now, if you're using\nother apps like Teams, Teams actually has its\nown built in whiteboard. As a matter of fact, there are\nseveral different types of whiteboards that you can use from mind maps\nand other things there as well. Now, Another really cool feature\nin Teams, we actually have what's called PowerPoint live. So check out PowerPoint live. So this basically allows us to share\nour PowerPoint presentation with our audience and it's interactive. So our audience can pretty\nmuch navigate through their presentation at their own speed. They can always come back to where\nthe presenter is actually at as well. So that is a pretty, pretty nice option. Other applications, they have their own\nversions of whiteboards that you can use. So you can either start with a\nblank whiteboard or you can go ahead and use a built in one. They're all really, really good options\nfor interacting with your audience. Now I'll go ahead and press the W\nkey to get rid of my whiteboard here. Let's go ahead and talk\nabout another thing. So we actually have the\ncapability to add forms. Forms is a really great way to\ninteract with your audience. I'll go ahead and end my\nslideshow here and I'll go ahead and click on the insert tab. Now you'll notice when you click on\nthe insert tab, We can insert a form. We can even take it a step further. If you use Power BI, you want to\nshare a visual, you can insert Power BI into here as well. But for now, I want to\ngo ahead and use Forms. It's a great way to collect\ndata from your audience. It automatically connects to\nthe forms that I've created from the Microsoft Forms app. I'll go ahead and insert\nthis PowerPoint form here. So it's asking me, do I want to collect\nresponses offline or do I want to present for interactive meetings? Well, I want to see real time feedback. So I'll go ahead and choose this option. So my form is loading right here\ninside of my PowerPoint slide and we can see this is how it looks. So this is pretty nice. It comes with the QR code. We can also copy and paste the link. So different ways for us to be\nable to engage with our audience. Over here on, I'll go ahead and show\nyou, this is what the form looks like. So I'll be filling out the form. So I'll go ahead and click on start now. I'll put in my name and my\nfavorite feature in PowerPoint. So there are different types of responses. So this one is going to be a word cloud. So I'll say smart art and ideal amount of slides\nin the presentation. I'll say 12. We'll go ahead and submit the form. And it should show up. There you go. So we can see the first response is Mo. I'll go ahead and put this\ninto full screen mode here. And as a matter of fact, I'll go\ninto, I can close this out and I'll go into presentation mode. I'll go to reading view to keep it simple. So this is pretty nice. So as everyone starts entering the\nform, you'll see the information here. If I click on the next response\nhere, I can see smart art. I'll go ahead and add another response. to see how that's collected. So I just added another response. So we can see we have two responses\nnow in the word cloud, and we can see that we're collecting. So this is a word cloud. So if we have many participants\nthat write smart art, this will appear bigger than the others. So that's pretty cool. And then of course, the last\nquestion, this is a multiple choice. So 50 percent says 12, 50 percent says 18. I can change it to a bar down\nhere on the bottom if I want to. We get a nice bar there, or I can also change this to all responses\nto kind of see all of them here as well. So pretty, pretty nice. So those are really two ways\nthat we can engage with our audience and increase retention. Get your audience active, allow\nthem to have some opportunities to participate and to engage as well. So we have. Microsoft Teams Whiteboard. We have Microsoft Teams PowerPoint Live. We have the PowerPoint Whiteboard. We also have Microsoft Forms\nthat we can integrate as well. Let's go ahead and answer\nour third question. Well, what are some of the mistakes\nthat we are going to avoid? Well, some common mistakes that we\nsee in PowerPoint, just to name a few, all the slides look the same. You're expecting the same type of\ndelivery, the same type of, of content, and you're expecting to not be engaged. So we've already seen how we can\novercome some of those issues as well. But some of the common mistakes is not\ntaking our audience into consideration. So we do want to present based on the\naudience that we are presenting to. Now, one of the things that we kind\nof strike out on is our audience is looking for key conclusions. So they want some summaries. They want some insightful data, right? How is this beneficial to me? So when you're building a presentation,\nyou need to consider who is your audience and how will they benefit\nfrom your actual presentation? What are some of the key insights that\nyou want to provide to your audience? We want to provide conclusions\nand not a lot of just random information also looking for insights. So what is the takeaway? What is the benefit? And a really big one here. A lot of times we use PowerPoint\nto present a lot of data, which is very, very difficult to do. So to overcome these, what we want\nto do is if we need to represent data, we do not want to use text. We want to use tables, or you\nwant to use charts as well. Now, one of the things that we can do,\nif we do want to represent some type of data, again, if you're using Power BI, we\ncan insert a Power BI report right here, and that makes it much more efficient\nfor everyone to see the data and be able to interact with the data as well. We can also insert a chart. So we can insert a table. We can insert a chart in here as well. But if you already have an existing\nchart or table in Excel, you can actually just copy and paste\nit right here into PowerPoint. I'm going to go ahead and insert a\nnew slide and I'll change the layout. I just actually, this is fine. I'll put my table and my chart on here. I'll open my Excel. So here's my Excel. I can see I have a table here\nand I also have a chart so I can just copy this chart. And I'm going to paste this chart\nright into this content placeholder and there is our actual chart. Now, if I wanted to add the table in\nhere, I can go ahead and do that as well, but I don't necessarily need the table\nbecause I already have the chart here. I'll go ahead and delete\nthis content placeholder. Now I can make my chart a little bigger. And I am good to go. So let's go ahead and\ncall this sales data. Now, the really nice thing about this\nchart as well is we can actually, you know, create a little bit of intrigue\nhere so we can animate the actual chart. So I'll go ahead and click on\nthe animations tab here and I'll use a simple animation. The chart comes in as one, but what\nI can do is if I click on the effect options, I have a lot of options in here. in terms of the sequence. So I can reveal the chart piece by\npiece, maybe by series or by category or by element in the category. This is super useful if you have\na chart that has a lot of data. You don't want to just present all of\nthe information to your audience at once. You can break it down piece by piece. So I'm going to choose the by series\nand let's see what that looks like. So we can see Q1 comes in first. And then Q2 comes in second, and\nthen the total line comes in third. It's also interactive. So if you move your mouse over it,\nit shows you the actual numbers. I'll choose the next one by category. So it comes in the first cluster. Here's M Jones, Q1, Q2 in total, and\nthen Cohen and then Sanchez and Gupta. The next one here is\nby element and series. So it's Q1 for each and then Q2. and then the total. So that is pretty cool. So we can go ahead and just\nkind of animate our chart. We can pause before we move on there. And then finally we have\nby element and category. So it's just literally going\nfrom left to right one by one. I think I like by element in the series. I'll go ahead and choose that one. I'll go into, I'll go into reading view. Let's see what that looks like. So here's my chart. And on each click, I can reveal a\nQ1 for Jones, Cohen, Sanchez, Gupta. Now we're in quarter two. And then we have our totals as well. So we can animate our chart. We can also animate our smart art as well. So pretty, pretty cool. Another mistake is not\nusing the presenter view. The presenter view is a really,\nreally good option here. I'll go ahead and click on slideshow\nand I'll go ahead and make sure that I have presenter view turned on. And I want to show my\npresentation on my other monitor. I want this current screen\nto show my presenter view. So the presenter view comes with a\nlot of really, really nice tools. We can use subtitles if you\nwant to, and that's very, very helpful for our audience. I'll go ahead and turn those on. We can always turn those off later. And we have the different settings\nhere that we can set as well. I'll go ahead and run my presentation. So I'll go ahead and\nfrom this current slide. So here's the actual presenter view. We can see on the bottom, it's actually\ntranslating my speech into text. So that's very, very\nhelpful for our audience. I'll go ahead and turn that off. I'll just click on toggle subtitles here. So this is really nice. The presenter view allows us to do\nsome really, really nice things. But overall, it allows\nus to own our content. Because the presenter view,\nwe can see this window. The only thing that our audience can\nsee is what's inside of this frame. So I'm on my other screen. They can only see whatever\nis being presented in here. They cannot see all of my\ntools down here that I have. They cannot see the notes for my slide. And also once I go back, we\ncan see that we can see what, what slide is coming next. So this is a really,\nreally nice tool for us. It helps us to own our content. Well, what does that mean? Well, we're in control. We can see what's coming next. We can see the slide that's coming next. We can see the animations\nthat are coming next. For example, if I go back here, I can see that my chart is\ngoing to be displayed next. If I click here and I can see the\nanimations before they come up. So when you have a lot of detail on\nyour slide, it's pretty difficult to remember the sequence of events. So the presenter view allows\nus to take control of that. Now for each of the\nslides, we have our notes. So now notice I only have three graphics\nin here, but here are my talking points. I can use my notes for my talking points. So this way I'm not reading\nnecessarily what's on my slide. I'm just giving context to\nwhat's on my slide here as well. All right, so I can say, well, what\nwe can do is copy and paste tables. from Excel or other applications. We want to use animations in a clever\nway by breaking down our content and we want to keep it concise. So we want to try to stick\nthe three concepts per slide. Well, why three concepts? Well, because our brain naturally\nunderstands things in threes, breakfast, lunch, dinner, right? Morning, afternoon, night. So the presenter view allows\nus to own our content. The notes area allows us to provide\ntalking points for each of our slides so that we were just summarizing the\nslide instead of reading everything that's on our slide as well. And then of course, when we're\nusing the presenter view, it helps us to keep the slide simple. We can add our contents in our notes. And that way it's not\noverloading our slides as well. Now in here, we have a lot of\nother tools that we can use. Sometimes you want to be able\nto navigate to another slide. If I click here, my audience\nis still seeing this slide. They're not seeing my,\nmy slide layouts here. I can go ahead and just jump to another\nslide if I want to, and I'm good to go. Some other things that we can do, so we\ncan go ahead and black out the screen. And we have a lot of different things\nin here that we can use as well. So definitely use the presenter\nview because it gives us some really, really nice benefits. Helps you own your content. Now when you own your content, your\naudience will have more confidence in you and they'll be more engaged\nbecause you own your content. When you're summarizing your slides\ninstead of reading it verbatim, that also increases retention. And when you're keeping\nyour slides simple. Keeping it to three concepts per slide,\nyou're helping out your audience as well. For Module 2, we have a few questions\nthat we want to ask as well. We have three questions,\njust like Module 1. The first question that we want to ask\nis, well, what do we want to customize? The second question is, what layout\nconcepts do we want to create? And third, which new tool\nwould we like to use? So a lot of this will\nbe about customizations. We'll take a deeper dive\ninto the slide master. What do we want to customize? Well, let's go ahead and make\nour own theme and then we'll go ahead and customize some of the\nexisting layouts that we have here. And we can also make consistent changes. to our presentation. So to customize the theme, so I\ncan click on the design tab and I can choose one of these themes. So basically what is the theme? It's a set of colors, fonts, and effects. So all these different themes,\nthey have their own set of colors, their fonts, and effects as well. Well, what if I wanted to go ahead\nand maybe brand my PowerPoint? I can go ahead and do that. Or maybe I'm just not. You know, I just don't want to\nuse any of these existing themes. Well, let's make our own. I'll click on the view tab and then\nI'll head on over to the slide master. And this is where I can make all\nkinds of changes to my presentation. But for now, let's just\ngo ahead and make a theme. If I scroll to the top, I'll see that\nthis slide, make sure to click on there. So this is the actual master slide. So notice that they're Significantly\nlarger than the others. These are the different layouts. For example, here's the title slide,\ntitle and content, to content. I'll click on that slide\nhere on the very, very top. Once I'm in the slide master, there's\na lot of things that we can do. We'll explore, but for now, what\nwe want to do is we want to go ahead and choose a set of colors. a font and effects for\nour entire presentation. We can even go ahead and\nchange the background styles. So instead of choosing one of\nthese existing themes, I'm going to go ahead and make my own. So I'll choose a color palette here. Now notice you can actually make\nyour own color palette as well. So here's some different\ncolors that we can make. I'll go ahead and scroll down. So here's the newer office theme. Here's the older office theme. So maybe I just want\nsomething like a blue green. I'll go ahead and choose blue green here. And I'll go ahead and choose my fonts. So maybe I'll go for,\nlet's see, I'll go for the font and for the effects. I like a glossy effect. So that's it. I've chosen my color palette. I've chosen my font. And I've chosen my effects here as well. If I click on the fonts drop down,\nI can go ahead and customize the fonts and I can basically specify\nwhat I want my headings to look like and what the body to look like. So I can actually change the headings\nif I want to do something else. Maybe I'll make this, let's see, not the\nbest menu to kind of scroll through here. I'll go for Georgia. for my headings, and I have\nGaramond here for my body. I'll go ahead and press save, and I'll\nclose the master view to kind of see what that looks like, just to confirm. So I can see I now have the Georgia\nfont for all of my headings and titles, and I have the Garamond here. So mission accomplished. So I'll go back into the slide master, and\nI want to go ahead and save this theme. So I'll go ahead and click\non the themes drop down here. And on the very, very bottom,\nI'll click on save current theme and I'll just call this one Garamond and Georgia. I'll go ahead and press save\nand I'm good to go. So that's how we make our own theme. I'll close the master view. And now if I were to open\nup a new PowerPoint file and I click on the design tab. I'll see, I should be able to find that. So it's right here. It's the Garamond and Georgia theme. So that's how we can make\nour own theme in PowerPoint. Let's go ahead and customize\nthe existing layouts. So many of us do this, you know, we'll\ncome here and we'll change the font color. We'll change the font size. We'll come in here and change\nthe type of bullets as well. And then we'll go to the next slide and\nwe'll do the same thing there again. Well, we don't have to do that. Let's go ahead and customize the existing\nlayouts here so that we can have a uniform font, color, size, effect and maybe we\nwant the check marks here for our bullets instead of the original bullet points. I'll click on the View tab. I'll head on over back\nto the Slide Master. Now the current layout that\nI have selected, this is the title and content layout. So if I make any changes to that layout,\nall of my slides that are title and content will inherit these changes. So I'll go click on the slide master here. If I scroll up here, so notice\nthat I'm currently on the title and the content layout. If I hover over it, it tells me that\nit's being used by slides two through 11. So all those slides, 2 through 11,\nis going to inherit any changes that I make to the layout here. I'll keep it simple. I'll just go ahead and\nclick on the title here. And I'll make this a blue color. I'll make it bold as well. Now, for the first, uh, I'll go\nahead and change my list here. So I'll change these to check marks\ninstead of those basic bullets. I'll also go ahead and\nclick on that first line. I'll make that another color as well. I don't have a lot of colors to choose\nfrom, just some basic colors here. So maybe I'll go for the darker, different shade of blue. I'll go for this one. And that's it. So I'll go ahead and close the\nmaster view and let's see if that will affect that layout. And there we go. So we can see slides 2 through\n11, they have all inherited the changes that I've made\nto that layout here as well. So that looks pretty good. But maybe I want something else\nlike a little accent down here. I'll go back into the slide master and\nI'll go ahead and insert a basic shape. I'll just put a little accent down here, something like that. I can also remove the Footers\ndon't need those right now. So just a nice little accent down here. And let's see what that looks like. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And there we go. So all of my layouts, title and content\nlayout now has those changes that I made to the title, the bullets. And now I have my little\naccent in here as well. Maybe I'll change that accent. Let's see what other\ncolors I have available. Not a lot, because again, this, this\nwas a pretty, not a lot of colors. I'll go for something that\ngives a little bit of contrast. Let's see what that looks like. It looks a little better. So there we go. So that's how we can go ahead\nand customize the layouts. When it comes to customizing what we\nwant, we can see that the slide master allows us to customize our own theme. We can customize existing layouts to\nmake universal changes to all of the slides that has that particular layout. And we were able to make some\nconsistent changes as well, such as specifying the name of the font for\nour headings and the font for the body. of our slides as well. But let's answer the next question. So what layout concepts\ndo we want to create? Now we did talk a little bit in\nmodule one about the rule of three. So basically the rule of three,\nwe want to keep everything simple. I want to keep it to about\nthree concepts per slide. Again, because we naturally understand\nthings in threes, breakfast, lunch, dinner, morning, noon, and night. So if we can go ahead and just kind\nof keep everything to three, then we'll be helping our audience out. So I'll go ahead and head\non over to the slide master. I'll click on the view tab. And, but before I do that, if I click\non the dropdown here for new slides, I can see that I have title and content. I have two content and I have comparison,\nbut I don't have one that has three. content. So I'll click on the view tab. I'll go back to the slide master. Now I have two options. I can go ahead and duplicate this\nslide and then just go ahead and add two more content placeholders\nand just kind of align them. So I can do that. I'll have less work to do that way. Or what I can do So I can actually just\ngo ahead and insert a new layout and that will allow me to pretty much position\neverything in the way that I want to. Let's go ahead and do both. I'll go ahead and duplicate\nthis title and content layout. Here it is. I want to rename it. I'll just call this one three columns. And what I'll do is I'll just\ngo ahead and reduce the width of this current placeholder. I'll click on the shape format here. I want it to be about 3. 3. So I'll put it there and I'll\nalign it to the far left. Or actually what I'll do is\nI'll align it to the middle. And then my others will be based\non the position of this one. So I'll go ahead and insert a\nplaceholder so I can be very specific just for text, just for picture, chart. Well, I want content. I want to be able to\ninsert anything there. So I'll go ahead and draw this one here. And I'll just make sure\nit's the same width, 3. 3, same height. Good to go. I'll align this one to the left. Alright, one more to go. Just use those temporary guidelines. And I'll align this all\nthe way to the right. So there we go. So there is our three content layout. Now I do want to go ahead\nand center align the title. So I'll center align that. I can see right now that I have check\nmarks here for bullets, but I have the regular bullets for my others. Remember, we're editing\nan existing layout. So I'll just go ahead and change\nthe bullets, keep them consistent. So I'll go for the check marks here. And the check marks here. Good to go. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And let's go ahead and insert that slide. I'll click on new. Here is my three column layout. And there he goes. Now I have three content placeholders. I can add an image,\nicons, anything I want to. And these here as well. So this will be my three column layout. I'll go ahead and just\nadd some detail in here. Let's see. I'll go for a quick chart. I'll just go with the defaults. So there's my chart right there. And that first content\nplaceholder, uh, over here, I'll go for, I'll go for an icon. I'll go for a chart as well. Great. Icons don't really fit inside\nof our content placeholders. So we just need to kind of\nmake them a little bigger. And then over here I can go\nahead and insert, uh, let's see, I'll insert a stock image. There we go. That one fit really nicely here. So that is how we can create\nour own three column layout. Let's go ahead and\ncreate another one here. I'll go back to my view tab. I'll go back to the slide master. And now what I want to do is I want\nto go ahead and insert another layout. All right, so I'll click on insert layout. And this one will also be, I'll have\nthree concepts in here, but I just want to move things around here. So I'm going to go ahead and move\nmy title over here like that. And also, just make\nsure that it's centered. And I'll click on the shape format. And, let's see, I'll go\nback to the home tab. And I want to make sure the\ntext is aligned to the middle. So I'm good to go there. Alright, so there is my text. I do want to change the color, so\nI'll make it that nice dark brown. blue here or a little darker blue. I'll go for that. So I want to go ahead and\ninsert three content layouts. This time it will be a little different. I'll go ahead and add, kind\nof stack them like this. So it's going to be one\ncolumn, but three rows. So I'll go ahead and go\nback to the slide master. I'll insert a placeholder\nand I'll just go for content. So same as I did before, I'll\ngo ahead and draw this out. I'll use my footers on the bottom\nas a guide, in terms of the width, and we're good to go. Right now, I'll make the height\ntwo inches, and then I'll go ahead and repeat that process here. So, two more placeholders, same width and height, there we go, and then one more to go, and So there we go. So that's a pretty nice layout as well. I do want to fix this though. I'll move this up just a\nlittle bit right there. And that looks pretty good. I'll go ahead and rename this one. So I'll rename the layout and\nI'll call this one one by three. Right, so one column, three rows, and\nI'll go ahead and click on rename. I could change the bullets here as well\nif I want to, but I'll leave them for now. And I'll go ahead and close\nthe master view and I'll go ahead and insert that layout. So here's my one by three. So pretty cool. Now I can go ahead and do the same thing. Let's see if I can convert this\none to the other layout here. So if I change the layout of this\nexisting one to one by three. So, did a pretty good job, right? So, just kind of use the existing\nplaceholders and stack them. But, um, I would need a wider picture\nto take advantage of this placeholder. My chart is okay. And I can go ahead and just, um, enlarge\nsome of these other items here as well. So, pretty, pretty cool. Let's go ahead and create a clean slide. We'll continue the concept\nof the rule of three. Another concept of the rule of three\nhelps us to create clean slides. We'll take a look at the rule of thirds. So the rule of thirds is\npretty popular and prevalent in photography and filmmaking as well. So how can we apply the rule of\nthirds to our presentation here? I'll go ahead and insert a blank slide. And then what I'll do is I'll go\nahead and turn on the, the grid lines. So I'll click on the view tab and\nI want to turn on the, the guides first of all, and then I'll turn on\nthe grid lines and the ruler as well. So if I turn the guides on, this\ngives me the, the vertical guide here and the horizontal guide. I can actually add more guides\nif I want to, which I'll, I'll do that in just a little bit. Here is the ruler. So the ruler shows me where I\nam horizontally and vertically. So right now, I am on the three\nhorizontally and two vertically. Well, what the rule of thirds\nsays is that when you have a frame, you want to go ahead and\ndivide it into, into three, right? So we want three rows and three columns. So if I were to draw a line, let's\nsay right here, This is not exact. We'll, we'll get the exacts\nin just a little bit here. So I'll go ahead and\njust put two lines here. So we now have three columns,\nbut we also want three rows. I'll go ahead and draw another line here. I'll go ahead and draw\nanother one down here as well. So now we have three rows\nand we have three columns. The intersection of these different\npoints here So these four points, guess what these are called? These are actually called PowerPoints. So these are actual PowerPoints. And what the rule of thirds says is\nthat when we align our objects on those points, then it's a great way\nto design our slides and to just capture our audience's attention. visually. So that's the idea behind\nthe rule of thirds. So if I have an object, I want to\nmake sure to place that object, right? So if I have three objects on this\nslide, have one here, have one here, and maybe the big one here. So that's a more natural kind of\nlayout to capture our attention. So that is the concept\nof the rule of thirds. So we need to go ahead and just\nidentify those different points. As you can see, did a pretty good\njob in terms of the columns here, but my rows are too spaced out. So let's go ahead and establish where\nthose PowerPoints are on our canvas. I'll keep it simple. I'll go ahead and add a guideline here. at the two and a half mark\nhorizontally on each side. So two and a half on each. And then we'll go for a one\nand a half on the vertical. So I'll go ahead and insert a guideline. So I'll right click here and\nI'll add a vertical guide. And I can move this over to\nthe two and a half right there. Go ahead and add another one. Another vertical guide. I'll move this one over here\nto two and a half as well. And then I'll go ahead and\nadd my two horizontal guides. This one will be at 1. 5 and the other one will be at 1. 5 here as well. So by doing that I could go ahead\nand highlight my PowerPoints. Here's one. Here's two. It's not exact. But here we go. So here are our four PowerPoints. So just turning on those grid\nlines, and now if I go to any slide, I can see those grid lines. So now I can leave them turned on,\nand I can go ahead and just make sure that I'm aligning my different\nobjects to those PowerPoints as well. So that's how we can set up our\nslides for the rule of three. And then we can actually create a\nlayout that has content placeholders on these four different PowerPoints. Now, here's an example of putting the\nrule of thirds into practice here. I have three objects here on\nmy slide, and this is typically how we see them laid out. We always have on the top, we\nalways, always have our placeholder, and then we'll have our content\nplaceholder, and then we'll have another one here to the left. But, I want to go ahead and\napply the rule of thirds. So I'll move my picture\nhere on the PowerPoints. I'll actually increase\nthe size of the picture. I'll place that right\nhere on my PowerPoints. And for this one here, I'll\nplace this on the PowerPoint down here on the bottom right. And for this one, it\ndoesn't need to be that big. I'll go ahead and resize this one and\nI'll place this on this PowerPoint. I'll go ahead and increase\nthe font size here. Make sure they're consistent. And I'll just go ahead and do that. So I'll go ahead and turn off my grid\nlines here, my guides and my ruler. And if we take a look at this particular\nlayout, we can see that this makes a lot more sense because I've placed\nthem on the actual PowerPoints. Just need to align them here a little bit. And this looks much more balanced\nthan the traditional, you know, title content here and all of this\nempty space over here as well. So this is a really, really nice concept. Again, just identifying those PowerPoints\nand aligning our objects on those PowerPoints helps us to really create\nreally nice and balanced slides. Let's create a reusable slide. Now, if I click on my new slide here,\nI can see that the slides that we've created so far, we have layouts in here. So we have the different\ncontent placeholders and they're laid out in different ways. But in this case, what I want to\ndo is create a reusable slide. So it will have the layout. It will also have the\ncontents in there as well. I want to create a custom title slide. Now, I did use the designer. I just added a title and a subtitle,\ninserted a picture here, and the designer kind of gave me some pretty nice ideas. These are what the modern\ntitle slides look like. They incorporate pictures. We have our text and we have some little\naccents in here, some little shapes. For example, for this particular one. So here's our picture. We can see that the picture is in a frame. So that's one of the\npicture styles that we used. It's overlaying an actual rectangle\nshape that has that grayish fill color. Over here to the left, this is either\nan image or three individual rectangles with that gray shape here as well. And then of course we have our\ncontent placeholder for the title and the subtitle as well. So that's pretty much what that is. Whenever you add an object like an\nimage, a shape, or an icon to the Slide Master, it gets locked onto the canvas. So notice I cannot interact\nwith these different shapes. I can interact with this picture\nbecause I inserted that picture. But all of these here are just our basics. Remember when I inserted this\nlittle accent down here for all of my title and content placeholders? Just a little shape. We cannot interact with it. So I want to go ahead and insert\na custom title slide because they don't all have to look like this. Let's surprise our audience by\nproviding them with a really, really nice opening slide. I'll click on the view tab. I'll go to the slide master and I want\nto go ahead and insert a new layout. So I'll click on insert layout here. And I'll go ahead and\nrename this right away. This is going to be Title 2. There we go. I'll go ahead and hide the\ntitle and the footers for now. I can bring them back later. And I'll go ahead and look\nfor a really nice picture. Now, I'll have a couple of\noptions when I insert my picture. I can either choose a picture that will\ntake up the top two thirds of the slide, and then down here I can have my title. title, my subtitle, maybe even\nmy, my logo down here somewhere. Or I can go for a more of\na two column orientation. Maybe the You. Left two thirds and then a third column\nright, I'll have my title, subtitle, and then maybe my logo down here. So it all depends on the dimensions of\nthe picture that I, that I get here. So I'll look for a really nice picture. I'll click on the, the insert tab here. I'll look for pictures. I'll grab a stock image. And once I find the picture, I'll\ngo ahead and start working with it. So I have my picture here, go\nahead and align this to the left. Now with this picture is pretty big. So what I can do is I can\ngo ahead and get some ideas. I can either crop this to a shape\nto kind of get an idea here. So that's one thing that I can do. I can crop it to a shape, give\nit a nice modern look and feel. I'll go ahead and undo that. I can also crop it to a particular ratio. So if I wanted this to be more of\n16 by 9, it will crop it for me and offer me that 16 by 9 ratio. It actually looks pretty good. I don't need much of the detail that's\nat the bottom of the picture here. So I'll go ahead and leave it like that. So at this point, it's\nstill taking up a lot. I would need to kind of trim it\nso that I can at least see the one third of the right column there. So what else can I do? Well, I can probably crop some of\nthe detail over here on the left. So go ahead and do that. Don't want to crop too much though,\nbecause I do want to catch some of these nice colors from that, that monitor. So let's see, I'll align\nthis to the center. Now I can use one of the, I can put\nthis in the frame, maybe like that. Right, then I'll go ahead and\njust insert a basic shape. So I'll go for a rectangle. I'll put that over here, just\nto kind of fill out that space. I'll send it to the back, so\nmy picture's overlaid on it. And for that rectangle, I can give it\na, give it its own formatting here. So, what a nice contrast. So I'll go for that. That looks pretty good so far and\nnow I can go ahead and return my title and so here's my title and\nnow I can put that over here like that I want to make sure it's center\naligned so I'll center it and make it a little smaller doesn't need to be\nthat big so 40 and as far as the color I can leave the color as is right now\nor I can use the eyedropper to pick up one of the colors from inside of here. I think that's what I want to do,\nor maybe I'll just go with this nice blue, dark blue over here. Not the color I was looking for. Let's see. I'll go for this one. I'll insert another\nplaceholder here for text. This will be for my subtitle. I'll get rid of the bullets. And I'll also delete the second,\nthird, fourth, and fifth levels. I'll go ahead and center\nalign this as well. And, um, at this point it's just\na matter of what color do I want and what size do I want this to be. So 28, that's perfectly fine. And let's see what other\ncolors I have here. Let's see if I can pick up one\nof the colors from the picture. Maybe Let's see. I'll go for There's a white background. I'll go for this one. Not too much. I need a better contrast. For now, I'll just leave it as black. Right, and I'm good to go. So there is my custom slide. I'll go ahead and make sure\nthis is renamed properly. Title 2. There we go. I'll go ahead and close the master view. And I'll go ahead and insert that\nnew slide so we can see here it is, has the content in there already. There we go. So that's a pretty nice\nlooking title slide. And I'll just say present like a pro and I'll just say learn with us. So there we go. So pretty nice. So that's how we can\ncreate a reusable slide. Now, if I want to make any other\nchanges to this, I can, I can just go back into the slide master. Maybe I'll change the color of this one. Maybe I can go ahead and add\na logo down here as well. I'll go back into the Slide Master. I'm going to go ahead and\ninsert just a basic logo here. I'll go for this. I'll go ahead and make that really small. I'll just put it down here. Make sure it's centered. Yeah, I have that gray\nbackground in there. Maybe I'll change the background. And I'm good to go. Once I close the master view, I can\nsee that that slide has been updated. Let's take a look at a few tips\nand or some of the newer features that are available in PowerPoint. If we click on the review tab, we\nhave the check accessibility and if we click on the slide show, we\nhave the rehearse with coach option. These are two tools that will run,\nthey'll analyze your presentation for you and provide you with some feedback. We also have the high contrast\nmode that's available. I'll start with the high\ncontrast mode first. It will be available depending\non the type of colors in the background that you're working with. I'll go back to the home tab here. I'll click inside of\nmy content placeholder. Now I do have a I do want to change\nthe color of the content placeholder. So if I click on the shape format\nhere, I can change the shape fill. And typically we're dealing\nwith, we can change the color to an existing theme color. But the newer feature allows us\nto choose only colors that may be easier for others to read. So I can turn on high contrast here, and\nnow we can see it just kind of filters out the colors that will look pretty,\nthat will work well with this background. So I can go ahead and apply one\nof these and I'll be good to go. So at this point, I don't\nhave that much to choose from. I'll go ahead and choose\nthis blue accent six. We can see that works pretty\nwell with this background here as well, and I'm good to go. As far as the text, let's see if\nI were to highlight this chunk of text here, let's see if I have\nthe, so I do have the high contrast available for the text here as well. Now that I've changed\nthe background color. And so it's telling me\nthat this color works well. So these are all the colors that will\nwork well with that particular background because they are high contrast. Notice at the bottom, we\neven have additional colors that we can use here as well. So that's a really, really nice tool, a\nbig help when it comes to just selecting the right colors in our presentation. It's not always available. For example, let's see if it\nwill be available here, right? So it's not always available. It's only available for\nnon transparent colors. So that is a pretty nice option. So the next time you're choosing\nyour font or you're changing the color of an object, go ahead and\nturn on the high contrast only. The other tool that we can take a\nlook at is the Accessibility Tool. Now, if I click on the Review tab,\nhere is the Check Accessibility Tool. And this is a pretty nice tool. It offers a lot of insight\nand provides a lot of feedback and a lot of fixes as well. I'll go ahead and click\non the Accessibility here. If you hover over it, it tells\nyou exactly what it does. What it does, it says, let's\nmake sure that your file follows accessibility best practices and it'll\nhelp us fix issues along the way. So I'll click here. It opens up the pane over\nhere to the, to the right. So a lot of the feedback that\nwe'll see here is things that are missing for screen readers. Now, typically what I like to do\nin here is look for any errors. text that's hard to read. So any kind of color contrast\nis difficult to read. I don't have any right now, which is good. So that means for my entire presentation,\nall the text can be read easily. So if I click here, it says\nmissing alternative text. If I click here, it brings me right to\nthat place in my actual presentation. So I don't have a caption\nfor this shape here. And the screen reader is going to try to\nfigure out exactly what this shape is. So what I can do is go ahead\nand add a description here, the recommended actions, right? Or I can just mark it as decorative. So I can go ahead and do that. If I go ahead and click\non another item here. So I'll go ahead and add a description\nand I'll just say a horizontal line and I'm good to go. Right. So, then we have the reading order. This is basically telling us that we\nneed to go, I'm missing the title. So that's why it's\ngiving me an issue here. So I can verify the order in which\nit actually appears here as well. But what I want to do, I'm going\nto go ahead and purposely create a hard to read text contrast here. Let's see. I'll go for another color. I'll change the background, actually. Change this to, let's say, here we go. So we finally triggered it,\nshowing us that we have hard to read, uh, text contrast. So if I click here, it brings\nme right to that place. If I go to another slide, if I\nclick here, brings me right to that slide and it's giving me recommended\nactions to change the font color or to change the fill color. So, if I do something like change the fill\ncolor to, let's say, black, it's corrected and so it disappears from here as well. So that is the Accessibility Checker,\num, a lot of really robust features, but those are the basics of how\nthe Accessibility Checker works. If you are creating presentations\nand you're distributing them, you want to make sure that you\nrun the Accessibility Checker. to check all these errors and\ncorrect them here as well. Let's take a look at one more tool,\nand this is a really nice tool. It's the Rehearse with Coach tool. I'll click on my slideshow tab\nhere, and I'll go ahead and click on Rehearse with Coach. The rehearse with coach will\ngive us real time feedback. So this allows us to rehearse with\nthe built in PowerPoint coach. We will receive a detailed report giving\nus constructive criticism and feedback. So it's like rehearsing with a colleague\nand they're giving you feedback. I'll head on over to my first\nslide and I'll just cover the first couple of slides. I'm not going to cover the\nentire presentation here. I'll just cover the first\nMaybe four or five slides here. I'll click on Rehearsal of Coach. Here we go. It's going to show me real time feedback\nI'll go ahead and start rehearsing Welcome to PowerPoint tips\nfor amazing presentations If you want to present like a pro\nmake sure to come and learn with us In module one, we'll answer three questions And once we answer those You\nThree different questions. We'll take a deeper\ndive into them as well. First, we want to talk about\nthe concept of storytelling. So what story do you want to tell? The main concept of storytelling is being\nable to add structure to our outline and adding slides for additional context. Storytelling takes our\naudience on a journey. And it also increases engagement\nbecause we are providing structure to our presentation. Now, what retention\ntechniques will be used? It depends on what the science says. And based on that, we can\ngather some insight in terms of how to increase retention. When it comes to retention, it's all\nabout, well, what do we remember? How much are we retaining? And what opportunities will we\npresent, provide our audience with text, speech, visuals, or all three? Here are some of the common\nmistakes that we want to avoid. Pretty much too much content. We want to condense content\nas much as possible. and use our notes as talking\npoints for our individual slides. So I'll press the escape key there\njust to kind of take a look and see. So here's the actual report that pops up. So we can see it's pretty exhaustive. So it gives me a summary. The amount of slides I\nrehearsed, the total time. I did not use any filler words\nlike um, and okay, and actually. No repetitive language. So I used a variety of word choice. That was pretty good. Uh, inclusiveness, my pace is just right. So 132 words per minute. So this is a really, really nice tool. So I highly encourage you to make\nuse of this tool before you present. You can practice over and over. Um, you can click on rehearse\nagain, and you can really nail down your presentation, right? Originality, I avoided reading\nthe text out loud on my slides. Right. So again, this is a huge tip right here. So the rehearsal coach gives us some\nreally nice feedback and allows us to implement some of the tips that\nwe've talked about here as well. Right. My pitch got a little low, so I\nneed to pick that up a little bit. I've been talking a lot, losing my voice,\nbut I need to go ahead and pick that up just a little bit here and I'm good to go. So that is the rehearse with coach tool. Let's take a look at some other tips here. We did kind of mention them, but\nhere, one of the first tips is that bullets have their own rules. So when you're working with bullets on\nyour slide, three bullets are ideal, four is okay, five may be a bit much. Also want to make sure that you\nkeep bulleted items on one line. We do not want to wrap\nthem to another line. So, so that means we need to\ncondense the information that we're providing to our audience. Also, when it comes to font size, the\nminimum font size should be around 20. There are different professionals\nthat have different opinions on this, but in my experience, at least 20,\nanything smaller than 20 will be very, very difficult to see depending on\nthe type of display that's being used. Keep in mind that some\nfonts are naturally taller. and wider than others. And some are actually thinner\nand shorter than others as well. So depending on the type of font that\nyou see, you select, you may need to go ahead and make it even larger than 20 in\norder to be able to see them properly. And then use the eyedropper. Eyedropper is a really, really nice tool. It allows you to keep\nthe color scheme uniform. So you can use the eyedropper for text. You can use it for shapes, text boxes,\nand even content placeholders as well. So use all those tips and we'll be\nable to really create some really nice, engaging and dynamic presentations. Let's recap our learning together here. We want to be able to tell a\nstory for our presentation. We want to prepare for engagement and\nretention using some of the techniques that we learn through this course. We want to avoid common mistakes, mainly\nproviding too much content on a slide. We also want to be able to customize\nour presentation efficiently by using the Slide Master. Saving a lot of time by\nmaking universal changes. We also want to create the appropriate\nlayouts that works best for our audience and what we're trying to communicate and\nhow we're trying to communicate as well. And then make sure to utilize the\nnewer tools that are available and feel free to always check out what's new. Maybe there is a new tool that was not\ndiscussed for this course here as well."
