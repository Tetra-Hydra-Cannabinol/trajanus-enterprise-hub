0:00 using shapes in charts can create more
0:02 interest and give them infographic
0:04 styling there's no limit to the type of
0:06 shapes you can work with but there are
0:08 some techniques required to ensure they
0:10 don't get distorted when working with
0:12 data of different values I'll build the
0:15 red chart first and it starts by
0:18 inserting a regular column chart so I'm
0:21 just selecting my data insert and then
0:24 2D column chart let's bring it over
0:27 closer to the data first thing I want to
0:29 do is make the columns a bit wider so
0:31 contrl one to open the formatting pane
0:34 mine's removed from the dock so it's
0:36 sitting beside my chart just makes it
0:39 easier for us to see together so change
0:41 the Gap width to
0:42 50% and I'll close that pain for now the
0:46 next thing I want to do is insert the
0:47 shape I want to use insert shapes and
0:51 then I want a pointed colum so I'm going
0:54 to use the arrow and then I'm just going
0:58 to change the formatting of the arrow so
1:02 it's a pointed column you want the shape
1:04 to be roughly the same size as your
1:07 tallest
1:09 column and I want to remove the outline
1:12 on the Arrow to match that of my column
1:15 so with my shape drawn on select it crl
1:18 C to copy select the series just one
1:21 left click and contrl V to paste now you
1:24 need to be careful of the shape you
1:25 choose because it will be stretched to
1:27 fit the different column sizes in this
1:29 chart it's barely noticeable but you can
1:31 see that column C is more pointy than
1:35 column e and as you change the size of
1:38 the chart that Distortion will become
1:41 more or less noticeable now we can do
1:43 some more things to tidy up this chart
1:46 for example let's add data labels and
1:49 now that we have those I don't need my
1:51 vertical axis or the grid lines let's
1:55 format them to make them a bit bigger
1:58 and we'll match the color of the label
2:00 to that of the column now you might want
2:02 to go one shade darker than the actual
2:04 column when you're formatting text
2:06 because it makes it just slightly easier
2:08 to read and it's hardly noticeable in
2:11 the chart
2:12 itself I'll turn off my chart title you
2:15 might want one here but this is just
2:16 dummy data I'll also format my
2:19 horizontal axis labels in the same
2:21 orange and let's make the font a bit
2:24 bigger now if you're going to be putting
2:26 this into a larger infographic style
2:28 report you might want to remove the
2:31 border on your chart so with it's
2:33 selected just choose no outline and
2:36 there you have a very Sleek looking
2:38 chart it has that infographic look to
2:41 it now we can use multiple shapes to
2:44 create a more interesting shape for
2:46 example this chart has Circle shapes at
2:48 the top of the columns and this requires
2:50 a little bit more setup so that the
2:51 shapes don't become distorted when your
2:53 chart has different size columns so let
2:56 me move that out of the way we'll start
2:58 by splitting the values into the the
2:59 column portion and the circle
3:02 portion now I know that the circle
3:05 portion should be roughly
3:07 15 and that makes the column portion the
3:11 value minus the circle portion you can
3:14 play with this value once you insert
3:16 your chart to get it just right now to
3:19 insert my stacked column chart which is
3:21 what I need when I have multiple shapes
3:24 is to select just the data I want in my
3:26 chart insert and then 2D stacked column
3:31 let's bring it over closer to the data
3:33 again I'm going to control one and
3:35 change the Gap width to just 50% and now
3:39 I can go ahead and insert the shapes I
3:41 want to use so insert the first thing I
3:44 want is a circle and I'm just going to
3:46 hold down shift while I draw it and that
3:48 ensures that the circle remains
3:51 perfectly rounded it doesn't turn into
3:53 an oval now if I copy and paste that
3:55 Circle onto The Circle Series you'll see
3:58 it's missing the part part that joins it
4:00 to the column so let's contrl Zed to
4:02 undo that and we'll insert the second
4:04 shape which will be the rectangle this
4:06 needs to be the same width as the circle
4:09 so you can use the height and width
4:11 tools up here to get it just right so if
4:13 it's 1.61 wide this needs to be 1.61
4:17 wide and it is that rarely happens but
4:19 if it's not correct you can type it in
4:21 here and override the size now both of
4:24 these shapes have outlines I want the
4:26 circle to have a fill color that's dark
4:29 ER than the outline now we can barely
4:32 see the outline so let's change the
4:34 weight and we'll make it
4:36 3o and we better change the color so
4:40 that it's the same orange as the column
4:44 and I need to do the same for the column
4:47 so the fill color on the column will be
4:49 the same orange but the outline needs to
4:51 be the same weight and we want to make
4:54 sure it's that orange now the circle's
4:56 sitting behind the column so let's bring
4:58 it to the front
5:01 and with them both selected you can
5:03 group them and this is a good idea if
5:05 you have lots of shapes I only have two
5:06 in this case but with them grouped it
5:09 just makes it easier to work with so I
5:11 can now select it crl C to copy select
5:14 the column crl V to paste now you can
5:17 see it's distorted so there's a couple
5:19 of things we can do to remedy that we
5:21 can make the chart bigger taller or you
5:24 can change the value in here so if we
5:26 undo the change of the chart size make
5:28 this 20 contrl enter that's a bit better
5:32 so you can just play around with the
5:34 values here I'm going to change it back
5:36 to 15 and instead make my chart taller
5:40 okay let's select the legend we don't
5:41 need that just select it and delete
5:44 let's select The Circle Series and I'm
5:47 going to add data labels I'm going to go
5:50 into more options and then in here I can
5:54 do select show leader lines and value
5:56 and instead I want value from cells and
5:59 I want the total value rather than just
6:01 the circle
6:02 value now we can do some formatting to
6:05 those values let's change the font color
6:08 to white and we'll make them a bit
6:10 bigger now because we have two series
6:13 here I can use the data labels on this
6:15 series for my horizontal AIS labels so
6:18 let's add data labels here as
6:22 well and again we don't want lad lines
6:25 or values we want to use value from
6:27 cells and we want the label there
6:30 we want to put it inside the base we'll
6:33 format it white and make it bigger so
6:36 now that we have our values for the
6:39 horizontal axis and vertical axis on the
6:41 chart itself we don't need our axis
6:44 labels we also don't need the grid lines
6:48 and I'll get rid of the chart
6:50 title so there you have an infographic
6:53 style
6:54 chart again if you're going to put this
6:57 inside a bigger infographic you might
6:59 want to hide the shape outline so that
7:03 the chart looks even
7:06 cleaner now you can use more shapes and
7:09 more series as required for example you
7:11 might want a different bottom to the
7:13 columns like I have here and all I've
7:15 done is add another series to my chart
7:18 that's enabled me to add another shape
7:20 into the
7:22 chart I hope you found these techniques
