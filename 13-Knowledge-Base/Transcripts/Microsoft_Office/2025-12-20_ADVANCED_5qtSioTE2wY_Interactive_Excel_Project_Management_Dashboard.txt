0:01 hi I'm minda Tracy from my online training Hub I'll be taking you through how to use Excel to build this\n0:06 interactive project management dashboard that you see behind me at the top the dashboard header gives a high level\n0:13 overview of task progress and budget conditional formatting gives a visual indication of the progress of each task\n0:20 over time and it's colorcoded to reflect tasks not started in progress and\n0:26 completed the slices at the top allow us to filter tasks for specific projects\n0:33 and managers and as we make Selections in the slices you'll notice the headline charts also update now the scroll bar up\n0:41 here allows us to scroll horizontally through the dates we can move one day at a time or clicking in the middle of the\n0:49 scroll bar will jump a week at a time before we get started I just want\n0:55 to set your expectations for this tutorial first of all it's going to be at a Fast Pace you won't have time to\n1:01 follow along step by step the first time you watch it there's a link in the video description where you can download the\n1:07 workbook and data and of course you can rewatch the video as many times as you like pausing and rewinding as required\n1:16 now I'll be using Office 365 and one of the new Dynamic array functions but there are alternate formulas available\n1:23 for earlier versions of excel so what you see here can be done in all versions of excel from 2010 onwards\n1:30 okay let's get started building the dashboard from scratch here I have a new file sheet one\n1:36 is where I'll build the dashboard now I want to make it clear that this is just a regular Excel worksheet I've put some\n1:43 formatting and text in the header just to save me some time but otherwise it's\n1:48 just a regular sheet you don't need an addin or anything fancy to build this dashboard so now you know that I'm going\n1:55 to rename this sheet dashboard now my project data is on the\n2:01 data sheet and you'll notice that it's formatted in a tabular layout with one column for each field and a single Row\n2:09 for each task now I want to point out the formula in column F so let's just view the formula bar this calculates the\n2:16 end date and it uses the workday do International function and that allows\n2:22 me to ignore weekends if we look at the syntax we can see that it takes the start date which is the project start\n2:28 date then I've taken one day off because we want to include from the beginning of the start date in the project duration\n2:35 as opposed to from the end of the start date and then it adds a number of days which is the duration of the project and\n2:42 then the last argument we've got here is for the weekend now this is a number\n2:47 based on a list so let's just bring up this list so you can see number one specifies that my weekend days are\n2:54 Saturday and Sunday but you can choose from different combinations and even just have one day off\n3:00 obviously if your project runs 7 days a week then you don't need to use workday International you can just take the\n3:06 start date plus duration I need one for Saturday and Sunday now the last\n3:11 argument of workday International is to account for holidays so if you have holidays that you want to factor in that\n3:17 won't be worked on then you can refer to a list I'm going to leave it simple and just ignore weekends for this\n3:24 example so that's how my end date is calculated now the first thing we want to do is Ure The Source data is\n3:31 formatted in an Excel table because this will help me build the dashboard quickly but also means that updating can be done\n3:37 with the click of a single button and the keyboard shortcut to format data in a table isrl T brings up the create\n3:45 table dialog box and my table has headers is checked which applies here so\n3:50 I'm going to click okay you can see it's now formatted in a table that's got the color scheme and the header row has the\n3:57 filter buttons we also have this cont textual table design Tab and you can see my table name is called table one I'm\n4:04 going to leave it at that but it is a good idea to give your tables a proper name that's going to make it easy to\n4:10 reference when you build your dashboard so I'm now ready to insert my pivot table and we can do this directly\n4:17 from the table design tab summarize with pivot table so let's go ahead and do that this pivot table is going to be the\n4:23 main pivot table on my dashboard so I'm going to choose an existing worksheet which is my Dash for I'm going to pop it\n4:30 in there and click okay now the first thing I want to do is right click the\n4:36 pivot table and format the options to turn off autofit column widths on update\n4:42 I've already set my column widths so I don't want the pivot table messing with that as I build it now I'm just going to\n4:49 zoom out let's put it at 85% it's just going to give you a bit more view of the\n4:54 overall dashboard strictly speaking when building dashboards always build them at\n4:59 100% and make your charts and fonts smaller rather than zooming in and out it's just going to render those fonts\n5:06 and charts more clearly whereas when you use the zoom the images can become\n5:12 distorted okay so this pivot table has all of the fields so I want the project\n5:19 the task the manager I want the start date and then the end date now I'm just\n5:26 going to drag this field list out so we've got a bit more room I also want the days completed and the\n5:32 duration but because these are numeric Fields it will want to put them in the values area so I'm going to drag them\n5:39 down into the row labels just to make sure they go where I want and likewise the progress that's\n5:45 also a numeric field the budget and the actual can go into the values area now\n5:52 I'll just dock the field list again let's format this pivot table I want it to be in a tabular format so on the\n5:59 design design tab we're going to go report layout show in tabular form and\n6:04 we'll turn off all of the subtotals I also don't want any of these expand and collapse buttons so on the analyze tab\n6:10 I'm going to turn the buttons off now the pivot table is automatically grouped my dates so I'm going to right\n6:18 click and ungroup that's the start date and this is the end date and now we have the data\n6:25 without any grouping of my dates you can see the actual individual task s got a\n6:30 bit more formatting to do I don't want these labels to say sum of budget and sum of actual so I'm just going to type\n6:36 over them now I can't use budget because it's already in the field list so I'm going to trick it and just add a space\n6:42 to the end and we'll do the same for actual let's also write align those so\n6:49 that they're aligned the same as the numbers speaking of the numbers let's format them so I'm going to right click\n6:56 value field settings number format h here I want th separator and no decimal\n7:02 places now I recommend you always format your pivot table value Fields using the\n7:09 value field settings number format rather than the number formatting on the Home tab because that way the number\n7:17 formatting will remain with that field it won't matter what cells those fields are in it will always have the number\n7:23 formatting whereas if you use the number formatting up here and your pivot table changes shape or grows the number\n7:30 formatting may not remain with the field so always use the value field settings\n7:36 all right next I want this pivot table to look a bit more in keeping with my theme which is going to be Grays so\n7:42 let's set the style to this gray color we'll also remove the grid lines so that\n7:48 our dashboard looks a bit cleaner okay let's take a look at the dashboard see what's next we've got these charts up\n7:55 here so let's go ahead and we'll start creating the analysis for those charts so on my workings tab I've got some\n8:03 labels here ready to go what I want to do here is count the number of tasks\n8:08 that haven't started are in progress and are completed so we can use counter if\n8:14 for this not started now I could reference the data but because my\n8:20 dashboard will be at times filtered based on the slicer selections I want my\n8:25 count to reflect the data in the pivot table so I'm going to count the progress\n8:30 of the pivot table tasks and we'll just extend down to row 50 to allow for some\n8:35 growth obviously you can extend your countif further than that if you think you're going to have more growth so the\n8:42 criteria is where the progress equals zero the project hasn't started it's a\n8:50 close parenthesis so there are four projects that haven't started let's count those that are in progress now\n8:56 this time I need count FS because I need multiple criteria again we're\n9:01 referencing the progress field of the pivot table and we're going to extend it\n9:06 past the end to allow for growth so the first criteria is where the count is not\n9:13 equal to zero because obviously we want to\n9:18 count projects that are in progress and again we'll reference the\n9:24 progress is less than one if it's one then the project must be finished it's\n9:31 100% so this is our projects that are in progress where the count is not zero and\n9:38 less than one lastly we want to count how many projects are completed so this is again just a simple count if there's\n9:45 only one criteria and that is where the progress is 100% so we're at\n9:52 equals 1 so now we have our breakdown between\n9:57 not started in progress and complete we can see there are 37 projects remaining that is the not started plusy in\n10:03 progress and 40 tasks in total the completed plus the remaining now we want\n10:08 to insert a bar chart for these not started in progress and completed so on\n10:14 the insert tab I'm going to go into recommended charts and then all charts\n10:19 this way I can choose bar I want the Stacked bar this is the default but this\n10:25 is the one I actually want and this is the only place I can choose it so click okay and now we'll just do a little bit\n10:32 of formatting for this chart let's go ahead and we'll turn off the axes we're\n10:38 going to use labels instead we don't need grid lines and let's put the legend\n10:43 at the top next I want to control one to open the format\n10:48 Pane and actually I want to format the bar itself so we'll go into the series\n10:53 options here I want the Gap width to be zero but now now I want to change the\n11:00 size you'll see that it just enables the bar to fill up the space of the chart\n11:05 rather than having lots of white space so we want it 3.73 by 9 and we'll left aline the legend and\n11:13 the chart title let's give it a title now I'm going to paste this chart\n11:20 into my dashboard so I'm going to contrl X to cut it and then let's go back up\n11:26 and we'll paste it in control to paste now I need to format it because I don't\n11:31 want the fill in there so on the format pane we're going to change the shape fill to no fill and the shape outline to\n11:39 no outline let's make this font white so that it stands out on the gray\n11:44 background right let's take a look at what the next chart is we want this dut\n11:50 chart here that calculates the percentage of days completed versus the days remaining so we'll go ahead and\n11:57 create that on the workings tab I'm going to insert a new pivot table here\n12:03 we'll use the data again let's insert a pivot table we're going to pop it on the workings\n12:09 tab just here and I'll click okay so this one looks at the sum of the days\n12:16 completed versus the sum of the total duration and I want my values in the row\n12:22 labels now I need to reference this pivot table because I can't insert a\n12:28 donut ch start purely from this because it will sum these figures and that's not what I want so let's just create some\n12:34 labels days completed and days\n12:40 remaining and it's simply a case of referencing the pivot table you'll notice it puts in the get pivot data\n12:45 function so we want to find the percentage days completed are of the total duration and then we'll just\n12:52 calculate the balance which is 100% minus the days completed let's format\n12:57 them in percentage and we'll insert a donut chart now if you know me you know I'm not a big fan\n13:04 of donut charts but everyone seems to love them so I'm going to go with the flow in this particular example so let's\n13:11 go ahead and format it we don't want a chart title The Legend is actually going to be the title so put it at the top and\n13:18 let's resize it cuz it's enormous and it's not really conveying a lot of information so we're going to make it\n13:25 3.73 by 3.25 now we have to faf up out with the\n13:30 dut so I'm going to control one to open the formatting Pane and I want to make\n13:36 the whole size 60% and I need to add a label that shows\n13:41 the percentage of the days completed now I could use data labels but in my experience they don't stay put when you\n13:48 only want one and I want it to remain in the center of the dut hole so with the chart selected I'm going to insert a\n13:55 text box I'm just going to draw it over the top and then select the outside of the text\n14:01 box in the formula bar type equals click the cell containing the days completed\n14:07 percentage and press enter so now I can format it a little bit we'll change the\n14:12 font color to this more subtle gray and we can make the font a bit bigger let's\n14:18 just make that box bigger so that we can see the whole percentage so now I've completed that chart let's format it\n14:25 with no fill and no outline or crl X and we'll paste it in here now I need to\n14:32 format this with a white font and I need to move it up slightly so that it sits\n14:38 correctly over the gray area and then of course all the fiddling happens because\n14:44 the sizes don't Remain the way that you want we'll make the donut a little bigger as well okay so there's my first\n14:52 painful donut chart what's next let's take a look what I haven't done is\n14:57 format my My overall task progress bar to show the different fill colors and in\n15:03 fact my whole dashboard is not using this color scheme so let's spend a few minutes doing\n15:09 that up on the page layout tab in the colors I've got a custom color scheme\n15:14 for project management so I'll select that and it automatically updates everything so I haven't had to do a lot\n15:20 of work but I'm still going to have to customize these colors so control one to open the format data series on the paint\n15:28 bucket I want this not started category to have no fill and I want the border to\n15:35 be a solid pink outline now it's quite a thin line so I'm going to increase it to\n15:42 1.5 this one here is correct already but now that I've put a border around the KN\n15:49 started it doesn't look so good so let's add a border to this as well in the same\n15:54 color but we'll give it 1.5 as well and and we'll do the same for this one this\n16:00 one's going to have a solid fill in this green color but it also needs a\n16:07 border and needs to be 1.5 that way they're all the same size along the\n16:12 length of the bar I'm going to go ahead and give this font a white color just so\n16:19 it stands out a bit better on the pink we can do the same for this green and we'll leave the four as is\n16:26 otherwise you won't be able to read it now I'm just going to bring this down a little bit okay those two charts are\n16:32 looking pretty good let's take a look at what's next so we need to create some\n16:37 pivot tables to calculate the percentage of budget that's spent and to show us the total budget versus the actual so\n16:45 let's go ahead and do that again from the data tab I'm going to insert a pivot\n16:50 table on the working sheet now if you know me you'll know I\n16:56 recommend that you always put pivot tables on their own sheet just so they don't overlap each other accidentally\n17:02 when you're building and updating your dashboards I'm cheating a little here so bear with me but you really should abide\n17:09 by that rule and only put one pivot table per sheet all right here I need to\n17:15 know what the actual is and the budget now I want to format these fields to\n17:22 Millions so we're going to right click value field settings number format and here I want a custom number format so I\n17:30 want 0.0 and then to round to Millions you put in two commas and I obviously need\n17:36 to classify it as Millions so let's type in M for Millions after the backs slash\n17:42 that's the positive value semicolon the negative value will be the same except\n17:47 it has a minus sign and we'll leave it at that and click okay and okay again now I need to\n17:54 do the same for the budget let's go in but now that I've created to the custom number format we'll find it at the very\n18:00 end and I can just simply select it from the list and click okay so now we have\n18:07 the actual and the budget I need to change these labels and add a space to the\n18:13 end now this is going to be for my bar chart so I might just add a column in\n18:18 here and let's give it a label bar chart and I need to also create a donut\n18:25 chart for the percentage so it's going to calculate the percentage of actual\n18:31 over the budget and then the balance is 1 minus the actual percentage so we\n18:37 format these as a percentage sign all right I'll insert the donut chart\n18:43 first now this one has got a title but no Legend and we'll change the size so that\n18:51 it fits on our dashboard it's 3.73 by\n18:57 3.25 again we need to change the donut whole size to\n19:02 60% and we'll give the chart a title budget spent and obviously the\n19:08 font's a bit big so let's make it a bit smaller and we'll make it white while we're here next with the chart selected\n19:16 I'm going to insert a text box to house a percentage so draw that on select the\n19:24 outside of the text box in the formula bar equals and then the\n19:30 percentage let's format this a little bit make it a bit bigger and we'll give\n19:35 it a lighter gray all right now I'm going to cut this out and\n19:42 then we'll make the donut bigger size so contrl X to cut crl V to paste it\n19:49 in I forgot to take out the fill and the shape outline all right so we'll move\n19:56 this label up a little bit and now we can make the dut a bit bigger so I'm just left clicking and\n20:03 dragging the pull handles okay that's maybe a bit big let's do a little smaller all right we\n20:09 wanted to sort of stay in keeping with the size of this one so they're roughly the same size I won't waste too much\n20:15 time CU you get the idea and you can make those changes yourself the next chart I need is the bar chart that looks\n20:22 at the budget and actual so back on the workings this one is a pivot chart so\n20:28 with the pivot table selected I can go onto the pivot table Tab and insert pivot chart I want a bar chart and I'll\n20:35 click okay all right first thing I want to do is right click and hide all the field\n20:41 buttons then we're going to get rid of the axes we'll give the chart a title I want data labels no grid lines\n20:49 and no Legend because I'm going to select my data labels and then we'll go\n20:55 in and we'll format them so that they show the series name and let me just get\n21:01 rid of that so you can see so I've added the series name I'll get rid of leader lines just in case and I want the series\n21:08 name and the value on their own line so I'm going to select new line we need to rinse and repeat for the\n21:16 actual okay now I need to separate These Bars a little so my series overlap is\n21:23 going to be minus 30 and my Gap width is going to be zero\n21:30 makes it look enormous so let's resize the chart remember it's 3.73 high and\n21:35 this one is Six Wide we'll fix the chart title I'll bring it over to the\n21:41 left so we'll get rid of the fill and the outline and crl x and I'll paste it\n21:47 into the dashboard we need to change that font color to white I can bring it over a bit so there\n21:55 our headline charts completed what we want to do now is insert some\n22:01 interactivity in the form of slices so with my pivot table selected on the\n22:06 pivot table analyze tab I can insert slicer or you can do it via the insert tab I want slices for the projects and\n22:13 the managers so there's my two slices let's bring them up here we'll\n22:19 give them five columns and let me resize\n22:25 them and I'll bring this one up B side let's just align them to the\n22:32 top okay so they're my slices but right now they're only connected to this pivot table I need to also connect them to\n22:38 this one and this one so all I need to do is right click the slicer go into report connections and select the other\n22:46 pivot tables from the list we'll do the same for this one now when I select a project you can\n22:54 see that it feeds through to the other chart S as well likewise if I select\n23:00 managers you can see they're all updating now something I want to do is format the number style for this bar\n23:07 chart so control one what I want to do is if the number is zero I don't want to\n23:13 show it so I'm going to create a custom number format in fact I've already got one there that I've used before so I\n23:19 want one digit for the positive minus the digit for the negative and the zero\n23:25 format is left blank which means it will be hidden so I'll apply that and I need\n23:31 to do it one at a time and we'll choose the same one for\n23:37 each of the labels okay so now if I choose a manager\n23:45 that doesn't have for example in this case lad hasn't got any completed projects you're not seeing a zero for\n23:51 the label on the completed segment of the bar all right now I can actually\n23:57 move these over a little bit we can see them all in one screen\n24:03 only just okay the next thing I want to do is give my user a little bit of\n24:08 information about the date range that my dashboard is currently looking at so I'm\n24:14 going to clear all the slices so that my dashboard is showing all of the data and then we're going to insert a text\n24:20 function here that finds the minimum date from the start date and I'm going\n24:25 to extend it down to allow for growth now the text function wants to know how\n24:31 that date should be formatted so I'll just type in my date format it doesn't have to be in capitals just I've got\n24:36 caps lock on so we'll do day month year and then I want to join the start date\n24:43 to some text that says two with a space either side and then we're going to find\n24:51 the end date so we're going to convert it to text and find the maximum of the end date again allowing\n24:58 for growth formatted the same so day month year if you're in the US then\n25:06 obviously you'll change that formatting to month day year and when I press enter\n25:12 we get the date range and if I select a different project you can see that the\n25:17 formula up here adjusts accordingly let's just take a look at\n25:23 what's next in the dashboard you you can see here we're missing all of the information about the\n25:31 task progress and we need to add in these conditional formatting bars so up\n25:36 to the conditional formatting stage but remember when I click on the scroll bar\n25:41 the dates here adjust so I need to insert the scroll bar so let's go ahead and do\n25:47 that now on the developer tab you'll find insert and then form controls and\n25:53 this is the scroll bar if you don't have the developer tab right click any of of the tabs go customize ribbon and you can\n26:00 check the box for developer then you'll have the developer tab and be able to insert a scroll bar you can see my mouse\n26:07 has changed to the cross and I can just left click and drag to draw it in now I\n26:12 need to assign this scroll bar to an output cell so I'm going to right click\n26:18 format the control here I can specify the current value I'm going to put in one just so you can see what happens\n26:25 when you link it to a cell the minimum value will be zero that's fine the maximum value I'm going to go with 30\n26:31 that's 30 days incremental change one day at a time when you click the ends of\n26:37 the scroll bar and Page change will be seven one week when you click inside the\n26:43 scroll bar and I'm going to link it to a cell on my working sheet so click okay\n26:49 now if we take a look at that cell you can see the cell link is returning one so let's give this a label so we know\n26:55 what this field represents if I go back to the dashboard and\n27:01 deselect the scroll bar now when I click on it it moves accordingly and if we\n27:07 look at the workings now it's at position zero the next thing I need to do is insert a list of dates in this row\n27:15 now I'm going to use the sequence function for this this is a new function available in Office 365 if you don't\n27:22 have Office 365 then there are alternatives and I Do cover those in my\n27:27 Excel dashboard course so I want to automatically create a sequence of dates\n27:32 I only want them in one row so the first argument is one how many columns of dates well I'm going to grow out 26\n27:39 columns that's nearly four weeks that will do the start well what's the\n27:45 earliest date I need to use the Min function to find the earliest date in my\n27:52 list here and allowing for growth but remember we've got this scroll bar in here so we want want to take account of\n27:58 the scroll position so I'm going to add the scroll bar position and then the next argument is\n28:07 simply the step so here I want the step just to be one day at a time so close\n28:14 parentheses and you can see it's added in the dates they're not all formatted correctly so let me go ahead and do that\n28:21 we use a custom number format day day month month month and click okay okay all right\n28:28 let's also format them so they're all centered in that row so they're my dates\n28:33 now if you keep an eye on them as I click in the scroll bar the dates are updating that's because it's adding the\n28:40 value from the scroll bar all right we're ready to do the conditional formatting so first let me add some data\n28:48 bars to the progress that will just give us a nice visual indicator of the progress rather than having to read the\n28:54 percentages so conditional formatting data bars and we'll just do this one with solid fill now I don't particularly\n29:01 like the color so I'm going to go in and manage the rule double click to open the\n29:07 editing dialogue where I can select this color which is in keeping with my theme\n29:13 and we'll click okay so that's quick and easy and as this changes these data buzs\n29:19 will automatically adjust now I need to continue this formatting across my column in fact I\n29:26 haven't sent those so let's do that as well and we'll use conditional formatting to do that that way if this\n29:33 grows then the conditional formatting will adjust as well rather than hard\n29:38 keying the formatting if you like so we'll go conditional formatting new rule here I need to use a formula to\n29:46 determine which cells to format and the formula is really simple I just want to\n29:52 check whether this cell here and I need to change the absolute reference so that it's only f fixed on the row and not the\n29:58 column is not equal to blank so I'll give it this gray\n30:05 fill and I just want to distinguish each day's column area so we're just going to\n30:11 use white and we'll give it a border a vertical border and that will just give it a more defined look the other thing\n30:18 we need to do is put in a freeze pane so on The View tab just going to freeze row\n30:24 five and that way when we scroll down all the data and our header remains in\n30:29 place we're ready to apply the conditional formatting for our tasks so\n30:35 the first thing I want to do is select all the cells that I want the formatting applied to and we'll go out to column\n30:43 AJ I've allowed for growth going down to row 50 but obviously you can allow for\n30:48 more growth if you need so here again hom tab conditional formatting new rule\n30:56 it's a formula based rule so here I want to let me move this across here\n31:01 highlight which days in this calendar are weekend dates so we're going to use\n31:07 the weekday function for this but I need multiple criteria so I need the and function and then weekday so weekday\n31:15 Returns the day number based on a calendar that you specify similar to the workday International function so I need\n31:23 to select the first date and then just absolute the row and the calendar that I\n31:29 want to use is the second calendar that specifies my weekends are Saturday and Sunday so all I need to do is test that\n31:38 the weekday number is greater than five when you specify two as the weekday type\n31:45 it numbers Monday is 1 through to Sunday is 7 so Saturday is 6 and Sunday is 7\n31:51 therefore any days greater than five are the weekend dates the other criteria I want to check\n31:57 check is that I actually have a task on this row because as we scroll down rows\n32:03 47 through 50 have no tasks but I don't want the weekend format to flow through to those days unless there's actually a\n32:11 task so I'm going to Absolute just the column and check that it's not blank so\n32:16 we'll close the and and let's go ahead and format them with a pattern that just\n32:23 hashes out those dates I'll click okay and you can see my weekend days are now\n32:29 formatted the next formatting is for the completed days so again conditional\n32:34 formatting new rule based on a formula again equals and so here I want to test\n32:42 which days have tasks that are in progress and color them with a green fill so we need to check whether the\n32:49 date and I just want to Absolute the row is greater than or equal\n32:54 to the start date and I want to Absolute just the column and I need to check that\n33:02 this state is greater than or equal to the current days completed so we're\n33:07 going to use workday International like I did to calculate the end dat of the project taking the start date absolute\n33:16 the column plus the days completed absolute the column using the date type\n33:25 one which specif Saturday and Sundays as my weekends minus one because we need to\n33:32 include the start date in our range and if I don't minus one from this calculation it will calculate from the\n33:40 start date not inclusive of it so we'll check that it's greater than or equal to\n33:45 the current date absolute just the row close parentheses on my\n33:50 and now I can go ahead and apply the format so I want this green fill color\n33:56 and I'm going to to apply a white border top and bottom just to give a bit more definition to the fill and I'll click\n34:04 okay so now we have our completed days notice that it's sitting behind the\n34:10 weekend dates that's okay we're going to fix that in a little while the next conditional format we need to apply is\n34:18 for the in progress so let me just select all the cells again I'll scroll back up to the\n34:25 top all right conditional formatting new rule based on a formula again you'll notice that they\n34:32 also use a similar formula so we need multiple criteria again I need and and\n34:38 I'm checking whether the date in the first cell absolute just the row is\n34:44 greater than or equal to work day international taking the start date\n34:51 absolute the column plus the days completed absolute the column based on\n34:58 type one and that the progress absolute the column is not equal to one because\n35:06 it's not complete it's in progress and the date absolute the row is less\n35:14 than or equal to the end date absolute the column now I'm just using F4 to\n35:21 Absolute those fields close my parentheses and let's go ahead and\n35:26 format it again we'll use a white top and bottom border and the fill color\n35:31 this time is pink so click okay and okay again so we've got our completed in\n35:37 green our in progress in pink and we need these not started Fields conditionally formatted next so new rule\n35:44 using formula equals and so we need to check that the date absolute the row is\n35:51 greater than or equal to workday International taking the start date\n35:58 absolute the column plus the days completed absolute the column based on\n36:04 type one and progress absolute the column is equal to zero we're looking\n36:12 for projects that aren't started and the current date absolute the row is less\n36:18 than or equal to the end date absolute column close parentheses and then we\n36:25 just format it no fill but we want the pink\n36:31 border click okay and okay again now we can't see it and that's because the\n36:36 order of our conditional formatting isn't correct so I'm going to go into the conditional formatting and manage\n36:41 the rules so here I need to bring the weekend rule to the top and click stop\n36:48 of true and when we do this you'll notice that these green bars go away so click\n36:53 apply now I need to also set this one on as stop as true and that way it will be\n36:58 applied before this fill color and now you can see the formatting for the knot\n37:04 started is applied and then this one is never evaluated because it stops if it's true I'll click okay and that's our\n37:12 conditional formatting almost done one thing I'd like to do is continue on this\n37:17 gray fill across the grand total row but because that grand total row can change\n37:22 depending on which project you have selected I need to use condition formatting for that as well so again I'm\n37:30 going to go down and select the fields that I want formatted and then conditional\n37:37 formatting new rule based on a formula here I want to check whether\n37:44 this row this cell here absolute the column only contains the text grand\n37:51 total and here I want to apply the formatting this is going to have this gray fill and we'll give it a top border\n37:59 I think it's this darker gray here so click okay and okay again and you can\n38:04 see now it's formatted with the gray fill and if I change my filter you can\n38:10 see that that formatting moves with the bottom of the pivot table one thing I forgot to do was just\n38:18 abbreviate this label so that it fits in more easily of course with dashboards like\n38:24 this the data is being updated all the time and by formatting The Source data in an Excel table you're making that job super\n38:31 easy for example let's say I have some new tasks to add to project vager we can see at the moment there's only five\n38:38 tasks all I need to do is add that data to the bottom of my table or I can\n38:44 insert new rows I've got some data copied to my clipboard so I'm just going to contrl + V to paste it in can see the\n38:50 formula has copied down likewise for the progress now if I go back to the\n38:56 dashboard all I need to do is go to the data Tab and click on the refresh all\n39:01 button and you'll see not only will the pivot table update but so with all of these charts click refresh all and now\n39:09 my two new tasks have been added and this also applies to any changes you\n39:14 make to existing task progress so you can see updating your dashboards when you build them with Excel tables and\n39:20 pivot tables is super fast now I know I ran through that quite\n39:26 quickly but remember you can download the file at the link in the video description you'll find it contains\n39:33 step-by-step instructions with screenshots as well as more resources including links to tutorials on the\n39:39 functions and conditional formatting used to build this dashboard and as a bonus you'll find some tips on dashboard\n39:46 protection now if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and subscribe to my channel and click the Bell icon to\n39:53 be notified when I post my next video and please share it with your friends and co-workers thanks for\n40:02 watching\n0:01 hi I'm minda Tracy from my online training Hub I'll be taking you through how to use Excel to build this\n0:06 interactive project management dashboard that you see behind me at the top the dashboard header gives a high level\n0:13 overview of task progress and budget conditional formatting gives a visual indication of the progress of each task\n0:20 over time and it's colorcoded to reflect tasks not started in progress and\n0:26 completed the slices at the top allow us to filter tasks for specific projects\n0:33 and managers and as we make Selections in the slices you'll notice the headline charts also update now the scroll bar up\n0:41 here allows us to scroll horizontally through the dates we can move one day at a time or clicking in the middle of the\n0:49 scroll bar will jump a week at a time before we get started I just want\n0:55 to set your expectations for this tutorial first of all it's going to be at a Fast Pace you won't have time to\n1:01 follow along step by step the first time you watch it there's a link in the video description where you can download the\n1:07 workbook and data and of course you can rewatch the video as many times as you like pausing and rewinding as required\n1:16 now I'll be using Office 365 and one of the new Dynamic array functions but there are alternate formulas available\n1:23 for earlier versions of excel so what you see here can be done in all versions of excel from 2010 onwards\n1:30 okay let's get started building the dashboard from scratch here I have a new file sheet one\n1:36 is where I'll build the dashboard now I want to make it clear that this is just a regular Excel worksheet I've put some\n1:43 formatting and text in the header just to save me some time but otherwise it's\n1:48 just a regular sheet you don't need an addin or anything fancy to build this dashboard so now you know that I'm going\n1:55 to rename this sheet dashboard now my project data is on the\n2:01 data sheet and you'll notice that it's formatted in a tabular layout with one column for each field and a single Row\n2:09 for each task now I want to point out the formula in column F so let's just view the formula bar this calculates the\n2:16 end date and it uses the workday do International function and that allows\n2:22 me to ignore weekends if we look at the syntax we can see that it takes the start date which is the project start\n2:28 date then I've taken one day off because we want to include from the beginning of the start date in the project duration\n2:35 as opposed to from the end of the start date and then it adds a number of days which is the duration of the project and\n2:42 then the last argument we've got here is for the weekend now this is a number\n2:47 based on a list so let's just bring up this list so you can see number one specifies that my weekend days are\n2:54 Saturday and Sunday but you can choose from different combinations and even just have one day off\n3:00 obviously if your project runs 7 days a week then you don't need to use workday International you can just take the\n3:06 start date plus duration I need one for Saturday and Sunday now the last\n3:11 argument of workday International is to account for holidays so if you have holidays that you want to factor in that\n3:17 won't be worked on then you can refer to a list I'm going to leave it simple and just ignore weekends for this\n3:24 example so that's how my end date is calculated now the first thing we want to do is Ure The Source data is\n3:31 formatted in an Excel table because this will help me build the dashboard quickly but also means that updating can be done\n3:37 with the click of a single button and the keyboard shortcut to format data in a table isrl T brings up the create\n3:45 table dialog box and my table has headers is checked which applies here so\n3:50 I'm going to click okay you can see it's now formatted in a table that's got the color scheme and the header row has the\n3:57 filter buttons we also have this cont textual table design Tab and you can see my table name is called table one I'm\n4:04 going to leave it at that but it is a good idea to give your tables a proper name that's going to make it easy to\n4:10 reference when you build your dashboard so I'm now ready to insert my pivot table and we can do this directly\n4:17 from the table design tab summarize with pivot table so let's go ahead and do that this pivot table is going to be the\n4:23 main pivot table on my dashboard so I'm going to choose an existing worksheet which is my Dash for I'm going to pop it\n4:30 in there and click okay now the first thing I want to do is right click the\n4:36 pivot table and format the options to turn off autofit column widths on update\n4:42 I've already set my column widths so I don't want the pivot table messing with that as I build it now I'm just going to\n4:49 zoom out let's put it at 85% it's just going to give you a bit more view of the\n4:54 overall dashboard strictly speaking when building dashboards always build them at\n4:59 100% and make your charts and fonts smaller rather than zooming in and out it's just going to render those fonts\n5:06 and charts more clearly whereas when you use the zoom the images can become\n5:12 distorted okay so this pivot table has all of the fields so I want the project\n5:19 the task the manager I want the start date and then the end date now I'm just\n5:26 going to drag this field list out so we've got a bit more room I also want the days completed and the\n5:32 duration but because these are numeric Fields it will want to put them in the values area so I'm going to drag them\n5:39 down into the row labels just to make sure they go where I want and likewise the progress that's\n5:45 also a numeric field the budget and the actual can go into the values area now\n5:52 I'll just dock the field list again let's format this pivot table I want it to be in a tabular format so on the\n5:59 design design tab we're going to go report layout show in tabular form and\n6:04 we'll turn off all of the subtotals I also don't want any of these expand and collapse buttons so on the analyze tab\n6:10 I'm going to turn the buttons off now the pivot table is automatically grouped my dates so I'm going to right\n6:18 click and ungroup that's the start date and this is the end date and now we have the data\n6:25 without any grouping of my dates you can see the actual individual task s got a\n6:30 bit more formatting to do I don't want these labels to say sum of budget and sum of actual so I'm just going to type\n6:36 over them now I can't use budget because it's already in the field list so I'm going to trick it and just add a space\n6:42 to the end and we'll do the same for actual let's also write align those so\n6:49 that they're aligned the same as the numbers speaking of the numbers let's format them so I'm going to right click\n6:56 value field settings number format h here I want th separator and no decimal\n7:02 places now I recommend you always format your pivot table value Fields using the\n7:09 value field settings number format rather than the number formatting on the Home tab because that way the number\n7:17 formatting will remain with that field it won't matter what cells those fields are in it will always have the number\n7:23 formatting whereas if you use the number formatting up here and your pivot table changes shape or grows the number\n7:30 formatting may not remain with the field so always use the value field settings\n7:36 all right next I want this pivot table to look a bit more in keeping with my theme which is going to be Grays so\n7:42 let's set the style to this gray color we'll also remove the grid lines so that\n7:48 our dashboard looks a bit cleaner okay let's take a look at the dashboard see what's next we've got these charts up\n7:55 here so let's go ahead and we'll start creating the analysis for those charts so on my workings tab I've got some\n8:03 labels here ready to go what I want to do here is count the number of tasks\n8:08 that haven't started are in progress and are completed so we can use counter if\n8:14 for this not started now I could reference the data but because my\n8:20 dashboard will be at times filtered based on the slicer selections I want my\n8:25 count to reflect the data in the pivot table so I'm going to count the progress\n8:30 of the pivot table tasks and we'll just extend down to row 50 to allow for some\n8:35 growth obviously you can extend your countif further than that if you think you're going to have more growth so the\n8:42 criteria is where the progress equals zero the project hasn't started it's a\n8:50 close parenthesis so there are four projects that haven't started let's count those that are in progress now\n8:56 this time I need count FS because I need multiple criteria again we're\n9:01 referencing the progress field of the pivot table and we're going to extend it\n9:06 past the end to allow for growth so the first criteria is where the count is not\n9:13 equal to zero because obviously we want to\n9:18 count projects that are in progress and again we'll reference the\n9:24 progress is less than one if it's one then the project must be finished it's\n9:31 100% so this is our projects that are in progress where the count is not zero and\n9:38 less than one lastly we want to count how many projects are completed so this is again just a simple count if there's\n9:45 only one criteria and that is where the progress is 100% so we're at\n9:52 equals 1 so now we have our breakdown between\n9:57 not started in progress and complete we can see there are 37 projects remaining that is the not started plusy in\n10:03 progress and 40 tasks in total the completed plus the remaining now we want\n10:08 to insert a bar chart for these not started in progress and completed so on\n10:14 the insert tab I'm going to go into recommended charts and then all charts\n10:19 this way I can choose bar I want the Stacked bar this is the default but this\n10:25 is the one I actually want and this is the only place I can choose it so click okay and now we'll just do a little bit\n10:32 of formatting for this chart let's go ahead and we'll turn off the axes we're\n10:38 going to use labels instead we don't need grid lines and let's put the legend\n10:43 at the top next I want to control one to open the format\n10:48 Pane and actually I want to format the bar itself so we'll go into the series\n10:53 options here I want the Gap width to be zero but now now I want to change the\n11:00 size you'll see that it just enables the bar to fill up the space of the chart\n11:05 rather than having lots of white space so we want it 3.73 by 9 and we'll left aline the legend and\n11:13 the chart title let's give it a title now I'm going to paste this chart\n11:20 into my dashboard so I'm going to contrl X to cut it and then let's go back up\n11:26 and we'll paste it in control to paste now I need to format it because I don't\n11:31 want the fill in there so on the format pane we're going to change the shape fill to no fill and the shape outline to\n11:39 no outline let's make this font white so that it stands out on the gray\n11:44 background right let's take a look at what the next chart is we want this dut\n11:50 chart here that calculates the percentage of days completed versus the days remaining so we'll go ahead and\n11:57 create that on the workings tab I'm going to insert a new pivot table here\n12:03 we'll use the data again let's insert a pivot table we're going to pop it on the workings\n12:09 tab just here and I'll click okay so this one looks at the sum of the days\n12:16 completed versus the sum of the total duration and I want my values in the row\n12:22 labels now I need to reference this pivot table because I can't insert a\n12:28 donut ch start purely from this because it will sum these figures and that's not what I want so let's just create some\n12:34 labels days completed and days\n12:40 remaining and it's simply a case of referencing the pivot table you'll notice it puts in the get pivot data\n12:45 function so we want to find the percentage days completed are of the total duration and then we'll just\n12:52 calculate the balance which is 100% minus the days completed let's format\n12:57 them in percentage and we'll insert a donut chart now if you know me you know I'm not a big fan\n13:04 of donut charts but everyone seems to love them so I'm going to go with the flow in this particular example so let's\n13:11 go ahead and format it we don't want a chart title The Legend is actually going to be the title so put it at the top and\n13:18 let's resize it cuz it's enormous and it's not really conveying a lot of information so we're going to make it\n13:25 3.73 by 3.25 now we have to faf up out with the\n13:30 dut so I'm going to control one to open the formatting Pane and I want to make\n13:36 the whole size 60% and I need to add a label that shows\n13:41 the percentage of the days completed now I could use data labels but in my experience they don't stay put when you\n13:48 only want one and I want it to remain in the center of the dut hole so with the chart selected I'm going to insert a\n13:55 text box I'm just going to draw it over the top and then select the outside of the text\n14:01 box in the formula bar type equals click the cell containing the days completed\n14:07 percentage and press enter so now I can format it a little bit we'll change the\n14:12 font color to this more subtle gray and we can make the font a bit bigger let's\n14:18 just make that box bigger so that we can see the whole percentage so now I've completed that chart let's format it\n14:25 with no fill and no outline or crl X and we'll paste it in here now I need to\n14:32 format this with a white font and I need to move it up slightly so that it sits\n14:38 correctly over the gray area and then of course all the fiddling happens because\n14:44 the sizes don't Remain the way that you want we'll make the donut a little bigger as well okay so there's my first\n14:52 painful donut chart what's next let's take a look what I haven't done is\n14:57 format my My overall task progress bar to show the different fill colors and in\n15:03 fact my whole dashboard is not using this color scheme so let's spend a few minutes doing\n15:09 that up on the page layout tab in the colors I've got a custom color scheme\n15:14 for project management so I'll select that and it automatically updates everything so I haven't had to do a lot\n15:20 of work but I'm still going to have to customize these colors so control one to open the format data series on the paint\n15:28 bucket I want this not started category to have no fill and I want the border to\n15:35 be a solid pink outline now it's quite a thin line so I'm going to increase it to\n15:42 1.5 this one here is correct already but now that I've put a border around the KN\n15:49 started it doesn't look so good so let's add a border to this as well in the same\n15:54 color but we'll give it 1.5 as well and and we'll do the same for this one this\n16:00 one's going to have a solid fill in this green color but it also needs a\n16:07 border and needs to be 1.5 that way they're all the same size along the\n16:12 length of the bar I'm going to go ahead and give this font a white color just so\n16:19 it stands out a bit better on the pink we can do the same for this green and we'll leave the four as is\n16:26 otherwise you won't be able to read it now I'm just going to bring this down a little bit okay those two charts are\n16:32 looking pretty good let's take a look at what's next so we need to create some\n16:37 pivot tables to calculate the percentage of budget that's spent and to show us the total budget versus the actual so\n16:45 let's go ahead and do that again from the data tab I'm going to insert a pivot\n16:50 table on the working sheet now if you know me you'll know I\n16:56 recommend that you always put pivot tables on their own sheet just so they don't overlap each other accidentally\n17:02 when you're building and updating your dashboards I'm cheating a little here so bear with me but you really should abide\n17:09 by that rule and only put one pivot table per sheet all right here I need to\n17:15 know what the actual is and the budget now I want to format these fields to\n17:22 Millions so we're going to right click value field settings number format and here I want a custom number format so I\n17:30 want 0.0 and then to round to Millions you put in two commas and I obviously need\n17:36 to classify it as Millions so let's type in M for Millions after the backs slash\n17:42 that's the positive value semicolon the negative value will be the same except\n17:47 it has a minus sign and we'll leave it at that and click okay and okay again now I need to\n17:54 do the same for the budget let's go in but now that I've created to the custom number format we'll find it at the very\n18:00 end and I can just simply select it from the list and click okay so now we have\n18:07 the actual and the budget I need to change these labels and add a space to the\n18:13 end now this is going to be for my bar chart so I might just add a column in\n18:18 here and let's give it a label bar chart and I need to also create a donut\n18:25 chart for the percentage so it's going to calculate the percentage of actual\n18:31 over the budget and then the balance is 1 minus the actual percentage so we\n18:37 format these as a percentage sign all right I'll insert the donut chart\n18:43 first now this one has got a title but no Legend and we'll change the size so that\n18:51 it fits on our dashboard it's 3.73 by\n18:57 3.25 again we need to change the donut whole size to\n19:02 60% and we'll give the chart a title budget spent and obviously the\n19:08 font's a bit big so let's make it a bit smaller and we'll make it white while we're here next with the chart selected\n19:16 I'm going to insert a text box to house a percentage so draw that on select the\n19:24 outside of the text box in the formula bar equals and then the\n19:30 percentage let's format this a little bit make it a bit bigger and we'll give\n19:35 it a lighter gray all right now I'm going to cut this out and\n19:42 then we'll make the donut bigger size so contrl X to cut crl V to paste it\n19:49 in I forgot to take out the fill and the shape outline all right so we'll move\n19:56 this label up a little bit and now we can make the dut a bit bigger so I'm just left clicking and\n20:03 dragging the pull handles okay that's maybe a bit big let's do a little smaller all right we\n20:09 wanted to sort of stay in keeping with the size of this one so they're roughly the same size I won't waste too much\n20:15 time CU you get the idea and you can make those changes yourself the next chart I need is the bar chart that looks\n20:22 at the budget and actual so back on the workings this one is a pivot chart so\n20:28 with the pivot table selected I can go onto the pivot table Tab and insert pivot chart I want a bar chart and I'll\n20:35 click okay all right first thing I want to do is right click and hide all the field\n20:41 buttons then we're going to get rid of the axes we'll give the chart a title I want data labels no grid lines\n20:49 and no Legend because I'm going to select my data labels and then we'll go\n20:55 in and we'll format them so that they show the series name and let me just get\n21:01 rid of that so you can see so I've added the series name I'll get rid of leader lines just in case and I want the series\n21:08 name and the value on their own line so I'm going to select new line we need to rinse and repeat for the\n21:16 actual okay now I need to separate These Bars a little so my series overlap is\n21:23 going to be minus 30 and my Gap width is going to be zero\n21:30 makes it look enormous so let's resize the chart remember it's 3.73 high and\n21:35 this one is Six Wide we'll fix the chart title I'll bring it over to the\n21:41 left so we'll get rid of the fill and the outline and crl x and I'll paste it\n21:47 into the dashboard we need to change that font color to white I can bring it over a bit so there\n21:55 our headline charts completed what we want to do now is insert some\n22:01 interactivity in the form of slices so with my pivot table selected on the\n22:06 pivot table analyze tab I can insert slicer or you can do it via the insert tab I want slices for the projects and\n22:13 the managers so there's my two slices let's bring them up here we'll\n22:19 give them five columns and let me resize\n22:25 them and I'll bring this one up B side let's just align them to the\n22:32 top okay so they're my slices but right now they're only connected to this pivot table I need to also connect them to\n22:38 this one and this one so all I need to do is right click the slicer go into report connections and select the other\n22:46 pivot tables from the list we'll do the same for this one now when I select a project you can\n22:54 see that it feeds through to the other chart S as well likewise if I select\n23:00 managers you can see they're all updating now something I want to do is format the number style for this bar\n23:07 chart so control one what I want to do is if the number is zero I don't want to\n23:13 show it so I'm going to create a custom number format in fact I've already got one there that I've used before so I\n23:19 want one digit for the positive minus the digit for the negative and the zero\n23:25 format is left blank which means it will be hidden so I'll apply that and I need\n23:31 to do it one at a time and we'll choose the same one for\n23:37 each of the labels okay so now if I choose a manager\n23:45 that doesn't have for example in this case lad hasn't got any completed projects you're not seeing a zero for\n23:51 the label on the completed segment of the bar all right now I can actually\n23:57 move these over a little bit we can see them all in one screen\n24:03 only just okay the next thing I want to do is give my user a little bit of\n24:08 information about the date range that my dashboard is currently looking at so I'm\n24:14 going to clear all the slices so that my dashboard is showing all of the data and then we're going to insert a text\n24:20 function here that finds the minimum date from the start date and I'm going\n24:25 to extend it down to allow for growth now the text function wants to know how\n24:31 that date should be formatted so I'll just type in my date format it doesn't have to be in capitals just I've got\n24:36 caps lock on so we'll do day month year and then I want to join the start date\n24:43 to some text that says two with a space either side and then we're going to find\n24:51 the end date so we're going to convert it to text and find the maximum of the end date again allowing\n24:58 for growth formatted the same so day month year if you're in the US then\n25:06 obviously you'll change that formatting to month day year and when I press enter\n25:12 we get the date range and if I select a different project you can see that the\n25:17 formula up here adjusts accordingly let's just take a look at\n25:23 what's next in the dashboard you you can see here we're missing all of the information about the\n25:31 task progress and we need to add in these conditional formatting bars so up\n25:36 to the conditional formatting stage but remember when I click on the scroll bar\n25:41 the dates here adjust so I need to insert the scroll bar so let's go ahead and do\n25:47 that now on the developer tab you'll find insert and then form controls and\n25:53 this is the scroll bar if you don't have the developer tab right click any of of the tabs go customize ribbon and you can\n26:00 check the box for developer then you'll have the developer tab and be able to insert a scroll bar you can see my mouse\n26:07 has changed to the cross and I can just left click and drag to draw it in now I\n26:12 need to assign this scroll bar to an output cell so I'm going to right click\n26:18 format the control here I can specify the current value I'm going to put in one just so you can see what happens\n26:25 when you link it to a cell the minimum value will be zero that's fine the maximum value I'm going to go with 30\n26:31 that's 30 days incremental change one day at a time when you click the ends of\n26:37 the scroll bar and Page change will be seven one week when you click inside the\n26:43 scroll bar and I'm going to link it to a cell on my working sheet so click okay\n26:49 now if we take a look at that cell you can see the cell link is returning one so let's give this a label so we know\n26:55 what this field represents if I go back to the dashboard and\n27:01 deselect the scroll bar now when I click on it it moves accordingly and if we\n27:07 look at the workings now it's at position zero the next thing I need to do is insert a list of dates in this row\n27:15 now I'm going to use the sequence function for this this is a new function available in Office 365 if you don't\n27:22 have Office 365 then there are alternatives and I Do cover those in my\n27:27 Excel dashboard course so I want to automatically create a sequence of dates\n27:32 I only want them in one row so the first argument is one how many columns of dates well I'm going to grow out 26\n27:39 columns that's nearly four weeks that will do the start well what's the\n27:45 earliest date I need to use the Min function to find the earliest date in my\n27:52 list here and allowing for growth but remember we've got this scroll bar in here so we want want to take account of\n27:58 the scroll position so I'm going to add the scroll bar position and then the next argument is\n28:07 simply the step so here I want the step just to be one day at a time so close\n28:14 parentheses and you can see it's added in the dates they're not all formatted correctly so let me go ahead and do that\n28:21 we use a custom number format day day month month month and click okay okay all right\n28:28 let's also format them so they're all centered in that row so they're my dates\n28:33 now if you keep an eye on them as I click in the scroll bar the dates are updating that's because it's adding the\n28:40 value from the scroll bar all right we're ready to do the conditional formatting so first let me add some data\n28:48 bars to the progress that will just give us a nice visual indicator of the progress rather than having to read the\n28:54 percentages so conditional formatting data bars and we'll just do this one with solid fill now I don't particularly\n29:01 like the color so I'm going to go in and manage the rule double click to open the\n29:07 editing dialogue where I can select this color which is in keeping with my theme\n29:13 and we'll click okay so that's quick and easy and as this changes these data buzs\n29:19 will automatically adjust now I need to continue this formatting across my column in fact I\n29:26 haven't sent those so let's do that as well and we'll use conditional formatting to do that that way if this\n29:33 grows then the conditional formatting will adjust as well rather than hard\n29:38 keying the formatting if you like so we'll go conditional formatting new rule here I need to use a formula to\n29:46 determine which cells to format and the formula is really simple I just want to\n29:52 check whether this cell here and I need to change the absolute reference so that it's only f fixed on the row and not the\n29:58 column is not equal to blank so I'll give it this gray\n30:05 fill and I just want to distinguish each day's column area so we're just going to\n30:11 use white and we'll give it a border a vertical border and that will just give it a more defined look the other thing\n30:18 we need to do is put in a freeze pane so on The View tab just going to freeze row\n30:24 five and that way when we scroll down all the data and our header remains in\n30:29 place we're ready to apply the conditional formatting for our tasks so\n30:35 the first thing I want to do is select all the cells that I want the formatting applied to and we'll go out to column\n30:43 AJ I've allowed for growth going down to row 50 but obviously you can allow for\n30:48 more growth if you need so here again hom tab conditional formatting new rule\n30:56 it's a formula based rule so here I want to let me move this across here\n31:01 highlight which days in this calendar are weekend dates so we're going to use\n31:07 the weekday function for this but I need multiple criteria so I need the and function and then weekday so weekday\n31:15 Returns the day number based on a calendar that you specify similar to the workday International function so I need\n31:23 to select the first date and then just absolute the row and the calendar that I\n31:29 want to use is the second calendar that specifies my weekends are Saturday and Sunday so all I need to do is test that\n31:38 the weekday number is greater than five when you specify two as the weekday type\n31:45 it numbers Monday is 1 through to Sunday is 7 so Saturday is 6 and Sunday is 7\n31:51 therefore any days greater than five are the weekend dates the other criteria I want to check\n31:57 check is that I actually have a task on this row because as we scroll down rows\n32:03 47 through 50 have no tasks but I don't want the weekend format to flow through to those days unless there's actually a\n32:11 task so I'm going to Absolute just the column and check that it's not blank so\n32:16 we'll close the and and let's go ahead and format them with a pattern that just\n32:23 hashes out those dates I'll click okay and you can see my weekend days are now\n32:29 formatted the next formatting is for the completed days so again conditional\n32:34 formatting new rule based on a formula again equals and so here I want to test\n32:42 which days have tasks that are in progress and color them with a green fill so we need to check whether the\n32:49 date and I just want to Absolute the row is greater than or equal\n32:54 to the start date and I want to Absolute just the column and I need to check that\n33:02 this state is greater than or equal to the current days completed so we're\n33:07 going to use workday International like I did to calculate the end dat of the project taking the start date absolute\n33:16 the column plus the days completed absolute the column using the date type\n33:25 one which specif Saturday and Sundays as my weekends minus one because we need to\n33:32 include the start date in our range and if I don't minus one from this calculation it will calculate from the\n33:40 start date not inclusive of it so we'll check that it's greater than or equal to\n33:45 the current date absolute just the row close parentheses on my\n33:50 and now I can go ahead and apply the format so I want this green fill color\n33:56 and I'm going to to apply a white border top and bottom just to give a bit more definition to the fill and I'll click\n34:04 okay so now we have our completed days notice that it's sitting behind the\n34:10 weekend dates that's okay we're going to fix that in a little while the next conditional format we need to apply is\n34:18 for the in progress so let me just select all the cells again I'll scroll back up to the\n34:25 top all right conditional formatting new rule based on a formula again you'll notice that they\n34:32 also use a similar formula so we need multiple criteria again I need and and\n34:38 I'm checking whether the date in the first cell absolute just the row is\n34:44 greater than or equal to work day international taking the start date\n34:51 absolute the column plus the days completed absolute the column based on\n34:58 type one and that the progress absolute the column is not equal to one because\n35:06 it's not complete it's in progress and the date absolute the row is less\n35:14 than or equal to the end date absolute the column now I'm just using F4 to\n35:21 Absolute those fields close my parentheses and let's go ahead and\n35:26 format it again we'll use a white top and bottom border and the fill color\n35:31 this time is pink so click okay and okay again so we've got our completed in\n35:37 green our in progress in pink and we need these not started Fields conditionally formatted next so new rule\n35:44 using formula equals and so we need to check that the date absolute the row is\n35:51 greater than or equal to workday International taking the start date\n35:58 absolute the column plus the days completed absolute the column based on\n36:04 type one and progress absolute the column is equal to zero we're looking\n36:12 for projects that aren't started and the current date absolute the row is less\n36:18 than or equal to the end date absolute column close parentheses and then we\n36:25 just format it no fill but we want the pink\n36:31 border click okay and okay again now we can't see it and that's because the\n36:36 order of our conditional formatting isn't correct so I'm going to go into the conditional formatting and manage\n36:41 the rules so here I need to bring the weekend rule to the top and click stop\n36:48 of true and when we do this you'll notice that these green bars go away so click\n36:53 apply now I need to also set this one on as stop as true and that way it will be\n36:58 applied before this fill color and now you can see the formatting for the knot\n37:04 started is applied and then this one is never evaluated because it stops if it's true I'll click okay and that's our\n37:12 conditional formatting almost done one thing I'd like to do is continue on this\n37:17 gray fill across the grand total row but because that grand total row can change\n37:22 depending on which project you have selected I need to use condition formatting for that as well so again I'm\n37:30 going to go down and select the fields that I want formatted and then conditional\n37:37 formatting new rule based on a formula here I want to check whether\n37:44 this row this cell here absolute the column only contains the text grand\n37:51 total and here I want to apply the formatting this is going to have this gray fill and we'll give it a top border\n37:59 I think it's this darker gray here so click okay and okay again and you can\n38:04 see now it's formatted with the gray fill and if I change my filter you can\n38:10 see that that formatting moves with the bottom of the pivot table one thing I forgot to do was just\n38:18 abbreviate this label so that it fits in more easily of course with dashboards like\n38:24 this the data is being updated all the time and by formatting The Source data in an Excel table you're making that job super\n38:31 easy for example let's say I have some new tasks to add to project vager we can see at the moment there's only five\n38:38 tasks all I need to do is add that data to the bottom of my table or I can\n38:44 insert new rows I've got some data copied to my clipboard so I'm just going to contrl + V to paste it in can see the\n38:50 formula has copied down likewise for the progress now if I go back to the\n38:56 dashboard all I need to do is go to the data Tab and click on the refresh all\n39:01 button and you'll see not only will the pivot table update but so with all of these charts click refresh all and now\n39:09 my two new tasks have been added and this also applies to any changes you\n39:14 make to existing task progress so you can see updating your dashboards when you build them with Excel tables and\n39:20 pivot tables is super fast now I know I ran through that quite\n39:26 quickly but remember you can download the file at the link in the video description you'll find it contains\n39:33 step-by-step instructions with screenshots as well as more resources including links to tutorials
