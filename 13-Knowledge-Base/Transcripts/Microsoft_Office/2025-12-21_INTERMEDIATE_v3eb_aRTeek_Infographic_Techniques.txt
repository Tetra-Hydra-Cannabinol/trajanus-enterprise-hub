0:00 in this tutorial I'm going to share with
0:02 you some hidden Excel chart techniques
0:05 that will make your reports stand out
0:07 and draw your readers in these
0:09 techniques are often used for
0:10 infographic star reports that's not to
0:13 say you can't use them in dashboards or
0:15 even PowerPoint presentations now to
0:18 demonstrate I'll be building this
0:20 infographic on Australian B data now
0:22 infographics are oneof brocher style
0:25 reports that are designed to impart
0:27 information quickly and clearly they
0:29 often a combination of pictures charts
0:32 and text to tell a story that takes the
0:34 reader on a
0:36 journey as you can see this is just a
0:38 regular Excel file there's no addin
0:40 required to build an infographic in
0:42 Excel I'll rename this sheet
0:45 infographic and the first thing I want
0:47 to do is change the color theme to
0:50 Something in line with the theme of my
0:53 infographic and it's bees so I'm going
0:55 to go with this yellow color theme and
0:57 all that's going to do is save me some
0:58 time because now all my color palettes
1:00 are filled with colors in line with my
1:03 theme so it'll be quick and easy for me
1:05 to select them I'm going to apply a
1:09 background fill to the
1:11 cells and we're going to use this pale
1:15 yellow now I found an image of honeycomb
1:18 on pngtree.com so I'm going to insert
1:22 that I've already saved it to my PC and
1:26 it's this on here now it's a little bit
1:29 big so I'm going to start by cropping it
1:30 so on the picture format tab I'm going
1:32 to crop and we'll just reduce it
1:39 down just dragging the pull
1:42 handles okay let's reposition it to the
1:46 top of the page and I'm going to copy it
1:49 by holding down control and then I'm
1:51 going to hold down shift that'll just
1:53 keep it horizontally aligned and now it
1:56 fills the space of my header we need to
1:59 create attribute it to PNG tree.com so
2:02 I'll just make a note of that
2:04 here and we'll just make it a little bit
2:07 smaller and apply a brown font just to
2:10 make it a little bit more
2:11 subtle next I'll insert a text box to
2:15 store my header in for the infographic
2:19 so this is Australian
2:20 honeybees and let's format the font
2:23 we'll make it 80 point and we can choose
2:26 from various fonts and you can see you
2:30 go through it gives you a little
2:32 preview I know the one that I want it's
2:35 called curls and it says on here let's
2:39 format it brown and we'll just Center
2:40 the font in the text box and now I can
2:44 go ahead and hide the text box by
2:47 getting rid of the fill and the outline
2:49 so there's my header it's all done just
2:52 going to zoom out a little bit so I can
2:54 see more of the screen let's have a look
2:56 at the data now the first chart I want
2:59 to insert is a donut chart that shows
3:02 the commercial honey production by state
3:05 in Australia and we'll go to the insert
3:08 Tab and then under the pie chart we've
3:10 got donut here let's just apply some
3:13 formatting so start with making the
3:15 whole size smaller so control one to
3:17 open the formatting pane it's over here
3:19 on the right so I'm just going to drag
3:20 it over beside the chart and I want the
3:24 explosion to be
3:26 8% and the whole size to be 50
3:30 now with the donut selected I'm going to
3:32 go ahead and apply some
3:35 outlines in this brown color and I want
3:38 it to have a sketched look so we're
3:40 going to apply the sketch format just
3:43 gives it a bit more of a handdrawn
3:45 effect and add some interest to the
3:47 Chart now normally I'd limit pie or
3:50 donut charts to three slices but these
3:52 segments are quite easily distinguished
3:54 by size and with infographics the visual
3:57 appeal of a graphic holds more weight
3:59 than in a dashboard report where you
4:01 want your users to be able to interpret
4:03 the data at a glance so we can have a
4:05 little bit more fun with the
4:06 infographics I'm going to get rid of the
4:08 legend and instead add data labels let's
4:11 just go into more options and then in
4:13 here I'm going to include the category
4:15 name I don't want the leader lines and
4:18 instead of having a comma separator I'm
4:20 going to put it onto a new line and then
4:23 unfortunately with donut charts there's
4:26 no setting to put the labels outside so
4:29 you have to left click and drag them out
4:32 manually one by
4:34 one another reason not to have too many
4:37 segments in your charts okay with the
4:40 outside of the chart selected I'm going
4:42 to go and do the font formatting so I
4:43 want it all in the brown font and I'm
4:46 going to use this Zilla slab semi bold
4:49 it's one I've used earlier so that's in
4:50 my recently used fonts with that done
4:53 I'm going to crl X to cut it and I'm
4:56 just going to paste it in here on my
4:59 infograph graphic so let's make it a bit
5:01 bigger I've got plenty of
5:03 space give the chart a title commercial
5:07 honey production in tons and let's make
5:10 the font bigger can also make this font
5:12 for the labels bigger and I don't want
5:15 the Border or the fill on the chart so
5:17 let's go ahead and we'll set it to no
5:19 fill and no outline I've got the
5:22 individual values for each state but I'd
5:25 like to also include a total so I'm just
5:27 going to add a text box here
5:30 the outer edge of the text box selected
5:32 in the formula bar type equals and then
5:35 I'm going to go to the data Tab and pick
5:37 up the value press enter and there it is
5:40 in the text box let's give it some
5:42 formatting so we'll just Center it first
5:44 of all and we'll make the font bigger
5:47 and let's go with the theme font of the
5:50 Zilla slab and we'll make it
5:54 brown let's just Center that text box
5:57 and then we can go ahead and get rid of
5:58 the fill and the the outline so there's
6:01 the first chart done let's go ahead and
6:03 insert the pie chart next which is
6:05 showing the proportion of Honey produced
6:07 by land type so I'm going to insert pie
6:10 chart and I'm just going to cut this out
6:13 straight away CR X and place it on the
6:15 dashboard here let's make it bigger to
6:20 fit
6:21 in in line with the donut now I want
6:24 most of the formatting that I have on
6:26 the donut chart also on the pie chart so
6:28 I'm just going to copy the donut with
6:30 the outer edge of the chart selected
6:32 click on the pie chart and then paste
6:35 special formats now this is going to
6:37 change it to a donut but we'll change it
6:39 back don't worry but notice it's already
6:42 applied all of the formatting that I
6:43 want we go into chart design change
6:46 chart type and we'll make it a p now I
6:50 need to set the pi explosion so with
6:52 it's selected on the series options I
6:55 want to set the explosion here to
6:58 5% that just gives the handdrawn line
7:01 some space let's fix the location of the
7:04 data
7:06 labels so we're going to set them to
7:08 outside the end and let's just make this
7:11 one wider so it doesn't wrap onto three
7:15 lines and that'll just allow it to sit
7:17 closer to the Chart we'll give the chart
7:19 the title honey produced by land
7:22 type you might need to tweak the
7:25 position of the labels or even possibly
7:28 make the chart a little bit smaller just
7:30 to give them space okay so that's the
7:33 first two charts done I'll just scroll
7:35 down the next chart I need is the bar
7:38 chart and that's going to plot this data
7:41 here the number of beekeepers and the
7:43 number of hives now it's actually two
7:45 charts one for the beekeepers and one
7:47 for the hives I've plotted the hives as
7:50 negative values so that they sit on the
7:52 left hand side of the axis I'm just
7:54 going to insert them one at a time so
7:56 insert
7:58 bar
7:59 and then let's do this one I don't want
8:02 the labels here I just want the bars so
8:04 I'm just going to insert the bar without
8:06 the label selected and then notice the
8:09 hives sit on the left side with the
8:11 beekeepers on the right so I'm just
8:13 going to format one chart and then I'm
8:15 going to copy the formats again so with
8:18 it selected I don't want grid lines I
8:22 want data labels let's select the bars
8:26 and go ahead and change the Gap where
8:29 just to make them thicker so give it 50%
8:32 Gap width I don't need the horizontal
8:34 axis because I have data label so let's
8:36 remove that now although it's not
8:39 necessary to add some interest we can
8:41 color each bar separately I wouldn't
8:43 recommend this in a business dashboard
8:45 unless you're carrying the color coding
8:46 of the different states through to other
8:48 charts to color code each bar separately
8:50 select them once by left clicking and
8:53 then left click again once to select the
8:55 bar you want to color and then on the
8:57 formatting I can go in and change the
8:59 fill so I'm just going to use these
9:01 colors at the top of my color
9:05 palette and what have we got a red color
9:08 we don't quite have enough colors for
9:11 all of the bars from the top so for this
9:14 last one for Northern Territory I'm
9:17 going to shade it this lighter color
9:20 orange all right now I need to add the
9:23 outline in
9:25 brown and we'll give it the sketched
9:28 effect let's set the font so Brown might
9:32 make it a bit bigger and we'll use the
9:34 Zilla slab semi bold this font can be
9:38 bigger as well cuz it's the
9:40 title and lastly I'm going to get rid of
9:42 the fill and the outline on the chart
9:46 okay so that's that one done with it
9:48 selected on the outside I'm going to
9:50 contrl C to copy and then I'm going to
9:53 paste special
9:56 formats let's select them both and crl X
9:59 to cut them out and we'll paste them in
10:01 here where we can see them better now
10:03 when you copy the format for some reason
10:05 it doesn't get rid of the fill in the
10:08 plot area so let's go ahead and get rid
10:11 of that I still have the vertical axis
10:14 in here for the number of hives so let's
10:16 go ahead and we'll hide the labels so
10:18 we'll set them to none and I need to fix
10:21 the number formatting here so that
10:23 they're not showing as negatives so with
10:25 them selected I want the number to be a
10:28 custom format
10:29 and I've already set it up in here but
10:32 basically the way formats work is the
10:33 first format before the semicolon is the
10:36 positive values the second format is the
10:39 negative values and then we have zero
10:41 and text in this case I'm only
10:43 formatting positive and negatives so all
10:46 I've done is remove the minus sign from
10:48 the negative value so that both positive
10:52 and negative values are formatted in the
10:54 same way okay we can make this chart a
10:56 bit bigger in fact we can make them them
10:59 both a bit bigger vertically as well and
11:02 then the last chart I need is a column
11:04 chart for my beekeeper clubs and members
11:08 so I'm going to select the data insert
11:11 column chart now you'll notice that it's
11:13 plotted the year as a series and
11:16 obviously that's not correct so right
11:17 click select data and we'll remove the
11:21 year and edit the horizontal access
11:23 labels which should be the year
11:26 values so that's fixed that
11:31 let's get rid of the grid lines We'll
11:34 add the legend to the top instead of the
11:37 bottom and then the next thing I want to
11:39 do is because the members values are
11:42 tiny I'm going to change the chart type
11:44 so let's change chart type and we'll go
11:46 with a combo chart and we'll have the
11:48 clubs as a cluster column and the
11:50 members as a line chart on the secondary
11:52 axis now I want to add data labels for
11:55 the columns so let's do that data labels
11:57 and we'll put them inside the base let's
12:00 fix these columns cuz they're a bit
12:02 narrow so we'll change the Gap width to
12:06 50% and I don't want this vertical axis
12:09 now because I have labels so I don't
12:11 need that as well so let's go and hide
12:13 the labels to none and I still have this
12:18 vertical line here so let's go and hide
12:20 that put the line as no line all right
12:24 let's make the chart a bit bigger it's
12:25 going to have plenty of space we'll move
12:28 the
12:29 Legend up here and the chart title
12:32 across to the left so this is New South
12:35 Wales amateur beekeepers clubs and
12:38 members let's change the color of these
12:40 columns so that they're in line with our
12:43 theme we'll make it yellow that
12:45 contrasts better with the line I'm also
12:47 going to make the line
12:50 smooth and we'll add the
12:53 outline and make it
12:57 sketched okay now nearly there let's go
12:59 ahead and make the font Brown and we'll
13:02 change it to Zilla slab and we can
13:04 probably make it a bit bigger as well
13:06 especially this one which can be much
13:08 bigger all right let's get rid of the
13:12 shape fill on the chart and the outline
13:15 and crl
13:17 x and place it on the infographic you
13:20 see we got loads of room to play with
13:23 here make it wider all right one last
13:27 thing I want to do is just to clarify
13:29 what this vertical axis is for so we can
13:32 do that by giving it a
13:35 title so this is
13:37 members and that just makes it easier to
13:40 interpret okay now the charts are
13:42 complete we can add some more interest
13:43 to the infographic with icons and images
13:46 Excel has a load of free icons and
13:49 images available on the insert Tab and
13:51 then icons you need to be connected to
13:53 the internet for it to get them though
13:55 so all you need to do is search for a
13:58 ter or you can scroll through or look by
14:00 category I'm going to look for bees
14:04 there's one there and let's also look
14:06 for
14:07 honey there's some honey and a beehive
14:10 and I also want something that
14:13 represents a meeting for my members data
14:17 so we've got four Images there I'm going
14:18 to insert
14:22 those let's just bring them up towards
14:24 the top and'll make them a bit
14:27 bigger all right the first one I want is
14:30 this pot of honey and I'm just going to
14:33 place it in here we'll change the fill
14:35 color to a paler color you can also make
14:38 it
14:43 transparent it's sitting in front of the
14:45 charts though so let's just send it back
14:48 so that the chart data is sitting in
14:50 front of it all right so that's the one
14:52 that represents the honey let's move the
14:55 hive down here we can make it a bit
14:56 bigger and it can fill this space
14:59 let's give it a color of gold and
15:04 also give it some
15:07 transparency just to wash it out make it
15:10 less dominating all right scrolling down
15:14 to the club section this is my club
15:19 image let's make this shade of
15:22 brown and the bee can come over here
15:25 he's a bit big so we'll make him smaller
15:28 Maybe sip him on an angle and we'll make
15:31 him
15:31 yellow actually I'm going to copy the B
15:35 over
15:37 here and we'll make him much smaller
15:39 maybe
15:41 75 and he can sit on the desk at the
15:45 meeting all right now the last image I
15:48 have is this map of Australia I actually
15:52 created this using hexagon shapes so
15:55 what I did was insert the shape and and
15:58 down here I've got the hexagon and I
16:01 drew it in and then I copied it and if I
16:05 select this on the shape format tab I
16:08 can ungroup them you'll see how many
16:10 times I copied it loads of times so it
16:12 was a bit of a labor of love I'm going
16:15 controls there to undo that and then I
16:17 colorcoded each state in line with the
16:19 number of beekeeper values so Victoria
16:22 New South Wales have about the same then
16:24 Queensland then wa South Australia and
16:28 and Tasmania Northern Territory very
16:31 low so instead of recreating that I'm
16:34 just going to copy that for now and put
16:36 it in here and we'll move it into place
16:40 it's a bit
16:42 big all right you could also use a map
16:45 chart there is a map chart up here but I
16:49 liked the hexagons I thought they're a
16:51 bit more interesting in keeping with the
16:52 be theme and honeycomb so there's my
17:00 infographic let's just minimize the
17:03 ribbon
17:05 and I'll also get rid of the headings in
17:08 the formula bar just to give it a bit
17:11 more space on my monitor so you can see
17:14 it there I'll zoom out a little more so
17:18 there you have a load of techniques for
17:21 building infographics in Excel using
17:24 images icons charts and these cool
17:28 sketch effects on the charts to make it
17:30 a little bit more interesting I hope you
17:33 found this tutorial useful you can
