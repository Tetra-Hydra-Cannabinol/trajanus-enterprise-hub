0:00 scurve charts are a common tool used in
0:02 project management to track the
0:03 cumulative costs hours sales Etc over
0:07 time the chart forms the shape of an S
0:10 because typically progress starts slow
0:12 and ends slow with an acceleration in
0:14 the middle periods and if we look at the
0:17 discrete values which are the gray
0:19 columns you can see they make a similar
0:21 shape as a normal distribution or a bell
0:23 curve in Excel we can create scurve
0:26 charts using line or scatter chart types
0:29 let's take a look
0:31 here I have a typical list of project
0:33 tasks with their start and end dates and
0:35 durations now from this data I can
0:38 create a table that allocates the
0:39 duration days across each date in the
0:42 project period now my version of excel
0:45 has Dynamic array so I have the sequence
0:47 function available so I can generate
0:49 this list of dates automatically if you
0:51 have of Vel 2019 or earlier then you can
0:54 just manually list the dates of your
0:55 project the first argument of sequence
0:58 is how many rows I want now I only need
0:59 one one row so I can either put a one in
1:01 here or just skip that argument next it
1:04 wants to know how many columns I'm going
1:06 to calculate the number of columns by
1:08 finding the maximum end
1:11 date minus the minimum start
1:16 date close parentheses and I'm going to
1:18 plus one so that my data concludes the
1:21 very last day that's going to give me
1:23 the number of columns then I need to
1:25 tell it where to start well we can use
1:27 Min again to find the first start date
1:31 and then the step well that's just one I
1:33 can either leave that blank or put it in
1:35 let's put it in for completeness press
1:38 enter and it spills the list of dates
1:41 next I need to allocate the duration for
1:43 each task to their respective dates I
1:46 can use the IF function for this and I
1:48 want to check if the date in row one
1:50 Falls between the start and end dates
1:52 for that task now I don't have a between
1:55 function in Excel but we can use median
1:58 to kind of trick it into giving us a
2:00 between function so here I need to find
2:02 the median of the start date the end
2:05 date and the date in row one and that's
2:07 just absolute reference the row close
2:10 median and I want to check if it equals
2:14 the date in row one and again absolute
2:17 reference that if it does I want it to
2:20 return a one otherwise blank close
2:23 parentheses on if and you can see the
2:26 first date Falls within the start and
2:27 end dates by the way if you'd like to
2:29 learn how the median function is working
2:31 here there's a link in the video
2:33 description to a tutorial that goes into
2:35 more detail okay I'm going to control C
2:38 to copy and I'm just going to paste the
2:41 formula across now it's important that
2:43 you don't left click and drag because
2:45 what will happen is the references to
2:46 the table columns will also update and
2:49 shift one column to the right for each
2:51 column you copy it across you'll end up
2:53 with the wrong results so you can see
2:55 there there are my five dates for the
2:57 first task and all I need to to do is
3:00 copy this formula down to the bottom of
3:03 the
3:04 table and now we have the duration
3:07 allocated across the dates so at the
3:10 bottom I want to summarize that data so
3:13 I want to calculate the total days and
3:16 that's just a sum
3:18 formula and I want the cumulative days
3:21 and that's just going to sum this to
3:24 itself and I'm going to Absolute
3:27 reference the first part of sum and I'm
3:30 going to leave the second half relative
3:31 so that when I copy this formula across
3:34 it's going to increase by one column at
3:35 a time so let's copy
3:38 those across our table you can see if we
3:42 look at the cumulative
3:44 formula it increases the range it's
3:46 adding up by one cell at a time so
3:49 there's the data for our chart let's
3:51 give this a name and I want to select
3:53 the dates and the cumulative values
3:57 we're going to
3:58 insert I'm just going to use a 2d line
4:00 chart with
4:01 markers and there's our S curve chart
4:05 let's give it a new
4:07 name notice it's not a perfect s shape
4:10 and this is typical of most projects
4:12 especially when it comes time to
4:13 tracking the actual values if I include
4:16 the total days let me just copy those
4:18 values select the chart and contrl V let
4:21 me right click and change the series
4:23 chart type here so we'll make the total
4:25 days column chart on the secondary axis
4:29 and now you can see there's a dip in
4:30 momentum on the 22nd and 23rd of
4:32 February which explains why my S curve
4:35 is a little lumpy along the way of
4:37 course what good is plotting your planed
4:39 data without comparing your actual
4:41 progress to it the next step will be
4:43 adding your actual and forecast to the
4:45 chart in this example which uses
4:48 different data you can see the actual
4:50 Pace was faster at the beginning of the
4:52 project than budgeted but it's forecast
4:54 to come in on time and on budget now
4:58 these examples are all used live line
4:59 charts but you can just as easily create
5:02 them from scatter charts obviously you'd
5:05 want to choose one of the ones with
5:07 lines either straight lines or smooth
5:10 lines I hope you found this tutorial
