Basic of excel data analysis
0:08
microsoft excel is one of the oldest and most popular spreadsheet application for data analytics and reporting hello
0:14
everyone welcome to this full course video on data analytics in excel in this video we will learn everything from
0:20
basics to advanced in excel our experience instructor ajay will help you learn in detail
0:25
you will start off by taking a tour to welcome to excel where you will learn the basics then you will understand the various
0:32
crucial functions available in excel such as vlookup hlookup sumifs counters
0:37
if error and others you will learn how to sort and filter data in excel then we'll focus on conditional
0:44
formatting and data validation moving further you will get an idea how to create pivot tables in pure charts in
0:50
excel and finally you will see how to use the data analysis toolpak to perform various
0:56
data analysis operations such as regression sampling descriptive statistics and much more over to ajay
1:02
now hi everyone welcome to this tutorial on microsoft excel so
1:09
we will learn about functions and formulas we will learn about conditional formatting data validation pivot chart
1:16
and pivot table now let's look at a scenario here so one
1:22
day in a startup one professional speaks that their
1:27
business is growing and they would need an efficient way to work with the data
1:33
they would have to find a way to work faster with storing and analyzing data
1:40
now to that another colleague responds well we can make use of microsoft excel
1:47
to do this job the question is will excel be able to cater to
1:53
their business needs now the colleague responds well we can make
1:59
use of excel in several ways and it also is a cost efficient option
2:06
now in that case the colleague who posed the question says let's go ahead with excellent let's
2:12
train our employees in excel and the suggestion is welcomed which would
2:20
make the job easier for them and they would basically decide on using excel so they decide on
2:27
taking a training right away and basically starting to learn excel
2:32
now before we move to excel one of the question is why should we use excel
2:39
so let's look at some of the points here so excel proves to be a great platform
2:45
to perform various mathematical calculation on large data sets which is one of the biggest requirements of
2:52
various organizations these days various features in excel like searching
2:57
sorting filtering makes it easier for you to play with the data
3:03
and excel also allows you to beautify your data and present it in the form of charts tables and data
3:10
bars now when it comes to reporting reporting accounting and analysis can be performed
3:17
with the help of excel it can help you with your task lists your calendars and goal planning
3:24
worksheets excel also provides good security for your data excel files have the feature
3:30
of password protection this way your information can be safe
3:36
now when we talk about what is excel and how it can be used so excel or you might have heard a
3:44
spreadsheet can be basically used for a lot of different tasks than just
3:50
storing the information in so called tabular format
3:55
now microsoft excel is an application that is used for recording analyzing and
4:02
visualizing data it is in the form of a spreadsheet let's have a look at few of the
4:08
functions and formulas used in excel and before we do that we can also quickly
4:14
take a small tour to understand how to work with excel now to do that what we can do
Lookup & functions in excel data analysis
4:21
is we can type in in our search say for example excel and just select your excel app
4:29
which is installed and here you see you have a lot of options which says take a tour drop down list get started with
4:36
formulas make your pivot table going forward with pie charts and much more so we can click on this one which
4:43
says take a tour and that basically pops up a window which says welcome to excel and
4:51
if you have always wanted to be better at excel you have this
4:57
which can help you so let's click on create and that takes us to the store window now that says instructions for
5:04
screen readers which basically talks about 10 different steps in which we can
5:10
learn excel and using the spreadsheet app so there are more than 11 sheets
5:17
which we see here at the bottom end and each one gives us a simple example which
5:22
we can work on so for example if i click on add now that takes me to this page which
5:29
says how do we add numbers now you might be provided data which we can upload by
5:36
loading a file from our machine or getting data from a web source or even connecting to a database so there are
5:43
various options which we will see in some time so here we have an option
5:48
which is called data you can click on this one and this basically has
5:55
options where you can use existing connections if you have created some you can always click on from other sources
6:02
and you can get your data from sql server from analysis services from odata data feed you can get in from
6:10
xml from data connection wizard or also from microsoft query you can be running
6:17
in different queries here which shows up in the option which says new query there are connections which you can use
6:25
and that basically will display all the connections for this particular workbook which we
6:30
did not have as of now but we can create them but let's look at simple examples now you can follow these instructions
6:37
here which says basically adding up the numbers and that could be easily done by just placing your cursor
6:45
here and what you could do is either you can type in the formula that is
6:51
from which row to which row you would want to add the data so for example i
6:56
could just do a sum here and that shows up all the different functions which are
7:02
available then we can open up a parenthesis and we can say i would be interested in totaling the
7:08
amount from column d and i would select for example
7:15
d4 so i could be doing this and then i could say d4
7:21
onwards till d7 so that's the data which i'm interested in you can close your
7:28
parenthesis and hit enter and that gives you the total there is also a shortcut for this which
7:34
you can always do is we can first delete this and you can just place your cursor
7:40
here and just use your alt and equals that automatically selects the numericals
7:48
which we can anytime expand or basically collapse so i will
7:54
basically select this which says this function needs two numbers which is number one and number two and then you
8:00
can hit on enter and that gives you the total so similarly we can be getting in the
8:06
data here by selecting all the fields so here it also says that you can use a shortcut
8:14
now what we can also do is we can add numbers over 50 by selecting the yellow cell here
8:22
and then giving a condition such as so i can basically use something
8:27
like sum if and then open a parenthesis i can select
8:32
i would be interested in this row and then i can even drag and drop
8:39
till here so that tells me d11 to d15 you can then put in a comma here and you
8:45
can give your condition say for example we would say i would be interested in numbers only above 50 and we can select
8:54
this close your quotes and then just close your paranthesis and that's your formula
9:01
so you can do this and that basically gives me the total is hundred now similarly we could do that for the
9:08
amount here i could select this now there is also an option i can click on home and i can go for something like
9:15
auto sum so that's one more way of doing it which anyway says sum is alt plus
9:22
equals so it automatically adds up your values and i can try doing an auto sum
9:28
that automatically selects my rows and then i can get my total now as per this
9:35
activity here it says try adding another sum if formula here but add amounts that
9:40
are less than 100 and the result should be 160. so what we can do is we can
9:47
basically select all the numbers which are lesser than 100 so the way we did earlier here
9:55
there can be always a shortcut so you can always for example if you would want
10:00
to avoid typing in the formula you can always copy it from here and then
10:06
just hit on enter so you are back into this cell and then i can basically go
10:12
here and paste the number and then as per the requirement we are
10:18
required to select anything which is lesser than 100 so what i could do is i
10:23
could select here i could say let's say g and then i can change this value to g15
10:31
and that's one more way now we see our selected rows have been changed so i can
10:37
hit on enter and i can check what is the result so we would be interested in
10:43
looking for numbers which are lesser than 100 so i will have to also change
10:48
this one to a lesser sign and that basically gives me the total which is
10:55
160 so that's how you can simply add numbers you can use autosum you can type in the
11:02
formula you can select the fields or you can just place your cursor where
11:08
you would be looking for a sum and then you can just do a alt equals and that
11:13
basically populates the sum
11:19
now let's look at some easy options of filling your cells
11:25
or automatically populating the values in your cells within your excel sheet now here
11:32
we have an option with says 100 now we can click on this and that basically
11:38
says it is making a sum of column c4 to d4 so if i click on this
11:45
one i can check that this is row number 4 which shows up here and i also know this
11:53
is column c i also have d so this equals is basically giving me a sum of c4 to d4
12:00
now what we can do is we can always place our cursor here at the right
12:06
corner and then we can just drag and drop and this basically gives me a total
12:12
of all the numbers for all different rows so this is one shortcut which we can do
12:19
to get the total excel will automatically give the totals which we call as filling down
12:26
now what we can do is in the same way if we would want to get the totals here we
12:31
can first check what is this 200 and this tells me it is c 11 to c 14 total
12:38
so it is totaling the rows from c11 so column c and 11th row till 14th row and
12:45
that's the sum now what i can also do is i can similarly like above we can do a
12:52
filling right which basically means bringing your cursor here and then just
12:57
dragging and dropping it all the way where you would need the totals and this basically gives me the total there is
13:04
one more quick way to check if this is right so the easiest option would be to select
13:10
this cell now what i can also do is i can just select all of these fields by
13:17
just highlighting and selecting all the fields once it is selected press on control r and that gives you
13:24
the total now if we would be doing this top down then i could select all these
13:30
rows for this particular column and then i could do a ctrl d so that's your
13:35
filling down and this one was filling right so this is an easier option of
13:41
doing a fill when you would want to have the formula applied to every row as it occurs
13:48
in the first row or the last row we could test this by for example selecting
13:55
these fields i could delete them and i have here which says 130 i could just
14:01
place my cursor here and i could drag it all the way up and that should also do
14:06
the same magic which we were seeing from top down so this is a simple way wherein
14:12
you can fill up your cells and you can also automatically
14:18
propagate or move your computation to all the cells
14:24
let's look at the split option which basically helps us in splitting the data when we
14:30
have some kind of pattern or when we have some kind of delimiters in our data
14:35
in say one particular column and we would want to derive the values out of
14:40
it so we can always use the splitting option now the easiest option would be
14:46
so for example we have our email column which has the email ids and which we can
14:51
clearly see has a first name dot last name now i see that there is a last name
14:57
smith filled up here first name is empty so what i can also do is i can just type
15:03
in say nancy here now that's the first name i can again
15:09
start typing the second name and as soon as you do that you would see a faded
15:15
list of numbers and that's your clue to hit enter and once you do that you would
15:20
see all the first names have been filled in here if you would want to maintain the case sensitiveness you can just go
15:28
ahead and delete these and let's type in as it occurs so let's say nancy as the
15:34
first name go down to the next cell and just type in andy and there is your
15:39
grade list so just hit on enter and that basically fills up your first name
15:44
what we can also do is we can just select this particular field
15:51
and either we can type in control e which basically fills up all the options
15:56
now i can just do a undo by typing in or clicking control z and that's basically
16:02
gone what i can also do is i can select a particular field and then i can go into
16:10
home option and under home you should have an option here which says fill so you can select this and
16:17
then you can do a flash fill which is what we are doing here so click on flash
16:22
fill and that automatically fills up the values so in this way you can work
16:27
within your spreadsheet and you can be filling up the values where a delimiter
16:32
by default is understood and we can split the data now however sometimes you
16:37
might have some data which has a different kind of delimiter and there is again a smarter way of splitting your
16:44
data so you can always scroll down here and that says splitting a column based on
16:49
delimiters so we have some values in the data column and
16:54
these values in each row are separated by comma so select this
17:01
your data is already selected text to columns delimited comma is selected
17:07
and now click on next so it basically says what is the destination let's select
17:13
this one and i can choose what would you want to have so that
17:19
shows me this would be my data preview now i can basically select this one
17:25
i can say finish and say okay and now if you see our data has been
17:32
placed in in the columns appropriately so this is how you can split your data based on a
17:37
delimiter and then organize your data in a better way now there are some advanced
17:43
options which we can learn later but this basically tells about using a formula so this is something if say if
17:50
we have some name in one cell and if you would want to split it into first name
17:56
your helper column your middle name last name so that can also be done using formulas and this
18:04
basically tells how would you extract characters from your left
18:09
cell and how would you place them in your right cell so you can try this activity which is a little more of
18:15
advanced option the benefit is that you can always use this
18:20
wherein if you do some kind of transformation using your formulas if your original data gets
18:28
updated then the split data will also get updated and that's the benefit of
18:34
using formulas where you can place values from one cell into multiple cells
18:40
based on execution of your details in the formulas how about using the transpose option now
18:49
you might have heard of situations where you would want to switch or turn your rows into columns
18:56
and your columns into rows and that's where transposing comes into picture it might be useful when you have your data
19:04
in your x and y axis or as i would say in rows and columns and you would want to switch your rows to become the
19:10
columns and columns to become your rows so what we can do is the simplest way is you can
19:17
select all your values so here we basically have six
19:23
columns and i would say two rows now i can select all of these and then i can select an empty field for example the
19:30
one which is highlighted here well you can always do a ctrl alt v that's a
19:36
shortcut what you can also do is once you have selected all your fields
19:41
you can just copy them so just do a ctrl c and then click on an empty cell and then
19:48
what you can do is you can do a special paste or paste special so under your
19:53
home you have the paste option and here you can go for paste special and once
19:59
you do that you need to select the transpose option over here and click on
20:04
ok and now you will see that the columns and the rows have been transposed so
20:11
your row name was item and that has become the column heading you had row name as amount and that has become the
20:18
column heading and all your values have been transposed in
20:23
this particular format now there is another way of doing that and again that's using your formulas so what you
20:30
can do is you can transpose with a formula also and that basically
20:36
works when you have similar kind of data so this has six columns
20:42
and basically two rows so you can basically do this so you can select this
20:48
and earlier we were doing a copy but now what we would want to do is we would want to just look at the row numbers
20:55
which tells me it is c33c34 and it starts with c and ends in with
21:02
your h column so what we can do is we know that we have six columns and two
21:08
rows so transposing that would actually give me two columns and six rows so what
21:15
we can do is we can select two columns and six rows in our excel sheet i can
21:23
then basically start typing in the message or i can just go to the address bar and here
21:29
i can say transpose
21:34
let's go for c33 h34 it basically selects my data and now i can just do a
21:44
control shift and enter and now if you see all the values have been populated
21:50
now you can just place your cursor in one of the cells but if you see the address bar the formula remains the same
21:57
this is because this is an array formula so we can read more about an array
22:03
formula here it's basically something which performs calculations and on more
22:08
than one cell in an array and in the example here the array is the
22:13
original data that is c33 to h34 so your transpose is just changing
22:20
the horizontal orientation to the vertical orientation so this is a very
22:25
simple way in which you can basically use the excel's capability to transpose
22:31
your data and convert your rows into columns and columns into rows
22:37
apart from working on additions subtractions filling up your
22:44
data sorting the data or basically splitting your
22:49
data transposing your data one of the other requirements is sorting and filtering
22:55
your data now that can be very handy when you're working on huge data and you would want to sort it in a particular
23:01
order say ascending or descending or might be based on a particular field or
23:06
if that field was or if the cell was highlighted with a particular color sorting the data so let's look at how
23:14
excel can be used for sorting and filtering examples are pretty simple here so
23:20
let's check that so if we're going to sort and filter and say this is the data i have say for example i would want to
23:27
sort the values in the department column alphabetically so what i can do is i can
23:33
select department column and i'm already in the home tab i can straight away go
23:39
here which says sort and filter i can then say sort a to z and that's
23:44
basically alphabetically sorting your department column and once once i do this you would see
23:51
the data has been sorted but it's not just this data we can just do a control
23:56
z and check what are the values we have so here we have meat which is beef and
24:01
90 ten thousand the values then you have bakery which should
24:07
ideally be the first row if we sort it in alphabetical order which goes with bakery as deserts you
24:14
have the values so we can check this again so select department and then just
24:20
with sort and filter and let's say sort a to z and if you see the data has changed but
24:25
it's not just in changing your first column but then it has taken care of all
24:31
the data however the data has been sorted based on the department column so you have
24:36
bakery which aligns with deserts which has the values and now we have all the data
24:42
which has been filtered now what we can also do is we can sort december's
24:48
amounts from largest to smallest so what we can do is we can basically click any
24:55
cell in the december column let's say 20 000 and then what i can do is i can go into
25:01
sort filter and then i can say sort largest to smallest so if you see bakery breads
25:09
is the row which has the smallest data or maybe you have delhi sandwiches so
25:15
that one looks also smaller so let's do a larger to smallest and if i do this you
25:22
would see the values have been shifted now so it is no more based on the department column
25:29
because now the data is being sorted based on the values in the december column and you see bakery which was
25:37
alphabetically the first one has become second last so either you can sort the data based on
25:44
a department column which goes based on the values these are all string
25:49
values or words so it sorts alphabetically if you have numbers might
25:54
be you can give some values and you can sort the data you could anytime do a custom sort and
26:04
you could basically select if you would want to select the data so
26:09
i could do a custom sort and then i could choose which is the column which we would want
26:15
to use for sorting what is the sorting needs to be done is it cell values is it
26:21
cell color font color conditional formatting and then you can also choose
26:26
the order so that's one more way to do that now if you scroll down that also shows
26:31
how you can sort by date or a color so for example if you would want to sort
26:38
based on the expense date so there are different options so what i can do is i
26:43
can select this date field i can just do a right click i can go into sort and
26:49
then i can choose i would want to sort oldest to newest so since i selected the
26:55
date field it basically has sorted all the data and it has taken the expense date into
27:02
consideration now there are these filters which you see on the row headings we could have also used those
27:09
so i could have selected this and that basically says or mentions which are the
27:15
dates i would be interested in looking at i also have sort by color here
27:20
i can do a sort oldest to newest or newest to oldest so i could also use these filters which have been applied
27:28
here now we have the data which is in color so if i would want to basically
27:34
select the color columns or color cells i could select this i can basically do a right
27:40
click here and when i go into sort i could choose put selected color or cell color on the
27:48
top and that basically will make sure that my data is sorted and it has also sorted
27:54
that in a descending order so in this way you can sort or basically filter
28:00
your data what we can also do is we can add filters so sometimes we can go for
28:05
formulas which we would want to use what we can also do is we can
28:11
basically select the filter which has been applied here now how does the filter come in there so if i would
28:18
select a particular row i could select a particular row and then
28:23
i could decide if i would want to just add a filter to this one and that's how the filter has come in so we have the
28:30
filter what we can do is we can basically click on this drop down
28:35
and then you have something like number filters so we can always go here we can
28:41
basically choose one of these so we can basically choose above average so i
28:47
could select this and then basically it shows me the values we could also delete
28:53
the filter by clicking on this one and we could say well i'm not interested in this filter anymore so i could clear the
29:00
filter and that shows me all the values or i could say
29:06
that let's click on some other field for example food i can go in here i can go
29:13
into number filters and then i could say well i'm interested in
29:18
values which are below average above average might be greater than and then i
29:24
can choose what is the value so for example if we say i am interested in food which is greater than 25 dollars i
29:32
could give a value here i could say ok and now i have applied the filter
29:38
similarly you can select this and then you can just clear your filter and your data is back
29:44
so remember no data is lost it is just hidden or basically based on
29:51
the filter not shown so that's good enough for us and in this way you can sort and filter the data so
29:58
for more details obviously in all the sheets you have the links which point to more information on the web and you can
30:05
always refer to these so this is simple way in which you can sort and filter any
30:12
amount of data which has been stored within your excel within a particular sheet now that we have learned about add
30:20
fill split transpose sorting and filtering it will also be good to learn
30:26
how to work with tables or basically converting your data into a tabular format and then doing some easy
30:33
computations so click on this tables option here now here we see there is
30:38
some data which is in five columns and n number of rows so i
30:45
can basically select this data and then what i can do is i can insert
30:51
choose the table option and then it says my table as headers and
30:56
we'll be okay with that i'll say okay and now if you see this is the table
31:01
created it basically has different filters which we have learnt earlier how
31:06
to use and this is basically my table which is a collection of cells which has
31:12
some special features so we can easily add rows to this table we can add columns to this table and we
31:19
can even do some calculations so for example here i can click on this one i
31:25
can basically enter some field and then i can hit on enter and we see that this
31:32
row has been inserted wherein we can easily fill in values for example i would say chocolates
31:40
i could give some value here size 25 000 might be 35 000
31:47
and then basically i can given some values here now what you can also do is you can
31:54
continue adding rows in this way and say for example you would want more
32:00
columns so you can select this option here in the top bottom right
32:06
corner you can just drag it towards the right and that basically has
32:12
automatically created columns for my next month
32:17
wherein i can feed in the data so this is a simpler way wherein you can keep
32:23
adding more rows and columns to your data if that has been converted in a tabular format now let me just do a ctrl
32:31
z that basically deletes the columns again ctrl z deletes the last row which
32:37
we added and i can stop here or i can even remove my values by doing multiple
32:42
control z and removing my rows so this is how i converted my data into a table and
32:50
then i can easily work on this what i can also do is i can do some calculations so what we can do
32:57
we have a table here we have a total field and what we can do is we can just
33:03
select one cell here now as we have learned earlier we can do a alt and then
33:09
equals and that basically says what is this doing so it says it is
33:15
calculating the sum of the last three months and if that's what you would want to do just hit on enter
33:23
and it has automatically calculated the totals for
33:28
all your rows for these three columns so the sum formula is getting filled up
33:34
now i can select any particular cell and i can look in my address bar so it has already given me the formula where it
33:42
has started calculating the sum from the october column till the december column and has
33:50
given me the calculated values of the columns what we can also do is we can
33:55
get total rows in the table now that's a simpler option so what we can do is we
34:02
can select any cell in this particular table and then we see that there is a table
34:09
tools design option showing up here now i can select this and then it says well
34:15
let's get a total row so let's select this and it automatically populates the total here
34:22
and if you would want the average then we could select this and from the drop
34:27
down i can select what i'm interested in so for example i would want the average
34:33
values and not the total i could just select this and that gives me the average of these values
34:40
so we can always do simpler computations here by converting our data into table format
34:48
let's learn about one more efficient way of working with the data and that's
34:54
using your drop downs so let's see how drop downs work here
34:59
now say for example you have this data which has the values in the food column and
35:04
department is empty and say for example you would want to enter the values in department however
35:12
you would want to select the department should either have produce or meat and bakery and these are
35:19
the only three options which should be available for any user to fill in the
35:24
values how do we do that so we can basically create a table by
35:31
pressing ctrl d so what i can do is under my department
35:36
here i can select one of the cells and then i can do a control t that
35:42
basically converts this into a table i can say okay and my table is created now
35:47
what i can do is once this part is done we can
35:53
select all the blank fields here where we would want this drop down to be applicable
35:59
now under your data tab you can go in and select data validation and this has
36:05
an option called data validation click on this which basically says allow any value so
36:11
here i will select i would want to give a list of values and then i can type in
36:16
my values here which i can say produce say for example meat and then say
36:24
bakery now these are the values so we can click on ok
36:30
and once we have done that we basically have a drop down here next to apples
36:36
which will only show us the values which we can feed in under the department
36:42
column so i can go into every cell and then i can basically choose
36:47
what is the department which handles this and then basically i can select one of
36:52
these from the drop down so this is an easier option of creating your drop down
36:59
and then feeding in the values from the set of values which you have defined
37:05
here on the right so this is a simple example of using your drop downs
37:10
working with your tables working with your sort and filter transpose split
37:16
filling up your data adding in some data here and similarly you can use excel for
37:23
more than one use case using its inbuilt features to easily work with your data
37:30
let's see how we can import data or bring in data into our excel from
37:37
your local machine or from an external web source so what we can do is we can open up a
37:44
blank excel sheet and say for example you have been provided a text file or a
37:51
csv file and you would want to import that data into your excel sheet that can
37:56
be easily done so right now i've opened an excel sheet now i can click on data and
38:03
here i have an option which says existing connections from other data sources
38:08
so or you can click on connections if you have already created some so we can click on from other sources
38:15
so this is one option where you can connect to your different data sources and you can get the data
38:21
from one of these what we can also do is i can click on connections now it says
38:28
there is none i can click on add it says well show the connections where
38:34
connection files on network connection files on this computer so i
38:40
can say let's get some files from this computer now if that does not show up something so
38:46
say browse for more and that basically shows you different options so let's basically select a
38:53
folder where i have some data sets i'll click in here
38:58
and this is basically a folder where i have some data sets now let me select
39:04
this particular file and i know it is a csv file so let's click on
39:11
open now if you would want to verify this you could have gone and looked into the properties of the file and it says
39:17
it is a dot csv file which is what we are interested in so i'll take this file
39:23
i'll say open now this basically shows me the text import wizard option which says
39:29
is the file delimited i'll say yes click on next so i will select comma as
39:36
my delimiter i can say text qualifier is none now this is my data so my data preview
39:43
is already showing me the data is what is the data in the csv file you can
39:49
click on next and then you have an option which says data format is general
39:54
you can go for date format you can go for advanced options so i'll just say finish
40:01
and basically now this has been created here so we basically have this and now i can
40:08
click on close now once you have done that you can click on existing connections it
40:15
shows me the data which we have here the connection which we have created say open
40:21
and then it says do you want to import this data or bring this data into
40:27
existing worksheet you can also say add this to a data model if you are doing some data
40:32
modeling so click on ok and now this data is automatically
40:38
inserted in my excel file i can basically save it
40:43
into this particular sheet now what we can also do is we can also start a new sheet
40:50
and that does not have a data and we can get some other data from web so what i
40:56
can do is i can go into my github and let's say i would be interested in
41:01
this csv file so i can select this and this is my github path a path on web
41:08
so i can click on draw and that basically gives me the raw path where this particular file
41:15
is now you can select this copy this particular path and here you can come back to your excel
41:22
sheet we would be interested in getting the data from web might be from a text file where we will have to specify the
41:28
delimiters or let's go to web and here i can given the web path from where i
41:35
would be interested in getting the file let's give the github path which is publicly available and then click on
41:42
import now once you click on import it tells me there are two fields data and
41:47
value these are within double quotes separated by comma
41:53
so first let's click on import now once we do this it will basically
41:59
get the data from web and put in here it says existing worksheet so we had
42:04
already created a new worksheet so let's click on ok and now you have the data coming in but
42:11
then this basically shows me in one particular field so what we can also do
42:17
is we can just do a control a that selects all my columns here and that's my data so we can then
42:25
basically filter this out so we can say text to columns
42:31
it's a delimited file click on next we can select comma and
42:37
let the text qualifier be quotes it shows me data preview click on next so you have the
42:45
general format it shows the destination that's the column click on finish and now your data has
42:52
been split and you have the data which you have imported from web so this is
42:57
the data which is coming in from web this is the data which came in from my local machine and similarly we can even
43:04
create connection with an existing database so i can basically click on connections
43:11
if i would want to do that so i have an option called connection here and it says where the selected
43:18
connections are used i can basically click on add i can basically choose
43:25
if i would want to get the files from network or from computer like we did earlier
43:30
i can click on browse for more which should show me
43:36
different other options to create connections say you would want to create a new sql server connection
43:42
you can connect to a new data source coming in from different place you could basically choose what kind of
43:48
connection you would you want so these are all the different options which we can go for and we can basically connect
43:56
to a database for example if i have some database
44:01
and say for example access database i can see if there are some files with
44:07
that particular database and i can import it so similarly we can also
44:14
uh click in here which says new query and that also gives you an option of getting the data from your files from
44:21
all these folders from databases so you can basically click here and then you
44:27
can import data from a mysql database provided that is set up on your local
44:33
machine or on a particular server you can go from cloud you can get it from
44:38
online services you can get it from other sources which says from web
44:43
from your hadoop file system from active directory from a blank query and you can
44:49
even combine queries wherein you can run a power query editor you can get the
44:56
data from different sources and then you can bring it into your excel so in this
45:01
way you can get your data from different sources into your excel
45:06
into your spreadsheet and then you can continue working on those data sets
45:13
we have already learned some basic operations which you can do in excel and let's
45:19
implement our knowledge by working on this particular data which is coming in
45:25
from housing data set now here if we see some fields we have
45:30
agent date listed area list price and this is basically the data which has been
45:36
sorted in newest to oldest order of date listed so how do we
45:43
arrive at this so what i can do is i can just click on data listed
45:49
and then i can either go in here i can select sort i can get
45:56
into custom sort and then i can choose the column
46:01
based on which i would want to sort the data so i would look for the newest data
46:06
to the oldest data that means that would be in a descending order of dates or you
46:12
could say the oldest date or the earliest month will be towards the lower
46:17
side of your sheet so here we can select date listed now i can say let it sort
46:24
based on cell values and the order what we have here so we have newest to oldest
46:30
so let's select this i can say okay and now if you see the date has been sorted
46:36
so we have your 10 18 2007 on the top so that seems to
46:42
be the latest date and as we go down we will see an earlier month hour and
46:49
earlier month than that in this date listed so we have sorted our data
46:55
into newest to oldest order and that's based on your date column so the result shows up here
47:03
now what we can also do is we can have different questions which we would want to answer so for example i would want to
47:10
sort the data in ascending order of area and descending order of agent name how
47:16
do we do that so let's look into this so this is here i already have the result
47:23
here and how did i get this so i am looking for ascending order of area in descending order of agent name so we can
47:31
start with any particular column that does not matter so for example if i look
47:36
into this excel sheet i have my agent name select this which we want in a
47:42
descending order so we could either do a sort and then go for
47:47
descending sort z to a we could also use the filter option here on the top right
47:54
and we could do it or i could just say sort z to a and then it
48:00
has arranged the data based on the agent column being in descending order now i can go into area
48:08
and then i can again do a sort and i wanted my area column
48:13
to be used for sorting the data ascending to descending and that basically not only changes the
48:20
order of this particular column but for my complete data so let's do that and now if you see we have the
48:28
data which has been sorted so we can see how many values we have here
48:34
and the area values which we see and this is how you get your result so i'll
48:39
just do a ctrl z and again and i'm back to my original data
48:45
and this is the sorted result which we are seeing at similarly we can answer other questions
48:51
for example sort the data according to the following order of area
48:57
that is we are saying county central and then your county so we can
49:04
basically choose in which particular way we would want to do it so it is county central and then
49:11
again county so if i look into my sheet 3 so here
49:16
i basically have my data which is having some south county then you have
49:21
your central and then you have your north county so we would want to
49:27
sort the data to solve our problem which is according to the following order so
49:33
first we go for area then we go for south county central and north county so
49:39
what we can do is we can basically have area field selected
49:45
and i would want to sort this particular data so i have south county central and
49:52
north county so i can basically go for custom sort and then i can choose which
49:59
is the value or column which i am interested in let's go for area we will go for something like
50:07
cell values well you can also try to explore conditional formatting icon if
50:13
this is what you would want to use or we can basically go for just cell
50:19
values and here we can say if i would be interested in first
50:25
getting my values for south county so for example i can say custom list
50:32
and then i can basically given the new list here so i can say s
50:39
dot county and then i would want central
50:44
and then i would want north county so let's select this
50:51
as it exists we can basically say add and that's basically the order which we
50:58
want to say okay and then say okay here and now what we would want is we would
51:05
want our data so we can compare that with the values which we see here it
51:10
starts with kelly you have in the 12th row something like lang and that's what we are doing so we
51:16
can basically arrange the data in a particular order by choosing a custom
51:22
list and then sorting your data so that's one more simpler task of what
51:28
we have done where we have sorted the data in the order where
51:34
under our area column we first wanted south county then we wanted central data and then we
51:41
wanted north county so this is how you can do it now
51:47
let's look into one more problems it says find all the houses in the central
51:52
area and we would want to basically apply a regular filter let's let's see how do we
51:58
do that so we can click on this and here we have the data so the problem
52:04
statement is we would want to find all the houses in central area now how do we
52:10
do that we can do a sorting but we would want to use the filter which you see here
52:16
is implemented so how do you do it so you can select this area and say for example i would want to
52:23
apply filter i can just go in here and i can say let's get a filter on my first
52:29
row and now i have filters applied so we are interested in looking into the
52:35
central area houses let's go in here it says all these fields are selected that means
52:41
it shows everything wherein your area has all these values let's unselect this and then i will only
52:49
be interested in the central so let's say okay and then say okay so now you see that
52:56
the area filter has been applied and we are looking at the central column so
53:02
what we have done is we have applied a simple filter and we are looking at our data at any point of time if you do not
53:10
want the filter then what i can do is i can select this
53:17
and i can say well i'm interested in all the data so i could do this or you can clear the
53:22
filters from area and you get your data back so that's in one way you can filter out
53:29
your data so let's look at an example of sort and filter where we might have to
53:35
filter the data based on two columns or multiple columns with different kind
53:40
of values where it could be and and or condition now say for example this is the data i have and this is the question
53:48
which we need to answer such as find the list of all houses in the central region with pool and
53:56
south county without pool now if it was a simple filter based on one cell i
54:02
could have just selected my header row i could have then applied the
54:09
filter and once i have the filter i can look in area where i have three regions so i'm
54:16
only interested in central and south county so i can get rid of north county and that's fine but then
54:23
we have two different conditions here so we need the data in central region to have
54:31
the value for pool being true and for south county the value has to be
54:37
without pool now how do we do that so what we can do is we can
54:42
first create a copy of these headers here so let me do that
54:49
now the area has to be south county so basically i can
54:55
either just select this and i can choose this value
55:01
and then i can select this and then i can choose central so that's the
55:07
criteria which i have and the pool value has to be so
55:12
central region should be with pool so then this one
55:17
basically has to be true and this one has to be basically false so
55:25
south county is without pool so let's select one of the values here and this is my criteria now
55:32
to get my result uh we can always place your cursor here and you can check this is m column and
55:40
eighth row okay so we would want the result here so let's go ahead and now click on data and
55:48
then in filter you have an option called advanced and here what i can do is i can
55:55
say i would want to filter the list in the place but that's not what i would want to do so i'll say copy to another
56:01
location and here if you see the list range will tell me that this is the data
56:07
so a1 to j126 so a to j column selected and all the rows
56:13
criteria range is basically based on what i have given here so that is m
56:20
from 1 to v which is 3 so i am selecting these columns and then
56:28
i am saying all the way whatever criteria i have given and copy 2 i am saying m8
56:35
to v8 so that basically will give me my filtered result so you could basically
56:42
just say okay and now i have my data which has been filtered
56:47
and i have my area which is south county that is without pool central with pool
56:55
again south county without pool and then if you look at your central value that's
57:01
pool so this is an advanced filter which we have applied where simply we have filtered the data based on two columns
57:08
and then we have our result so in this way you can have your customized filter
57:15
applied on two different columns and get your data which can be either
57:21
replacing the existing content or in the same sheet in different set of
57:26
columns and rows you can have your result let's look at one more example of filtering where you are trying to filter
57:34
the data based on an and condition condition being met in two different columns and then you would want to
57:42
filter out the data for only specific columns so the situation is the agents with a house
57:49
in north county that should be county area having two
57:54
and a single type family so we are talking about two bedrooms and
58:00
we would basically have a single type family and here the criteria is that we
58:05
would want to only populate these columns which is agent area bedroom and type now what you
58:13
can do is as i explained earlier that you can get your result in
58:18
the same sheet in a different location so here i have created these headers which says
58:25
agent area bedrooms and type now this is basically a copy of all the
58:31
columns what we have here agent data listed area list price bedrooms bath
58:37
square feet and so on so you can basically create a copy of the headers
58:42
here and this is where we will give our advanced criteria to filter the data
58:49
so the conditions which need to be met is we need to look at north county
58:54
so for example here in area i can basically go ahead and select one of the
58:59
values north county now the criteria is having two bedrooms
59:04
only so let's say bedrooms and let's say the value should be two
59:10
and then basically i am saying a single type family so when you would want the
59:16
single type family so here under type i can give the criteria
59:22
single type so this is my and condition so we are saying north county area having two
59:29
bedrooms and the type is single family now this is the criteria which basically
59:34
means if i select this this one tells me that this is m
59:39
one row onwards till v two so this is what we have and we would
59:46
want to filter based on this so let's go ahead and then go for data
59:51
filter advanced and here in advanced it says filter the list in place now that's not what we
59:58
would want to do so i'll say copy to another location this basically selects the list range so
1:00:04
which is telling me a1 to j126
1:00:09
so that's the columns and rows selected criteria range
1:00:14
is based on m1 v2 which we have given here and copy 2 i would say for example
1:00:21
from m7 to p7 now this is the area where i would
1:00:28
this is the place where i want the result let's say okay and now i get my data which is
1:00:34
based on the question which has been asked that you would want the agents with a house in north county area having
1:00:42
two bedrooms and single type family so in this way you can basically do advanced filtering
1:00:48
get your data and get it stored in the sheet anywhere at a different location
1:00:54
well i could have also done filtering in place and that would have replaced
1:00:59
the data which we have but that's not what we want we would want the filtered result
1:01:06
in a different place so this is how you can do some advanced filtering we can
1:01:11
also use excel to filter out the data in one particular column which might be
1:01:17
conditional or say using some numerical filters now here
1:01:22
say for example the problem statement is that you would want to display all the houses whose list price is between
1:01:31
45 000 to 600 000 or say for example we would want to
1:01:37
filter out the data to something else say for example let's say i have
1:01:43
i would want to filter out the data between 300 000 and 400 000
1:01:48
so we can basically update this say for example i am saying i am
1:01:55
interested in 300 000 to
1:02:02
400 000 and that's the criteria to filter out the data now there are two different
1:02:08
ways so there are two easier ways to do it one is i would want to
1:02:14
look at the list price so i can select this i can go ahead and do a filter here
1:02:21
and in the list price now this is where we would want to do the filtering so it's pretty easy you can click on this
1:02:28
one and then you can go into number filters and you can choose between now that's one easier way of doing it so i
1:02:35
could basically select this i could say i'm looking for value which is greater
1:02:40
than or equal to 300 000 and then is less than or equal to 400
1:02:48
000 so if i just do this i have applied my filter and i have my
1:02:55
data which is filtered based on my criteria right so that's one easier way of doing it or let me do a control
1:03:03
z now let the filter be there which you can anyways use but what we can also do is
1:03:11
as we have seen earlier methods so get a set or get your column headers here
1:03:19
and then you are giving two columns here now the only difference between
1:03:26
my this set of columns which i have 1 2 3 4
1:03:31
and then you have 7 and 10 columns and if you see here we have 4
1:03:38
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 right so whenever you want
1:03:43
a and condition you will basically add the columns where i can give add
1:03:49
condition if it is the same column if it was a different column then it would be
1:03:54
same number of columns but and conditions will lie in the same line and all condition would lie in a different
1:04:01
line now here i can give this value so i am looking for listed price
1:04:07
being between 300 000 so i am saying it should be greater than or equal to
1:04:14
300 000 and then i can say less than or equal to
1:04:20
400 000 now that's my criteria and then i need my result here which is
1:04:27
in m7 so what i can do is once i have given my criteria which i'll be using
1:04:34
to filter i can get into data i can get into advanced
1:04:39
and then i can say copy to another location so it is selecting my a1 to
1:04:44
j126 criteria range is based on m1 to w
1:04:50
2 and then i would want my result from this particular column so let's say okay and now you have your
1:04:57
data filtered out in a different location in the sheet which has been filtered based on your
1:05:04
and condition so you can filter out the data in this way or you could just apply
1:05:09
a filter on a column and give the conditions now let's solve one more interesting
1:05:15
problem and here we would want to use excel where we would have an and and an
1:05:22
or condition so say for example this is the data given to you and the question is that you would want to find all the
1:05:29
houses in north county again that's a spelling mistake but then the
1:05:35
north county area with a list price greater than 300 000
1:05:40
and having three or four bedrooms so the bedroom has conditional so it has or three and
1:05:48
four and then basically you have list price which is greater than 300 000
1:05:53
now i could have obviously selected the columns and then basically
1:05:59
gone for a filter so i can just do a filtering here
1:06:04
and then i'm looking for list price being greater than 300 000 so which we can always give a number filter and i
1:06:12
can say greater than and then i can say greater than or equal so i can say
1:06:19
greater than and then i can give three thousand thirty three hundred thousand and that's basically the filter which we
1:06:26
would want and here i would want to select the bedrooms
1:06:32
which should be just either three or four so if for example here i go in here
1:06:39
and i unselect this and then i say three and four right so i am getting my data which is
1:06:46
greater than 300 000 and it should have the bettering values which will be
1:06:51
either three or four selected now that's one way of doing it let's do a control z
1:06:57
and get it back to as we were or you can even just say
1:07:02
clear filter so you get your data back as it was so what we can do is we can
1:07:08
here give the criteria so for example i have my
1:07:14
list price now this is what i would want as a condition so let's say greater than
1:07:22
300 000 300
1:07:27
and bedrooms should be three and then i can say greater than three
1:07:34
hundred thousand and then i can say four so this one basically gives me a
1:07:41
situation where your list price has to be greater than 300 000 and bedroom should be either three or four so we
1:07:48
have given our filtering criteria now to get the result what we can do is
1:07:53
we can go into data we can go into advanced and we can say copy to another location
1:07:59
so our list range is selected which is columns a to j row number 1 to 126
1:08:07
your criteria range is given in m1 to v3 where we have specified and we are
1:08:13
saying the result would be in m7 to v7 so if i do this now i have got the same
1:08:19
data which we were seeing earlier and here the bedroom values are 3 or 4
1:08:24
and basically the list price is greater than 300 000 so this is a simpler way in
1:08:30
which you can create your filters and all this advanced filtering what we are seeing it will be saved with your sheet
1:08:39
you can always go back and change this value or you could do filtering where one person
1:08:46
has to look into the filter to see what values have been selected
1:08:52
now that we have looked into some operations which we can perform in
1:08:58
excel using filter or sorting the data creating your tables let's also quickly
1:09:04
look at functions and formulas which can be used for doing some easy calculations or
1:09:11
computations now excel can be used in different kind of data analysis so for example you have
1:09:18
different inbuilt functions which can be used and we can always check for a particular
1:09:25
function so for example if i had if i wanted to look at a particular function i could just
1:09:32
type in here something for example is and then it shows me all the possible functions and
1:09:40
you can always have a look at the detail of the function for example you have is even which will return true if the
1:09:47
number is even if we would say is logical so i could search for
1:09:54
is logical and that tells me whether a value is logical value true or false and
1:09:59
returns your value true and false now we can obviously
1:10:05
say subtotal so you can search for any of these useful functions and that tells
1:10:11
me what this function can be used for so returns a subtotal in a list or a
1:10:16
database you have many other such functions such as integer sum
1:10:22
average you may be interested in working on truncating
1:10:27
some data getting the absolute value getting the square root basically getting a count or getting a
1:10:35
max value you can look for any particular functions within your excel sheet
1:10:40
now you also have other functions such as now or time for example let's look at now
1:10:47
function so i can search for now
1:10:53
and here it is so this is returns the current date and time formatted as a date and time so
1:11:00
this is the function which we would want to use and if i just give the function it tells
1:11:07
me what is the current time let's first look at the description of time here so
1:11:13
say for example i would want time it says converts hours minutes and seconds
1:11:19
given as numbers to an excel serial number formatted with a time format so
1:11:24
for example if i would say 2 hours and then
1:11:30
30 minutes and 30 seconds and if i do this it has
1:11:35
basically converted this into your time format so you can always use different
1:11:41
inbuilt functions for your work now we will also look at some advanced functions like sum f or sum ifs
1:11:48
you have count f and count f's and you can be working on various
1:11:54
functionalities of excel to easily help you in doing some
1:11:59
calculations computations working with your data working with your different
1:12:05
cell values so let's look at some example of using functions like sum or
1:12:11
sum if so for that let's go to this sheet and here we have
1:12:18
some data now i have already applied a filter which can allow me to filter out
1:12:23
the data so it says find the total units that were sold in the east region now we
1:12:30
know that in region we have east and i have multiple regions i could
1:12:38
basically be saying unselect all and select only east
1:12:44
and say ok and that basically gives me the units which were sold and if i place my cursor
1:12:51
here and then if i did a auto sum so it would basically give me
1:12:58
the function which is being used so something like subtotal and it is basically working on
1:13:05
your rows which is e2 to e44 and here
1:13:11
we can just do this so that gives me the total but this is this is
1:13:17
fine you could do that but it would be good if we know how do we
1:13:22
use a function like sum if to do that so here i'm seeing this is the subtotal
1:13:29
where i'm looking at the values and basically what i have done is i have
1:13:35
filtered out the region and then basically i am getting a count but
1:13:41
this does not give me clearly how a sum was calculated from all the values
1:13:47
which were listed what we can also do is let's do a control z and let's get it
1:13:52
back so now we have our data and we would want to get the total units that were
1:13:58
sold in the east region so what i can do is i can start typing in my formula
1:14:04
and for that i'll use a inbuilt function so for example i would be interested in going for sumif now it says sumif adds
1:14:11
the cells specified by a given condition or criteria when you talk about some ifs
1:14:18
this is when you could give set of conditions or multiple criteria so let's
1:14:23
look at some if let's do this now obviously this gives me an error because the formula
1:14:30
is not right so we have to basically come in here and let's start with sum
1:14:37
if now when i say sum if it shows me there is a function with
1:14:42
sumif which we would want to use and here once i open up the bracket it tells me
1:14:48
okay what is the range of data which you are interested in so i am interested in
1:14:55
all the units that were sold in the east region so we are interested in the region
1:15:01
which is here so i can basically be selecting this
1:15:07
and this tells me you are interested in the data here so let's not take the header value so let's
1:15:15
say b2 and then we can go all the way to the end so we can
1:15:20
basically select this way that's the data we have select this and
1:15:28
hit enter so now here it has selected b2 to b4 but we need to
1:15:36
basically now give the criteria so the criteria is either a value or you can
1:15:43
point it to a cell which has that particular value so as per our problem statement we are looking
1:15:49
for the units which are sold in east region so i can select the value east here
1:15:54
and then my sum if needs the range on which you want to
1:16:01
calculate a sum so let's select this and now we are
1:16:06
interested in finding out the sum of units so that's basically this column e
1:16:12
column so i can basically type in instead of selecting so i can say e
1:16:17
and i'm interested in e2 2 e 44 so that basically selects the area
1:16:25
or all the values and now let's do this so that basically gives me the sum is
1:16:31
691 right now this is the criteria where i have pointed it to a cell and whatever
1:16:38
value that cell has well i could have done something like this so i could have
1:16:44
selected east giving the value and then doing it it still does the same
1:16:49
thing and in this way you have more clarity that you are using sumif you are
1:16:55
filtering the data so you have given the rows you are given the criteria and then you
1:17:02
have given the range on which you would want to sum up the values
1:17:07
now similarly if the question was what was the total revenue generated from binder
1:17:13
now we would want to find out what is the total revenue generated from binders
1:17:18
that means my filtering criteria will be binder
1:17:24
and then i want to find out the total revenue generated so we have the revenue
1:17:31
generated field also here and we have we don't have any region to
1:17:36
be filtered we are just looking for binder so let's again start doing the
1:17:42
same thing so we can go for some if we can open the bracket now it needs the
1:17:47
range so we are interested in revenue generated now that's the
1:17:53
summation we want and we would want to get the range of data so here
1:18:01
we can basically select uh d
1:18:06
2 2 d 44 so that's the data selected now i would
1:18:14
want to give the filtering criteria so let's say binder and then we need to give the range on
1:18:20
which the sum needs to be calculated so that's my revenue column so that's g
1:18:26
so i can say g 2 to g 44
1:18:32
and that basically selects the column and then you get your sum so it tells me what is the total revenue generated from
1:18:40
binder now i could be doing this for other things also so
1:18:46
say for example if you would want to filter out something else you could basically just drag and drop
1:18:52
here and then i could come here and change this to say
1:18:57
instead of binder i would be interested in say pencil
1:19:05
if that's the criteria you're interested in remember to change this so that you take
1:19:11
all the values and here we will change
1:19:18
it to select the relevant rows and then this is the data i'm getting so i know
1:19:25
that this is the revenue generated from pencil this is the revenue
1:19:30
generated from binder now this is a simple use case where we are using some if what if we would want to use some ifs
1:19:40
so some ifs let's have a look at how we get to some ifs
1:19:46
so some if says where you would want to work on
1:19:52
doing some calculation but then you would want
1:19:58
multiple criterias to be met so let's see how we get this so here what i can do is
1:20:06
let's work on this problem statement which says what is the total revenue generated from central region
1:20:14
where the item is a pencil so that's
1:20:19
something which i would want to check now when we are answering this question we can also look at the order in which
1:20:27
things have been asked in the question so it says what is the total revenue generated from central region so we need
1:20:35
the total revenue generated we know there is a revenue column we are interested in getting the total revenue
1:20:41
generated we are saying the filtering criteria is central region
1:20:47
and we say in that we would be interested only in the item if it is pencil how do i do it so i can
1:20:55
use sumifs where you can pass in multiple criteria so let's start with
1:21:00
some ifs and when i start with some ifs let's
1:21:05
open up the bracket so it says sum range it says criteria range then it gives one
1:21:11
criteria and you can give in any number of criterias so for example we are interested in total revenue generated
1:21:19
now that's my g column so let's follow in the same order so let's say g
1:21:24
2 so that's my first value and then i know there are 44 rows here so i can say g
1:21:31
44 and you can obviously check if that has selected all the rows
1:21:38
now that's my total revenue generated so i would want the total revenue
1:21:44
generated so i'm saying setting this sum range then
1:21:49
i need to give the criteria range so it says from central region so central
1:21:55
region comes into column 2 that's b so let's say b
1:22:01
2 to b 44 so that's my criteria range
1:22:06
then you have to give your criteria but we need to filter out the region being
1:22:13
central so let's select this now either i could point to a value in the cell or
1:22:20
i can just give the exact value here we can also give a
1:22:26
wild card or matching pattern so that also works now this one is fine
1:22:32
we are now also interested in finding the total revenue generated when the
1:22:38
region is central and the item is pencil how do we do that so for
1:22:44
item we know the columns the column is d2 so let's select d2
1:22:51
2 d 44 so that basically selects
1:22:56
all the rows in the d column and we need to give the filtering criteria so let's do a comma
1:23:04
and then just given our value so let's say pencil and then let's close your bracket and
1:23:11
that basically gives you the result so we need to just follow the order of our
1:23:18
question which says what is the total revenue generated so we are looking at the revenue column we are selecting all
1:23:25
the rows then it says from the central region so we need to
1:23:30
select the region column and give the filtering criteria central or point to a
1:23:36
cell which contains that value and then it says we would be interested only in item
1:23:42
being pencil so then you select the column which has all the items and provide your filtering
1:23:50
criteria that is pencil so that's your easy calculation of using
1:23:55
sum if which we compare with sum if here so sum if here was
1:24:01
just having your criteria
1:24:06
so basically you are selecting your rows giving your filtering criteria and then your sum range in some ifs we are giving
1:24:14
multiple condition now same thing can be done here it says how many units were sold by sales representative john's
1:24:22
or jones where the cost of each item was greater than four so how many units were sold
1:24:30
by sales representative so when we talk about how many units
1:24:36
that's your e column so let's start with that so let's say some ifs
1:24:42
i would be interested in e column then let's give the range
1:24:49
so it says sum range so those are the number of units on which we would want
1:24:54
to find the sum then it says you need to give the criteria range so we say sales
1:25:01
representative where the name is jones so sales representative is in sales rep
1:25:08
column c so let's say c2 to c44
1:25:14
now then we need to give our filtering criteria so let's say jones
1:25:20
is the sales representative where we are interested about whom we are interested in
1:25:25
and then we the question says where the cost of each item
1:25:31
so cost of each item is what we are interested in you have unit cost
1:25:37
so that's what we are interested in so that would be f and then say f2 to f44
1:25:44
and then you need to give your cost so it says where each item
1:25:52
is greater than 4 so let's select this
1:25:58
and let's do this so this tells me 3 0 1
1:26:05
now similarly let's answer our third question which says how many units did
1:26:12
jones sell excluding pencil item so we would want to find out
1:26:18
what was the total number of units units that were sold
1:26:23
and that units or that should not include the pencil item how do we start doing this
1:26:31
so let's start with some ifs now we know that you start with some ifs
1:26:37
you need to give the sum range so we are interested in the number of units so let's basically go in and select
1:26:45
our number of units which were sold so that's your column e
1:26:51
so i can say e2 to e44 that's where i would want to perform this sum
1:26:58
now i'm saying how many units that were sold where
1:27:05
we are talking about sales rep being jones so let's see let's select the columns
1:27:12
c and then give the range after that we need to give our giving
1:27:19
filtering criteria which is jones and then we are interested in the items but excluding pencil so items
1:27:29
is in column d so let's say d to d 44
1:27:34
and then we have to give our criteria so we can say well that should
1:27:42
exclude pencil so i can basically say
1:27:47
pencil and let's close this
1:27:53
and let's check so that's my formula which says that these are the number of units which
1:28:00
the sales representative whose name is jones had sold and that does not include pencil as an
1:28:08
item let's also look at an example of using countif or countifs now both of
1:28:15
these can be very useful when you would want to calculate certain values so for example if i would want to work
1:28:22
on count f let's try solving this problem now remember you can answer these
1:28:28
questions using filters and that can be an easier way but then sometimes you may
1:28:33
want to get the formulas so that you can make your spreadsheet and your calculation
1:28:40
more dynamic in nature and that will basically depend on the values in the
1:28:46
columns or rows so for example if i have find the total number of times
1:28:52
gil has made a sale now if i look at my data here it tells me that for every
1:28:58
sales representative there is some value in the sale and it says sales has
1:29:04
greater than three so for example jones you have sales greater than 3
1:29:10
or you have jardine which is sales greater than 3 and so on so what we are
1:29:16
interested in is doing a quick count in finding out the total number of times gill has made a
1:29:24
sale how do we do that so we can use this count if function and if i go into
1:29:30
countif it says counts the number of cells within a range that meet the given
1:29:36
condition now what's our condition our condition is kill and we would want
1:29:41
to find out how many times the name say gill appears or kill has made a sale now
1:29:48
i could just say count if and then open up a bracket i need to give a range so let's say
1:29:56
we are interested in looking at the range so let's say we will choose
1:30:03
sales rep so i can say c and then i can say c2
1:30:08
to c44 now that's my
1:30:14
range let's not give that in quotes
1:30:19
so you have to give a range so let's do a count if that selects the data and
1:30:25
then we need to give the condition so for example let's here give the name
1:30:30
which is gil and then close this so that basically tells me
1:30:36
it is five times kill appears here we can check this so i can go in here i can
1:30:42
add a filter and then might be i would be interested interested in looking at only gil
1:30:50
and that basically gives me 5 right so we can always do that and we
1:30:56
can be using formulas like this now what about this question so which basically
1:31:01
says which sales representative made a sale more than three times now we it
1:31:07
might be looking a little confusing when i say for example let me clear out this
1:31:13
filter now we have sales greater than three and
1:31:18
we would want to find out which sales representative made a sale more than
1:31:23
three times now i could basically check for every
1:31:29
sales representative here if they have made a sale more than three times and what i can do is i can
1:31:36
just say equals i can start with count if then i need
1:31:42
my filtering criteria so that's your range so first thing is we will choose for
1:31:48
example let's choose c2 to c 44
1:31:53
and then we need to give and criteria what is the criteria
1:32:00
we need basically a sales representative so i can choose the value here
1:32:05
in c2 and then i can close this and then i can say the
1:32:11
sale has to be greater than three and let's check so it tells me the
1:32:16
boolean value that yes this guy has made sales more than three times and what we
1:32:24
can do is we can just drag and drop which basically gives me the value for other sales rep you can
1:32:32
always check the value is automatically changing to this value in cell and for example let's go in here so this
1:32:39
is obviously two so it says me false right and you can basically get the
1:32:45
values for all your values so that basically tells me which
1:32:51
sales representative has made a sale more than three times
1:32:56
now like some ifs we also have countifs where you can give multiple criterias so
1:33:02
for example the question is how many orders were placed from the east region
1:33:08
after this particular date so we have a date criteria we also have the region
1:33:16
criteria and we need to basically get the count of number of orders which
1:33:21
were placed now i can in this case use count
1:33:27
ifs and this basically says that you can
1:33:32
start within criteria so it says how many orders were placed from east region
1:33:38
after particular date so date is in my
1:33:44
first column so for example i could say a start with 2
1:33:50
and say for example let's go a 44 that should have selected all the rows
1:33:57
and then i need to once i've given the criteria range i need to give the criteria so we are
1:34:04
saying the date has to be greater than 10th feb
1:34:10
so let's give it 2 10 2019
1:34:18
and then you need to say how many orders were placed so you need to give the criteria second criteria
1:34:25
range so we are looking at the number of orders which were
1:34:30
placed from the east region so when i would want to look at the
1:34:36
region that's your column b so i can basically say b2 to b 44
1:34:44
and here i would basically
1:34:50
give my criteria so the criteria is east
1:34:55
let's give that and once you have done this you would want to find out the total number of
1:35:02
orders so let's select this and if i do this it tells me 13.
1:35:07
now is that right so we are looking for your date
1:35:14
your region being east and then getting the total number of orders so here
1:35:19
i can just do a count if i'm saying a2
1:35:24
to a44 wherein i have given the date criteria that it should be greater than
1:35:32
10th feb because i do not want to count 10 feb it says after 10 february
1:35:37
and then you are saying the region has to be east so we would want to find out
1:35:43
the total number of orders so my region is east and that gives me the result
1:35:49
now similarly you can also find out how many times gil sold pencils so
1:35:56
here we will have to give the range so let's start with count
1:36:04
ifs now here i would want that item is pencils so we can as well
1:36:11
select column d to d 44
1:36:19
then you have to give your criteria so that's your
1:36:25
pencil and then we are looking for sales rep which is
1:36:31
kill so that is my column c so let's say c 2
1:36:38
2 c 44 and the value should be
1:36:44
just kill
1:36:49
so it tells me it's twice where gil has sold pencils so we can obviously check
1:36:58
this by going in here choosing my filter
1:37:03
and then let's search for rep being just gill
1:37:10
okay and now we are interested only in the item being pencil
1:37:15
so i can say well let's get to pencil only and that tells me twice
1:37:21
so you can obviously re-verify using filters but using functions or using
1:37:27
formulas it is always good to calculate and that
1:37:32
can be making your computation and calculation more dynamic
1:37:38
let's look at one more interesting feature of excel and that's your conditional formatting now as you see on
1:37:45
the screen conditional formatting has different rules which can be applied on your data
1:37:51
and that allows you to basically differentiate or easily identify data
1:37:57
values which are based on certain criterias or rules so
Conditional formating in excel data analysis
1:38:04
when you talk about conditional formatting you have different options such as you can highlight cell rules you
1:38:11
can get top and bottom values you can apply different rules apply different
1:38:17
color scales and you you can easily manage these rules
1:38:22
so conditional formatting is very useful for people who would want to work on huge amount of data and easily perform
1:38:30
some data analysis it's easy to use as it is shown here and
1:38:36
with your conditional formatting you can format cells based on a preset condition
1:38:42
you can perform conditional formatting to identify cells
1:38:47
you can highlight a few significant cells and you can easily perform conditional formatting
1:38:54
as shown on the left side now how do we work with conditional
1:38:59
formatting let's have a quick look so say for example we have our excel
1:39:04
sheet and if you see here i am highlighting the sales person who have generated
1:39:11
revenue greater than 10 000 so we can be looking at the values where
1:39:17
the revenue generated by a particular sales person is greater than 10 000 it
1:39:23
has a particular color and how do we get here so for
1:39:28
example let's select this data and what i could do is
1:39:35
i could go into conditional formatting now i could basically highlight cell
1:39:40
rules and we could just say greater than that's an easier way i could also go ahead and create a new
1:39:48
rule but then i can use one of this option i can say greater than and let's give some value might be we
1:39:55
would be interested in looking at any value greater than twelve thousand
1:40:00
so let's choose twelve thousand
1:40:05
and here it says what color would you want to select so for example
1:40:11
i would say something like yellow filled with dark yellow text
1:40:20
and let's say okay so right now what i'm doing is i have all the values where the revenue
1:40:26
generator was greater than 10 000 but then i have also selected all the
1:40:32
sales people who have made or who have generated revenue greater than twelve
1:40:38
thousand so i can just wait ctrl z to see the previous result now here
1:40:44
i had the values which were greater than ten thousand and the one which we did just now
1:40:50
basically highlighted the values which are greater than 12 000. so this is one simple
1:40:57
example now we can look at some other examples say for example you want to format cells using three color scale so
1:41:04
if you look at the values here i have a three color scale mainly in green yellow
1:41:10
and red and how do you do this so for example i can go in here
1:41:16
and i can go to conditional formatting so i would want to go for color scales and here
1:41:23
you can create different rules so we can set up a two color scale so we
1:41:29
can say format only values that are above and below average i can format only cells that
1:41:36
contain something i can get the top and bottom values so these are different ways in which
1:41:42
i can have a three color based scale now what
1:41:47
i will do is i will select this and let me show you the rule which i
1:41:53
have so for example i can go into manage rules and if you see here there are certain rules which
1:41:59
have been specified now what does that mean so you would want to specify a
1:42:05
three grade scale so for example if i would want to look at my first rule
1:42:11
it tells me that i am choosing three color scale i can choose lowest value percentile and highest value and that
1:42:18
basically will select the cells based on their values
1:42:24
so what we could have done is i can basically use one of these values i can delete
1:42:32
these rules which i have created so for example i have all these rules
1:42:39
but you should always carefully remember that the rules will be applied in the order shown so for example if i just
1:42:47
delete these rules and then say apply and say okay my data
1:42:53
is back now it does not have any highlighting now i can go in here
1:42:58
i can say condition sorry conditional formatting i could go for color scale so i could
1:43:05
basically go into new rule so i would want
1:43:11
the cells to be using three color scale so let's
1:43:17
choose three color scale now when you say three color scale it says what will
1:43:22
be the color of lowest value and we could choose might be any one of
1:43:28
this let's choose red i can say midpoint is percentile 50
1:43:33
and then the highest value is green and if that looks good let's say okay and
1:43:39
now if you see the lowest values have been highlighted as red you have mid values and then you have
1:43:47
the positive value so this is the three color scale and that easily helps me in identifying the data
1:43:53
based on the cell values now in conditional formatting what you
1:43:58
can also do is you can basically color the cells based on their
1:44:05
value so what we are seeing here is if the revenue generated
1:44:11
is greater than average then that shows in green and if the revenue generated is lesser
1:44:18
than average that's shows in orange now how do we do that so we can
1:44:24
basically again manage some rules so i can basically create a new rule
1:44:29
now here i can select one of the options which says format only values that are
1:44:35
above or below average and that's the option i would want to select now i can select this and it says format values
1:44:43
that are above average so in our case we had it in green so for
1:44:48
example i'll say above average and then here i can go for
1:44:55
a particular color so you can go for a particular size
1:45:00
so let's go and look into the formatting so for example let's choose yellow
1:45:10
say okay now i'm saying wherever the cell values are above average it
1:45:16
would be yellow instead of green and let's go in here
1:45:22
let's go and look into manage rules so this is basically the rule which we are applying
1:45:28
now we can also add a new rule and i need to
1:45:33
select the values so for example i will say
1:45:40
here so we had gone for above now we will go for below we'll go for format we will choose red
1:45:48
we'll say okay we'll say now these are basically
1:45:54
the rules which we have created and here it says applies to your data so right
1:46:00
now it has not been applied so for example if i select this and then
1:46:06
i could basically choose my area just hit on enter and
1:46:12
similarly you can go in here and then select your area
1:46:17
hit on enter and say apply say okay and now if you see
1:46:23
i have really chosen bright colors but then i have said wherever my revenue
1:46:28
generated is above average it should be in yellow and
1:46:35
below average should be in red so we wanted above average to be in green
1:46:42
and below average to be in orange so that's what we have here right so you
1:46:48
can always color code your cell values based on some rules which you are setting up now
1:46:55
similarly you can also find the top 10 and bottom 10 values and
1:47:01
that's pretty easy so you can just select this and then you can go into conditional
1:47:07
formatting you can go for top and bottom values top 10 items bottom 10 items
1:47:13
or you can go in for more rules so you can say format only top or bottom ranked
1:47:20
values so you have top 10 now you can choose the color
1:47:26
and for example i'll go for blue
1:47:32
and i'll say okay so now if you see my top 10 values are
1:47:38
blue now similarly i can add one more rule so i can say new rule and i can say
1:47:44
let's go for top or bottom let's go for bottom let's go for format
1:47:51
let's say orange say okay say okay and that's it so now you have
1:47:57
your values which are top or bottom 10 values so you are using conditional formatting
1:48:04
where you are basically highlighting your cell values based on different colors
1:48:10
and here easy conditional formatting based on different rules helps us to do that now
1:48:16
similarly you can also have the values
1:48:21
which is basically showing you how the values are increasing
1:48:28
so what we can do is we can select our columns
1:48:33
either you could apply this to all the columns now here i have applied this only to jan and april now i could apply
1:48:41
this for june so let's say june so you can go for gradient fill you can go for
1:48:47
solid fill you can obviously just select the color and that takes care of the things
1:48:54
you can say for example select this and now this is selected but i would want to might be format this so i can go in here
1:49:02
i can go into manage rules now that will tell me what rule has been applied
1:49:09
in the order so i can just do a edit rule and that basically says this is a
1:49:14
solid fill which is color you have no border this is basically color is black now i can go
1:49:22
for something like gradient fill and i can say okay and now if i say
1:49:28
apply and okay so this basically is like your first column so you can use conditional
1:49:35
formatting for various use cases and you can highlight the values so anyone who would look at the value
1:49:42
would automatically notice which are the higher values which are lower values might be
1:49:47
here the revenue is getting generated or was getting generated but did not grow
1:49:53
beyond a particular value and so on now similarly you can also go in for
1:50:00
different options say for example here we would want to
1:50:05
see if the revenue was dropping or if the revenue was
1:50:12
if the revenue decreased or say for example if the revenue was going up for this particular sales
1:50:19
person so here we are looking at carol so in jan the revenue generation by
1:50:24
sales was very high then in feb it was falling down
1:50:30
in march it was kind of stable then in april it went way below so we
1:50:37
can obviously work on this wherein we can grade our cell values so
1:50:44
what we can do is we can go in for highlighting the cell values now
1:50:51
you can go for color scales you can go for icon sets and this is where you can
1:50:57
choose your different shapes so you could choose one of these shapes
1:51:02
so for example i would be interested in looking at the indicators like directional
1:51:08
i could go using this three arrows i can go in for this color i can choose directional
1:51:16
and then my values are automatically
1:51:21
using directional now what we can also do is we can then go into manage rules
1:51:28
and that basically tells me what rules have been applied so for example the latest one is the
1:51:34
icon set which i have chosen it shows the selected columns i can obviously do
1:51:40
a edit rule and then i can choose so i'm saying the format style is
1:51:45
icon sets i'm not using a data bar i'm not using color scale
1:51:51
now here i have chosen the style of icons and then here
1:51:57
you can basically give some values so you have icon which is green when the value is greater than or equal
1:52:04
to 67 percentage when i say
1:52:10
hyphen or minus it is less than 67. it's way below 33 percentage
1:52:17
then you give this value so you can obviously edit and easily
1:52:22
highlight your cell values based on this icon set so i can apply this and that's
1:52:29
how i use conditional formatting so conditional formatting can be very useful if you would want to use icon set if you
1:52:37
want to use your data bars if you would want to highlight particular values
1:52:43
if you would want to color code based on some calculation if you would want to
1:52:50
use a three color or a two color scale or if you would want to just find out values based on some simple calculation
1:52:59
so conditional formatting is used extensively by data analysts
1:53:05
or people who are working business intelligence teams or people who would want to use excel to easily identify the
1:53:12
data easily identify the cells which contain particular value
1:53:17
or finding out less significant or more significant cells to then pull out values and carry out
1:53:25
your computations calculations or analysis let's continue learning on using excel
1:53:33
for various things now we have learnt on conditional formatting and seen how that
1:53:38
can be very helpful let's learn one more feature of excel and that's basically your data
1:53:44
validation now this can be very useful when you would want to work on
1:53:50
validating the data which is being fed in the cells so you could limit it to
1:53:56
basically a number between a particular value you could also add some messages
1:54:02
to it if you would want or you could even
1:54:07
circle invalid data or clear validation circles so data validation really helps
1:54:13
us in validating the data which is being fed in to particular fields
1:54:20
now it's a feature in excel which is mainly used to control what a user can
1:54:25
fill in a cell you can decide what type of values must be entered you can also
Data validation in excel data analysis
1:54:32
restrict user to enter only valid data and if any invalid data is entered an
1:54:38
error message will be displayed now that's where you can use your data validations so let's see how that can be
1:54:45
done so for data validation let's see some exercises here so for example you have a name column
1:54:53
and you would want to restrict that the name should accept only 15 characters now how do you do that so you
1:55:01
can basically select the cells or you can just select a particular cell
1:55:07
and then we can later drag the property to other fields now here
1:55:13
once the cell is selected so for example let's try this out and let's see if that
1:55:18
works so for example i will say peter johnson
1:55:25
okay and that is basically five and nine
1:55:31
and 12 characters so let's say
1:55:37
junior and if i do this it says input length is greater than 15 do you
1:55:43
want to continue if i say yes right so basically
1:55:48
it is allowing me to add the value here but then it has
1:55:54
basically violated the rule now this is giving a message to the user
1:56:00
that the username should be entered less than 15 characters now how do we do that
1:56:06
so for this we can basically select the column and then we can search
1:56:11
for data tab and get into data validation so this is where you can create or
1:56:17
select different kind of rules so for example i can go into data validation
1:56:23
i can go into settings and i can say the text length and that should be less than
1:56:30
15 now this is the maximum i'm giving and it says apply these changes to all other cells within the same settings
1:56:37
so i can do this or i can just drag and drop so i can basically
1:56:44
apply this formula and now you can in fact randomly check in any particular cell
1:56:50
is the rule applied so it says text length less than 15. so we can basically
1:56:55
control data validation in this particular column and that will allow
1:57:00
only 15 characters it will pop up a message if the user really wants to go beyond
1:57:07
the particular limit now you also have similarly date of birth
1:57:12
so the restriction is date of birth should be between 10 jan 1990 to 30
1:57:19
december 1998. so this is what we want to restrict how do we do that so we can select the field
1:57:27
we can click on data validation and if you see here i have selected date
1:57:32
and then date is between and then obviously you can give a range
1:57:37
that is 10 jan date 1990 12 30 1998 so that's the start and the
1:57:45
end filter which has been applied and once this is done you can also check
1:57:50
your input messages which says when cell is selected show this input
1:57:56
message enter a valid date so if you see here on the left there is
1:58:02
a pop-up which is coming up it says enter a valid date now i can also say
1:58:08
when user enters invalid data show this error alert so i can say stop
1:58:14
i can say invalid entered and this is how i have set a rule so for
1:58:20
example if i just do something like this and that says invalidate entered i can
1:58:27
do a retry it will take me back here but unless and until i did not
1:58:33
give the right format the date will not be accepted and again the same thing
1:58:39
applies to all the cells similarly email so we are saying the email should have at the rate present in
1:58:46
the value provided now for this we can use a formula and we can select well i
1:58:52
would want to apply this rule to all these rows starting from c2 to c14
1:59:00
so let's get into data validation let's look in settings and here we are
1:59:06
choosing custom now within custom i am choosing what is the formula so i am saying is
1:59:13
number and then i am saying find
1:59:18
at the rate for the rows c2 to c14 so the only thing we
1:59:24
are concerned about here is the value should have an email icon
1:59:31
you can input a particular message you can say what has to be done for
1:59:37
error alert so for example we can basically go in here and we can say
1:59:48
invalid email that's the title i'm giving and we can
1:59:54
say email should contain
2:00:00
at the rate so if i do this and if i say ok now you can test it so you can say a b c d and
2:00:08
that says email should contain at the rate and basically that will not allow
2:00:13
me to add the values so now you have the field called salary it says salary should be greater than 50
2:00:20
000 now we can limit the values by choosing a whole number so for example for salary
2:00:28
i can go into data validation i can go into settings so here i can say
2:00:35
something like decimal or i can go for whole number so
2:00:40
both of the things are fine it depends on what kind of values get into this particular field so if i say whole
2:00:46
number and if i say it has to be greater than 50 000 so i'm saying the minimum is 50 000
2:00:54
or i could have given a decimal and then i can say greater than less than equal
2:01:01
or anything or even between so i can select greater than and then i can just say okay
2:01:07
now for rank the rule is rank should be between 100 and 200 so again we can use
2:01:14
a whole number so ranks will generally not be decimal so this would be whole number salary
2:01:21
is can be a whole number or it could be decimals so we have chosen decimal here
2:01:27
and in rank if you click on data validation i have chosen whole number
2:01:34
i've set data between 100 and 200 input message nothing error alert
2:01:39
nothing but that depends i can give this so this is how you can just do a simple
2:01:45
data validation and control the values which land in the cell okay so now let's
2:01:52
also understand how we can restrict the values in a particular cell
2:01:58
which might be based on a list of items now for example here if you see i have
2:02:06
two columns so one column basically has the values of city
2:02:11
names and then you have places within that particular city so if i would want
2:02:16
to implement a data validation based on this so for example if you see here city
2:02:23
and that basically shows me only the four values which can be entered and if i go to place then it
2:02:30
tells me for maharashtra i can only enter pune mumbai nasik now how do i do
2:02:36
this so say for example you take an empty field and you want to restrict the values of city names so i could
2:02:44
select data validation i could basically select list and then it tells me you need to enter
2:02:51
the list values that is the source so you click here and then i can just select these fields now if i do this and
2:02:58
if i say ok it has implemented a data validation but if you look into this
2:03:04
it will show me the same thing but then it shows me some empty cells
2:03:10
which did not have any value so this is fine but it would be better if we
2:03:16
do it in a different way so i can select this and i have already given my city names here so i can just do a data
2:03:23
validation and here in the source let me get rid of
2:03:28
this now i can just have my cursor here
2:03:34
i can select these values and then if i say okay so now if you see my city names
2:03:40
have been restricted to these values and that's how you can implement your data
2:03:46
validation so i have this data validation here but i will get
2:03:51
rid of this one by just doing a control z now i'll come here and say for example i would want to
2:03:58
implement the same data validation now the easiest way would be in
2:04:04
doing this for all my four cities now if you see here i have
2:04:09
data validation i could choose bangalore and if you come and check here there is
2:04:14
no data validation but we have implemented data validation here now how is that done so i could select this or
2:04:22
for example i can go in here i can select data validation i can select list
2:04:29
and then here in the source i will say for bangalore the value should be these
2:04:36
and then if i basically say okay now
2:04:41
if we see these are the values which are fed into bangalore so we could do this or like what we have
2:04:49
done here so if you can check the data validation rule i have used list and then i have said
2:04:56
indirect f2 so basically i'm giving in a formula which relates to the value which is in
2:05:04
for the city maharashtra so we could do this or in a simpler way we could do
2:05:10
this and then just drag and drop here so we could check for maharashtra what are
2:05:16
the values let's choose a different city so for example kolkata and here i will choose
2:05:23
now since we did a drag and drop it has basically taken the values of
2:05:28
bank load so that's not right so we select this we go into data validation
2:05:33
and here i can either feed in the values that is such as
2:05:40
bangalore i could basically say something like this kolkata
2:05:45
and i could say okay so now if you see it shows me the places in kolkata
2:05:51
now here we have let's choose a different city so for example let's go for delhi and here
2:05:59
i can go to data validation and i can just say delhi so this is an easier way of doing it or
2:06:07
if you remember the formula then what you can do is you can just
2:06:13
give in indirect and then basically give the
2:06:19
value of the cell for which you would want to keep in the values so this is how you
2:06:25
can do list validation so you can provide a list of values and then you can restrict the values in a cell
2:06:34
which should be belonging to a particular list so this is how you do a simple data
2:06:41
validation by restricting the data in the form of a list
2:06:46
now let's learn about pivot charts and tables which is one more very useful
2:06:51
feature of excel and which allows you to work with your data or perform data
2:06:56
analysis now pivot table is a summary of your data
2:07:02
it is used in cases where there are numerous rows and columns in your data set
2:07:07
and it allows you to group your data in several ways so that you can derive
2:07:12
meaningful information from it now the visual representation of a pivot table is termed as a pivot chart now how do we
2:07:20
do that so let's see an example now here is some data here you see we have some
2:07:26
row labels which basically gives me some category of
2:07:31
items here it also tells me the sum of sales and basically it gives me per
2:07:38
item what is the total sum of sales which were made now how do i get this here
2:07:44
so for example if i would want to delete this and i would be interested in getting the
2:07:50
total sales under each category of items now we know that we have
2:07:56
different data here and it's huge for example on the
2:08:01
row end if i just do a control and right arrow it tells me what's my right last
2:08:07
column and if i just do a control and down arrow it tells me there are
2:08:13
9994 rows now i can use this and what i can do is
2:08:18
i can basically work on insert and go to pivot table now this
2:08:24
basically tells you need to choose the range now since i have chosen my first row and first
2:08:30
column it basically has selected the data and that's fine now do you want the
2:08:36
result in a new worksheet i'll say existing worksheet and i can choose a location now that basically needs me to
2:08:43
select a field might be we can just select this field and that should be good enough so
2:08:50
for example if i close this or if i say okay so
2:08:56
this is basically an indication that my pivot table will be created now what are the fields
2:09:01
we are interested in so as per the problem we need to find out what the total sales
2:09:06
for each category so let's go in here and let's select the field category now
2:09:13
as soon as you do that it shows that the rows which are
2:09:18
being selected are for this column category and now we are interested in
2:09:24
getting the sales so we would want the sales per category so let's select this
2:09:30
so you see some of sales is selected now close this and that's it that's that's
2:09:35
your data so it shows you row labels it tells you what are the different categories
2:09:41
and it also gives you sum of sales which is per category now
2:09:47
this is one easy example where we have solved the problem where we have tried to find
2:09:54
what were the total sales under each category of items so for example
2:10:00
let's have another data set so again you can just check how many rows we have
2:10:06
and it is basically the same 9994 and if i look in columns it basically
2:10:13
shows me profit is the last column and here we would want to find out
2:10:20
which category so for example let me get rid this with subcategory of items sold the maximum
2:10:27
under each category so we have some categories here which says
2:10:33
furniture and it shows some sub categories and then it shows me office supplies and
2:10:39
then some sub categories and same thing with technology now we know how we got this data but this is different than
2:10:46
what we were seeing here so here we were just getting the categories but but we did not have any breakdown
2:10:53
of sub categories within this particular category and here you see there is a breakdown
2:10:59
and then basically you can also apply a filter which basically says what is the
2:11:05
data you want and if you are interested in finding out a particular value now
2:11:10
how do we do this so for example let me get rid of this now we know how we can find out the
2:11:17
category of items but we would want to find out which subcategory of items sold
2:11:22
the maximum under each category so here we are not looking at sales but we are
2:11:28
looking at the quantity okay so what we can do is we can go to the
2:11:34
first row and first column click on insert click on pivot table
2:11:40
data is already selected let's choose existing worksheet let's choose a location in our worksheet where we would
2:11:46
want to have this so might be i can select this particular field and then just close this
2:11:54
so it says this is the existing worksheet say ok and now you need to select your
2:12:00
columns so for example if i would want the data for categories so
2:12:07
i can select this now i know that within category these are the options which we
2:12:13
have and then there is a sub category so let's select that and if you see here
2:12:19
now we have the data which will be filtered so based on your category and
2:12:24
subcategory and then we will choose quantity so it automatically understands that this is
2:12:31
something on which summation can be done so let's select this and close on this
2:12:37
now if you see here we have got our items where we can see
2:12:43
the sub categories within a particular category now i can basically close this
2:12:50
and that just shows me high level categories here so here
2:12:55
i can again select a particular row and column i can go for
2:13:05
either a new pivot table so we could basically select this the row is already
2:13:10
selected existing worksheet is what i want so now i will select
2:13:17
this particular place say okay now we do the same thing like
2:13:22
what we did earlier so we will select category sub category and quantity so
2:13:28
the data has already come in just select this and now you already have all your data but this is not what
2:13:35
we want we want to basically apply a filter to this now how do we do that so we can
2:13:42
go for slicer so i can go for insert slicer and then it tells what are
2:13:50
the sub categories which you are interested in so for example if i go for something like
2:13:58
subcategory and say okay so this tells me what are the categories you are
2:14:04
interested in so for example we know that furniture has furnishings with the highest value
2:14:10
so i can select say furnishings and then i was interested in office supplies
2:14:18
so within office supply i can basically search for
2:14:24
here binder so i can just do a control and
2:14:30
select binder and then i can also know for technology
2:14:35
i can select phones so i'll say control and select phones and now if you see the filter has been
2:14:41
applied and we have these sub categories which are selected so we have our data here
2:14:48
now we don't need really this so i can just delete this and i have my data which shows me
2:14:54
furniture being the main category and that has only furnishings office supply
2:14:59
having binders and technology having phones and that basically is a filter applied on the result of
2:15:08
your pivot so this is how we are seeing which sub category of items
2:15:13
were sold maximum for each category
2:15:18
so this is how you can easily use pivot tables and you can do some analysis let's look at some more examples
2:15:27
now let's see if you have to answer this question which says which were the top
2:15:33
three states for each region that made the highest average profit
2:15:39
now how do we calculate that so for example this is the data we have and as i have instructed earlier you can
2:15:47
select the first row and first column you can click on insert go into pivot table
2:15:52
and that basically selects all your data we will choose the result should be in this existing worksheet so select this
2:15:59
click here and then basically let's select
2:16:04
this cell and i will say okay so now my pivot table will be here so we are interested in
2:16:11
finding out top three states within each region which have made the highest
2:16:18
profit or which have made the highest average profit so for that first we will
2:16:24
select region so when we select region it shows
2:16:29
here region and within region you will then select state so
2:16:35
within every region you have multiple states so that's what we are selecting and then we are interested in looking at
2:16:42
the profit so let's select profit and that automatically shows up here so we can now say close this
2:16:49
so basically we have all the data but we are looking at the sum of profit but that's not what we want
2:16:55
we are looking for top three states from each region that
2:17:01
made the highest average profit now how do we change that so here we
2:17:08
have sum of profit so i can do a right click and basically i can say summarize values
2:17:13
by average so now i'm getting the average here and that basically tells per region
2:17:21
i have the average profit but first is let's sort this data so
2:17:27
let's go into sort more options and here i have average of profit
2:17:33
or for example as i said you can select region say okay and now it is basically having the
2:17:42
regions and then you have your state value so again we can do a
2:17:47
sorting here and i can say let's go for more sort options i'll say
2:17:53
descending the state values should be based on average profit so let's say okay and now
2:18:00
if you see in particular region we have the data which has been
2:18:06
sorted wherein you have the highest average profit on the top now what we can also do is we can
2:18:14
basically then go for filtering we can say top 10 but i'm not interested in top 10 so i
2:18:21
could reduce this to top three and this is the items average of profit
2:18:27
say okay and now you see per region you have
2:18:32
the data which is showing me top three states what are the average
2:18:38
and then you are also looking at the subtotal so which basically says average
2:18:43
profit for your west now if you would want to arrange this your west and south and east and central
2:18:52
in a particular alphabetical order if you would want to sort it you can always
2:18:57
do a sorting and you can choose sort z to a if that's what you would want to do or
2:19:04
you can go for sorting more sort options and you want to
2:19:11
sort the region which is as of now based on descending z2a let's make it
2:19:17
ascending say okay and now you see the data has been filtered so it says per
2:19:24
region now you can always select this and you can say what is this so this is
2:19:30
basically your average of profit now we are looking at
2:19:36
each region and the states the top three states as we wanted
2:19:41
within the region and what is the average now we have one more question what is
2:19:47
the percentage contribution of each sub category of products under each category
2:19:53
to the total sales so we know there are different products there are different categories and
2:20:00
all the categories contribute to the total sales so we would want to find out what is the percentage contribution of
2:20:07
each sub category of products under each category so we not only want
2:20:13
the category percentage but we would also want what is the contribution of each sub category
2:20:21
to each category to the total sales how do we do that so for that we need to again
2:20:29
just place our cursor here or select the first row and first column click on your insert
2:20:36
click on your pivot table and now the data is already selected existing worksheet
2:20:42
place your cursor here and then let's select this cell say okay
2:20:48
now your pivot table fields are here so we are interested in category
2:20:54
so let's select category and then within a category we will have subcategories and we are interested in
2:21:00
the sales data wherein it is already going to give us the sum of sales but we would want this
2:21:08
in the form of percentage rather than just the sum now we can click here value
2:21:14
field settings and it says if you would want to summarize this it says show value as
2:21:20
and what are the values you would want so you can straight away go ahead here and
2:21:26
say percentage of grand total so we could do that because we know we will get a sum of sales and grand
2:21:34
total now i could basically say in the percentage of grand total say okay and
2:21:40
then just close this so once you have closed this you see
2:21:46
already the data is in percentage so now we have our data with sub
2:21:52
categories but we also want the data to be sorted might be in a descending order
2:21:57
which tells which sub category is contributing more than others we can
2:22:03
select how many sub categories we are interested in so we can basically select
2:22:08
one of the sub category cells right click now you have option filter
2:22:14
and you have sorting so we can say more sort options now here i will say descending and you
2:22:22
want the descending to be sum of sales which is already showing as percentage
2:22:27
click on ok and now you see for each category it shows the percentage contribution
2:22:33
towards the sales it shows the sub categories contribution
2:22:39
to a particular category and also to total sales so
2:22:44
technically speaking if you look at all these values which are sub categories and if you would total them that would
2:22:51
be your total grand total so this is how we can solve a simple problem like this
2:22:56
what is the percentage contribution of each subcategory of products under each category to the total sales
2:23:06
the next question is which customer made the lowest profit in the home office segment in each state now here we know
2:23:13
that we are looking for home office segment we are looking for customer which made
2:23:20
the lowest profit we are also looking for the state as the main
2:23:26
criteria so in each state we would look for home office segment
2:23:32
and within that we would look for customer which has made the lowest profit that means
2:23:38
the lowest value of the profit so how do we do this so
2:23:44
let's say let's get into selecting our row and column we will go
2:23:49
into insert i'll say pivot table i'll say existing worksheet
2:23:54
and let me get my result here so let's say okay now that gives me the pivot
2:24:01
table so the first thing is we are looking at per state
2:24:08
and i would be interested in [Music]
2:24:13
home office segment or i could first start with segment
2:24:18
now here we have segment and in segment i can basically select home office so i
2:24:24
can just do a uncheck and select home office only and now i can select
2:24:31
state so that will be my sub category within segment and then
2:24:37
within state we would want to find out the customer so let's get the customer name
2:24:43
and we are interested in finding out the lowest profit so let's select profit and here we have sum of profits so the
2:24:50
fields are selected close this and now you have your data
2:24:55
which basically shows me the names of customers which made the profit but it's
2:25:02
it's not sorted so we can sort this and we have state entries also so that's
2:25:07
fine so what i can do is here i can basically say sorting go to more
2:25:14
sort options i can say i want to do it descending or i want to do an ascending
2:25:20
and ascending based on sum of profit so let's do that now you see
2:25:26
the topmost value is the lowest value per state within home office segment now what we
2:25:33
also want is we just want one value per state so how do we do that so we can
2:25:39
just go for filtering go for top 10 values i'm interested in bottom value and in
2:25:46
that also i'm looking for only the
2:25:52
lowest value so let's select one say okay and now you see we have data
2:26:00
for home office segment per state
2:26:05
customer who has made the lowest profit so we have easily answered this question
2:26:11
using our pivot table now say for example we have a question which says find the sales made in each
2:26:18
quarter of 2016 for all the regions so the data has to be divided quarterly
2:26:25
and use order year as a slicer we can do that by selecting what data we would
2:26:32
want to slice and then we would want to create a pivot chart also so for example
2:26:38
how do we do that so for example i will get rid of this
2:26:43
i will get rid of this my pivot chart which we can recreate
2:26:49
so find the sales made in each quarter of 2016 for all the regions
2:26:56
so this is what we want now how do we do this so for example let's select this
2:27:03
we will do a insert pivot table we will basically say existing worksheet
2:27:09
and then i can select this particular cell i'll say okay and now
2:27:14
i'm interested in data quarterly so first let's select
2:27:19
our field here so we should basically have
2:27:24
if all our fields are selected say for example if i say order date now
2:27:33
you see we have quarters and years which are selected
2:27:38
now we could be selecting these fields which says quarters years
2:27:45
and if i would want data to be filtered based on years i could do that or i could get rid of here so i have quarters
2:27:52
i have ordered date so that's being already selected now
2:28:00
what else we need we need to find out for every region so let's select the
2:28:07
region and we can also add region as a column here so that will basically give me all
2:28:14
the regions as different columns and then finally we want the sales so let's select this
2:28:22
and now let's look what we have so if you see here
2:28:28
we have our data which is for each quarter
2:28:35
it gives me the total data but what we would be interested in is not looking at
2:28:40
the total data but we are only interested in quarter of 2016. now how do we do that so what we
2:28:47
do here is we have row labels so let's click on this so we have date filters
2:28:53
and then in date filters we can go for between and then we will say 2016
2:29:00
and the value has to be 1 and then let's select this
2:29:06
and let's change this to 2016 and this is 12th month
2:29:14
and then we can say 31. so we are saying the date has to be
2:29:20
2016. and it basically says not a valid date
2:29:26
so let's select let's select a particular date and see so the month has to be here
2:29:33
so let's see in this and let's make it date and say okay
2:29:39
and now we have our data which is for 2016.
2:29:46
so for example i could basically select this and here
2:29:51
i could be looking at what are the filters we have so it says
2:29:56
clear filter from order data so we have applied the filter on order
2:30:01
date and these are your date filters which is
2:30:06
basically date 16 oh this is wrong so this one has to
2:30:12
be changed to 2016. so select this and now we have our data
2:30:18
for 2016. so we have found the sales made in each
2:30:24
quarter of 2016 for all the regions the grand total for a particular quarter if we are
2:30:31
looking at the value or for individual months in a particular quarter
2:30:37
and we have sliced the data now we could have also introduced a slicer by
2:30:45
selecting which field we would want to implement so for example if i would select a
2:30:51
particular field and then i could click on slicer i could choose i would want to
2:30:57
slice the date based on order date and then could have done it or we have just
2:31:02
given the date for 2016. now we just need to
2:31:08
plot a graph for this and that's very easy so you just need to select
2:31:14
the complete pivot data and here you have the chart options so let's go for
2:31:19
line chart and that basically shows me the line chart so we can select this
2:31:26
we can just drag and drop it here and then we can basically check if that is
2:31:33
showing us the data so if you see here this is line chart where it has divided
2:31:38
the regions in different colors so we have all the regions we could filter out in pivot chart a particular
2:31:44
region we have the quarterly time here in order data the filter is
2:31:52
applied it says it is 2016. in quarters it tells me it is 16. so we
2:31:59
have our data we have created a pivot chart and basically we have sliced the data
2:32:05
for 2016. let's answer one more question and that's finding the profit made in
2:32:12
each year for all the categories of products
2:32:17
in east and west regions only and then we would want to create a histogram
2:32:23
for the same pivot table so histogram usually gives us the frequencies so
2:32:29
let's look at how do we calculate the profit made in each year for all the categories so what i can do is
2:32:36
i can basically select my
2:32:42
row id here and now i'll do a pivot table so the data is already selected i'll
2:32:48
choose existing worksheet let's select this particular cell say okay now what are we interested in now if you
2:32:55
look at the fields we don't see any years or quarters and so on so for
2:33:00
example here i can just choose order date and then basically
2:33:06
i can choose say for example years or quarters
2:33:12
the data which is coming out from my order date so here i will just select
2:33:17
years now then i have my order date
2:33:24
so we are interested in the years orders
2:33:29
and we are interested in let's look at our column or the question
2:33:36
what we had here so we have years find the profit made in each year so
2:33:43
let's select profit so that basically says sum of profit
2:33:49
but then i'm on also interested in for all the categories of products so
2:33:56
what i can do is here i have my field which is category and
2:34:03
that i'll add to the columns so that shows me what are the different categories
2:34:08
and this looks fine now i'm also interested in east and west regions so
2:34:14
that is basically in the region so either we could add a slicer or we could do a filtering here by adding the
2:34:20
filters so first is i'll click on region and here it says select all i'm only
2:34:26
interested in east and west so let's select this take this
2:34:33
put it here let's say okay and now we have the data which has been filtered
2:34:40
based on the region so here we have region so you can always look at the filter it is east and west
2:34:47
and we have our year data per year we have
2:34:53
different categories you can always look at what are these column labels so this is my different categories and this is
2:35:01
the profit per category and then you have your grand total so we
2:35:07
have already our data now let's say close this so we have our data for all these years
2:35:14
different categories the profits made per year and if i would want i could go into an
2:35:20
year and i could look into different months so that also is showing up and now we would want to
2:35:28
basically plot a histogram with this data so i can just
2:35:33
place my cursor here i can select this and then i can go into insert and here i
2:35:40
have different options so we can go for bar chart we can go for insert hierarchy chart
2:35:47
we can go into waterfall funnel stock surface or radar chart so there are different options what you have here and
2:35:54
we will go for a simple histogram which is two dimensional let's select this and
2:36:00
here you see you can obviously select different regions you have your ears which shows up
2:36:08
you have your order date and then you have your categories which can be chosen for your histogram or for
2:36:16
your bar chart and that basically is how you use your pivot table you use some
2:36:21
calculations and then you can plot your needed graph to visualize the data and
2:36:27
understand it in a better way hi everyone welcome to this tutorial on
Sorting and filtering in excel data analysis
2:36:33
microsoft excel let's look at an example of one more useful function
2:36:40
in excel and that is vlookup now vlookup is used to see if a value exists in a
2:36:47
range of values and we can create a range of values which is nothing but a block of cells which has a name
2:36:56
and can be referenced so mainly to use vlookup we need to create a named range
2:37:02
and that can be referenced anywhere in the workbook or the other option is you can always drag and select
2:37:10
uh the range of data in which you would want to search something now there is also
2:37:16
other functions such as hlookup which pretty much does the same thing however
2:37:22
it does it horizontally that is left to right instead of vertically there are other functions like lookup and x lookup
2:37:28
and so on so when we talk about vlookup let's see how we do that so for example
2:37:34
this is the range of or this is the data which has been given to you and here is
2:37:40
the question find the employee name with employee id 107. now assume that you
2:37:46
might have huge amount of data and you may want to search something so how do we do it now here i have
2:37:53
created some column and then some basic formatting i have given it as an employee id i've given employee name now
2:38:01
what i can do is i can create a range of data now how do i do that or a named
2:38:07
range so what you can do is you can select the data and then you can do a right click now here you have something
2:38:15
like get data from table range so you can do that you can define a name
2:38:20
so you can click on this and here you can give a
2:38:26
name to the range what you would want to call it so for example let's say our
2:38:32
search now that's the named range i'm creating and just say okay so the scope is
2:38:39
workbook and i've created a named range which you can see here so it shows for
2:38:46
search our search so you have created a named range now how do we do a vlookup
2:38:52
here so for that we can use a formula so for example i would want to search for
2:38:58
employee name where employee id is whatever you would want to search for
2:39:04
so employee id we can give here 107. now that's what we would want to search then
2:39:11
employee name for and employee name is what we are interested now what we can do is we can
2:39:16
use the function option here i can do a insert function and that shows me
2:39:21
different functions which are here now vlookup is showing up because i have recently searched for it or
2:39:28
you can basically just type in here look and you can do a go so that shows you
2:39:35
all the lookup options what you have like lookup edge lookup match vlookup and so on so we would be interested in
2:39:42
vlookup so let's select that and click on ok now that basically opens up this
2:39:48
function arguments and it shows what does this function do so it says looks
2:39:53
for a value in the leftmost column of a table and then returns a value in the same row
2:40:00
from a column you specify by default the table must be sorted in
2:40:05
an ascending order now you can basically say this is what you would
2:40:10
want to search for what is the lookup value if you place your cursor here it says what is the table array that is
2:40:17
nothing but the range which we can use our named range here we have the column
2:40:23
index number which basically tells me what is the column number in the range
2:40:29
which we want so what is the value we want from which column and then basically you have range lookup
2:40:37
which basically is the fourth option and range lookup is nothing but
2:40:42
it can have two values so true or false so true basically means closest match
2:40:49
and then false should be an exact match so let's do that so for lookup value we
2:40:56
would want to give a particular value which is nothing
2:41:01
but we would be interested in say employee name
2:41:06
so i can basically search for a value based on the lookup
2:41:12
value now how do we do it so we are saying we would want to search for employee id which is 107. so what i can
2:41:20
do is i can select this cell here which tells that this is the
2:41:27
value or employee id for which i would want to search the employee name i could
2:41:33
actually select the cell here which is h so that whatever value you feed in here
2:41:40
you can search for that value so might be we can select this one which is h6
2:41:45
and whatever value we key in here we will be searching for employee name for
2:41:50
that employee id now table array is we would want to give
2:41:55
a range so what we can do is we can give our range so for example we had selected
2:42:02
something like our search and if you see here that already selects
2:42:08
or shows me employee id employee name email address so it gives me the range
2:42:13
now column index number so which column are we interested in that means
2:42:21
what is the value we are searching for so we are searching for employee name which is the second column so i can just
2:42:27
say 2 and that basically is the column number and then you have to give a range lookup
2:42:34
which is a logical value so either you give an exact match or you can basically give a
2:42:41
closest match so we can say for example do a 0 which basically means false or
2:42:48
you can say 1 which is true so let's go for 0 now that's our formula so it says
2:42:53
vlookup you will search for the value as per h6 in the range and then you are looking
2:43:01
for employee name which is column number two and then true or false so let's
2:43:07
click on ok and that basically gives me the value which is parallel
2:43:12
birch so here i'm searching for employee name and you can basically drag this
2:43:19
for other columns and you can do that so if it finds employee
2:43:26
id here now say for example if we had an employee id somebody enters an employee
2:43:32
id which is not in the range for example let's try 121 and then you see this is basically
2:43:40
an error right because it does not have any employee id with
2:43:45
121. now how do i take care of this so there is a formula which is called if
2:43:51
error and that can be used to take care of this so if the value is not found then it
2:43:58
will show whatever i would want to show here so what i can do is i can
2:44:05
still select this and what i can do is i can search in function
2:44:11
say for example this is the function we are looking at but what we can do is
2:44:16
we can test it here so for example if i look in function and if i search for
2:44:22
error and say oh go so there are lots of functions here and this is the function
2:44:28
we are interested in if error so if i say okay now this takes the value and
2:44:34
what is the value if error so for value what i can do is basically
2:44:40
i can select the value from here which is nothing but our vlookup formula and value if error
2:44:48
so for example i will basically say for example not found so we can try this and
2:44:56
we can say okay now here it says not found so whenever it is n a it is not
2:45:01
found now if we look at the formula here it says
2:45:06
if error it takes the value of h7 which is nothing but our vlookup and then it
2:45:12
is showing us the value which we have entered so for example if i would say
2:45:17
107 like earlier and then hit on enter so it says panel
2:45:23
of cruise and it shows us the value right and if we enter something else
2:45:31
then basically here it shows any and it shows not found but what we want to do is we want to
2:45:38
merge these two so what i can do is i can get rid of
2:45:43
or i can basically take this one now what i would want is i want this formula
2:45:51
to be here so what i can do is i can say if
2:45:57
error and then basically given your vlookup
2:46:02
option or function here and then say for example not found here
2:46:09
not found now that basically will take care of any kind of error if the value
2:46:14
is not found so when we say 121 it basically says not found but if i say
2:46:20
107 which is found then it shows me the value so we are using vlookup but then
2:46:27
we are also using if error which will take care of our error message or
2:46:33
basically the not applicable pound not applicable to replaced with
2:46:38
whatever value we key in similarly we can do the same thing here so we have the find the job title so we
2:46:45
are interested in finding out the job title once the employee name is given now employee name can basically have a
2:46:53
value from the cell or whatever value you would want to key in
2:46:59
how do we do it so we basically start with our v lookup so that's the function
2:47:06
we are interested in so you can just do a double click now you are interested in finding out the
2:47:12
value whichever is given here so that's the lookup value
2:47:17
and then you are interested in finding out the job title from the range
2:47:23
so i will still give our range which basically also shows for example let's do a
2:47:33
double click here and that basically selects the range and now i'm interested in finding out
2:47:39
the job title so that's column number four and then i can just give zero which is
2:47:46
for false so now we have given our vlookup but that shows not applicable because we
2:47:52
have not given any employee name so we can key in the value here which says
2:47:57
fred stone and now if we are basically giving the value so
2:48:03
fred stone now we will have to search if there is any
2:48:09
job title which is fred stone so here is the value so that should be showing up let's check
2:48:16
what has gone wrong so we are giving our range we are interested in
2:48:23
finding out the value but what the mistake what we did here was that when we want to search for a value
2:48:31
say for example let's take this vlookup and let's replace this value of h12 with
2:48:39
the value here so and then basically we will give our
2:48:46
range we will save which is the column we are interested in and then give true or false so
2:48:53
we can also basically take care of this error message so for example let's take this
2:48:59
complete formula from here and just
2:49:07
just copy this formula and now we can put in here the formula
2:49:15
but then this is where we were searching for h6 which was employee id
2:49:21
now that's not what we are interested in we are interested in finding out the
2:49:27
value so let's take this one and replace this
2:49:32
with the value given here and then i give my range i say which is
2:49:40
the column i'm interested in so i'm interested in looking for job title and then let's search so it basically
2:49:47
tells me not found so let's check this now the error which we were facing was
2:49:54
because when we talk about your vlookup let's look at the formula again and here
2:50:00
say for example i go for function and then i select vlookup and say for
2:50:06
example i say ok now just look at the description here looks for a value in the left most
2:50:13
column of a table now earlier the range which we had selected had the left most column as
2:50:20
employee id and that's why it was giving an error so how do we fix that so for
2:50:26
example let's basically
2:50:32
remove this function from here now what we want to do is we would want
2:50:37
to search for the stock broker now if you see here i have given a range which
2:50:43
is b 1 to d 21 so we would want
2:50:48
the value for what we would want to search say employee name that should be the left most column so
2:50:56
so that's how we have our function so let's do that so say for example the name is given here
2:51:03
so we want a range so either we can create a range like earlier by selecting
2:51:10
say for example this data now am i interested in salary no i'm interested
2:51:15
in job title right so i can basically just select these three columns and then i can define a name so i can
2:51:24
say our search to and let's give a named range and that's
2:51:30
only because we would want to easily reference or use that named
2:51:35
search or named range now here we would want to use vlookup but we would also do
2:51:42
an if error now within that we can say we
2:51:48
look up and then you need to select what is the value what your
2:51:55
function takes so basically this is my function we will say if the value is not found
2:52:02
then we will give this so you can create an external structure and then within your vlookup we will say
2:52:09
the leftmost column which we are interested in so that's your employee name
2:52:16
so in employee name we have the value so either i can directly select the value
2:52:22
here in the column b or i will give the value whichever is fed in here the
2:52:27
employee name then i need to give a range so let's select our range so that's your hour
2:52:34
search too and then you need to select the column number
2:52:39
so we are interested in finding out the job title so that's the third column so let's say three and then just give a
2:52:46
zero and then hit on enter so it says not found because you have not given any employee name now
2:52:53
let's try to find the job title of fred stone so i can just select or i can say equal
2:53:00
and then i can just given a value and that basically shows me the job title so this is how you use vlookup
2:53:07
we have also used if error which basically takes care of error message if
2:53:12
the value is not found so for example we can test this here we have fred stone
2:53:18
so for example if i just empty this and i point it to
2:53:24
something which does not exist so that shows me not found or if you just select
2:53:29
this and then key in a value it shows you this might be we can just type in so
2:53:35
if i say fred then basically it says not found because we are looking for exact match
2:53:42
now if we had changed this to the closest match something like this then it would have
2:53:49
tried to find something but then we don't have anything which is just with this so there are different ways of
2:53:55
doing it so what we can do is we can always go for the exact match
2:54:02
and that's basically the value and here we can basically key in any value for
2:54:09
example i would be interested in finding out this one and let's give this so you can search in
2:54:16
this way so you can also have statements which can be searching one related to
2:54:22
other now here the question was to find the job title of fred stone so let's type in
2:54:27
fred stone and that basically shows me the job title which we are interested in
2:54:33
so let's search for job title let's go for exact match and
2:54:40
then search so it is stock broker so if getting your learning started is half the battle what if you could do that for
2:54:47
free visit scale up by simply learn click on the link in the description to know more
2:54:53
now that we have looked at vlookup it would be interesting to see how
2:54:58
horizontal lookup or edge lookup works it basically works in the on the same
2:55:03
lines but here instead of vertically searching through the columns the range is more of horizontally
2:55:11
defined so we search in rows rather than in columns so for
2:55:16
example this is the data which has been given to you and you have various columns so you have employee id you have
2:55:23
your employee name you have employee email address
2:55:29
you basically have the job title of different employees
2:55:34
and then basically you have the salary so this is the data which has been given to you and you are asked to search or
2:55:42
you are interested in finding out say the salary based on employee name or
2:55:47
job title based on employee id so what we need to do is we need to define the
2:55:52
range here now range can depend on what you are searching for so for example when i'm
2:55:59
searching employee name and salary so i am interested in these four rows
2:56:06
when i'm saying employee id and job title then might be this is the range and i don't need salary so i can create
2:56:13
a named range if we are interested in so that we can easily search for it or we
2:56:18
can straight away give the the first cell value which is basically
2:56:24
a one here and then the last value here which is g and then you can
2:56:31
give five so you can do that or you can create a named range whichever way you
2:56:36
would want to do it so for example we would want to create a named range for our first question which is
2:56:44
find the salary of edin connell using h lookup so we are interested in this so
2:56:50
let's select these four rows all the way for your
2:56:55
columns now like we did earlier we can just define a name might be we can call
2:57:01
it our search three and we can just give okay so that's the
2:57:08
named range which we have created now what we would want is we want to
2:57:13
search for the salary based on employee name so here we can insert our function
2:57:20
so let's look up and let's search for look and just click on co so here you have h
2:57:27
lookup and basically that's the function i'm interested in say okay so this says
2:57:32
what is the lookup value which you are interested in so we are interested in finding out the value based on the
2:57:38
employee name so for example let's select this cell that gives us more dynamism and you can
2:57:46
add in any name and you can search for the salary or you can basically give the employee
2:57:53
name exactly from the employee name value here which is d
2:57:58
two so we can give addin conal from here so let's select this now table array so
2:58:06
we need to give our range so let's say our search three then you need to give the row index
2:58:12
number now this is different than vlookup in vlookup you have column index number and here you have row index
2:58:19
number so what are you interested in searching for so we are interested in searching for salary now in our range
2:58:26
that is basically the fourth row remember we created a range from employee name to salary so let's give
2:58:34
the row index number which is 4 and the range lookup will say 0 which is
2:58:40
basically exact match and that completes our formula so click on ok and that
2:58:45
basically gives me the salary for edin connell now that's basically because we have fed
2:58:53
in the value here and that is basically giving me this so i can again
2:58:59
do if error if i would be interested in to basically take care of error message
2:59:04
if the value is not found for that you can look into the previous example which is vlookup now similarly we are
2:59:11
interested in finding out the job title for employee id one zero five how do we
2:59:17
do that so we need to use hlookup well we could have done with vlookup but
2:59:23
here the data is more arranged in the form of rows so how do we do that so we can again use
2:59:30
hlookup but and we can give a range or named range or let's for this time
2:59:36
let's basically key in our range manually so we can do that so let's go
2:59:42
for h lookup now what do we want to search for so we will say this is the value
2:59:49
then we need to give a range now as i said if you would want to give a range manually so for example i'll say
2:59:57
a and then i'll say a 1 colon and then i'm interested in
3:00:05
g and then the row will be 4 so salary row is not what we are we are not interested
3:00:11
in so let's say g and then we can give 4 so that basically gives me the range
3:00:18
right instead of having a named range so we can do that and then we need to give
3:00:23
the row index number so we are interested in finding out the job title which is basically in our range the
3:00:30
fourth row and then give zero for true or false so if you see here it tells if it is one
3:00:37
it is approximate match false is an exact match and we can close
3:00:42
this bracket that completes our formula it takes the value which is given in employee id and then it will try to
3:00:49
search for the job title so that basically shows wherever the employee id
3:00:55
is 105 the job title is fabricator again you can use if error
3:01:02
wherein your if error can then be working on hlookup and can take care of error so
3:01:09
that if an employee id is keyed in for which there is no matching value
3:01:15
then it will not show you a not applicable error in
3:01:21
instead of that it will replace with the word whatever you have specified so in
3:01:26
this way you can easily use hlookup to search from the range of data which is
3:01:33
horizontally arranged and in the previous example we were seeing how you use
3:01:38
vlookup when the data is arranged vertically so we have looked at
3:01:44
vlookup and hlookup and what we have seen is vlookup has a limitation in one
3:01:51
way that we need to basically give a range where the leftmost column is the one which is
3:01:58
used now instead of that we might be interested in searching in specific
3:02:04
columns and not all the columns well that can also affect the time taken to
3:02:10
search for the data when we can select particular columns or
3:02:15
particular ranges rather than selecting all the data which has to be searched for so for example we have this question
3:02:23
find the salary of hank saunders now that's the employee name which we
3:02:29
have here and we would want to find out the salary so what are the columns we are interested in so one is your employee
3:02:36
name and one is your salary and these are the only two columns which we are interested in so instead of using
3:02:42
vlookup now like i've shown earlier you can create a named range for these two
3:02:47
columns and you can use that or we can manually give the range here so let's go
3:02:53
for lookup function here and lookup function will basically help us in
3:02:58
searching what we are interested in so we are interested in finding out the
3:03:03
employee name and we are interested in finding out the salary based on the employee name so how
3:03:10
do we do that so here in lookup i can first give the value which is here
3:03:16
employee name now whatever employee name is keyed in here we will
3:03:23
be searching for salary of that employee now lookup function needs a lookup value
3:03:29
so we are searching based on employee name then it says
3:03:34
lookup vector so we will basically then say what is going to be our lookup vector so
3:03:42
here we need to give a range so what are we interested in we are interested in
3:03:48
finding out the salary based on employee name so first goes our range
3:03:54
based on which we need to search so that's your employee name so let's for example select this one so that's our
3:04:02
range b1 to b21 so that will basically have the employee name in which we will be searching for
3:04:09
and then we are interested in searching out the the result vector that is basically the
3:04:15
column from which we want the value that's our salary column so let's select this
3:04:20
and that completes our lookup function so now if you hit on enter it shows
3:04:26
that for this employee where the name is hunk saunders the salary is 5400 now you
3:04:34
can test it by basically giving some other name so for
3:04:39
example if i replace this with say fred stone
3:04:45
and that basically shows me the value for fredstone we can replace it to the question which we have that is hank
3:04:52
saunders and that shows me the salary so that's a simple example of lookup which
3:04:58
allows you to search by selecting a range of columns rather than having the left most column which has to be
3:05:04
referenced similarly we have one more question find the employee id
3:05:10
of this particular email id so we need to again use our lookup function so we'll
3:05:16
say lookup now what are we interested in we will search based on this email address so i will select this
3:05:23
then i need to give that based on email address we are searching the employee id so email
3:05:30
address is in this column so let's select this range and then we are interested in employee
3:05:35
id so then goes our result vector so select this column and that basically completes your
3:05:42
formula so close this bracket and hit on enter so that basically shows me the employee id for an employee with this
3:05:50
email address so this is how you use lookup now as i've explained earlier you
3:05:56
can be using the if error and you can basically see how
3:06:02
your index match can be used now here is an example of if error
3:06:07
so basically this shows how if error helps so say for example as i showed in
3:06:13
your sheet one so check for employee james bond if the value is not present
3:06:18
display not found and what are we doing we are basically nesting our vlookup
3:06:25
inside if error with a not found option which basically says if the value
3:06:32
given in the cell h is not found then basically
3:06:38
it will display not found so here you also notice that the range which has been
3:06:44
given has been selected that is b1 to c21 now we could have used a named range
3:06:52
which basically helps us in searching for multiple functions we are searching for 2 that is the
3:07:00
column number 2 here that is employee name so check for employee james bond if
3:07:05
the value is not present or no so we are basically just searching for employee
3:07:10
name here and then give your 0 or 1. so that's basically usage of your if error
3:07:17
which i have shown earlier and the same thing can be applied for your edge lookup
3:07:22
also now suppose you have been given some additional questions for example
3:07:29
you know instead of using your vlookup or edge lookup or lookup examples what
3:07:34
we have seen say for example you are asked to find the salary of peter daniels now we
3:07:41
already know how to find that using vlookup right so for example we want to
3:07:47
find out the salary for this employee name which is peter daniels i can use a
3:07:52
vlookup however sometimes we may also want to use a index match an index match
3:07:59
is also one useful function to do that so we can basically search based on that
3:08:05
so we have to define the range of data we have to then say what do we want to
3:08:11
match so that's basically an employee name and then we are interested in finding
3:08:17
out say for example based on the range
3:08:22
of employees you would want to find out the value of salary so we are then
3:08:30
giving a range and doing it how do we do that so for example here i can use a
3:08:37
function which is called index and if you see here it says returns a value or reference of the cell
3:08:45
at the intersection of a particular row and column in a given range so this is
3:08:51
where index function can be useful now we can start with this function it says it needs an array that's nothing but a
3:08:58
range so we can basically select all our data so i can say a1
3:09:04
all the way to e21 so that basically is my range now i would want to find the salary of
3:09:12
this employee name which is peter daniels so i can use internally here
3:09:18
basically you need to give a row number so what we can do is we can do a match
3:09:26
so we can use an internal function match now we need to basically
3:09:31
give it correctly so we need to say match now how does this match function work so
3:09:38
we need to basically match for a value so for example we will select whatever
3:09:44
employee name is given here so that's peter daniels now that's basically what we would want to match
3:09:50
now where do we want to match this so we want to match in the column b which has
3:09:56
employee names so we can give a range which is b1
3:10:02
to be 21 so that's basically within the employee names we are looking
3:10:09
for a match which is given here that's in h6
3:10:15
and we want to do a match so we want to do a exact match so let's do a comma
3:10:21
zero and then we are interested in finding out the salary
3:10:27
based on this match and salary is in our fifth column so let's basically give the
3:10:32
column number here and then just close this bracket so that basically
3:10:38
completes your function and just hit on enter so that shows me
3:10:43
the salary of peter daniels right so this is an easy way when you can use the
3:10:50
index function remember first you give the range and then you need to give your
3:10:56
matching condition so when you say match i would take the value whatever is given in this cell
3:11:02
i will search in the range of values which is employee names i will find an exact match and what i'm
3:11:09
interested in is finding the salary for peter daniels now similarly say for
3:11:15
example you have been given a question find the employee id with salary 10 000
3:11:21
so you want to find out the employee id wherever the salary is 10 000 so we are
3:11:28
obviously looking for an exact match now how do we do that so we can start with
3:11:33
our index function and with an index function we need to give a range so for example i am interested in
3:11:40
finding out say for example our range which is a 1
3:11:47
2 e 21 so that's what i'm interested in or you are actually interested in
3:11:54
searching based on say your salary so you are interested in
3:12:00
searching the employee id so maybe if i just do a 821 let's see what happens here
3:12:06
now then i can just do a match so match will be now done based on the
3:12:13
value which is here h 13 so i will do a match for this one now i
3:12:19
need to give a range so let's basically give a range which will be we
3:12:26
are interested in searching employee id based on the salary column so that's your e column so
3:12:33
i will say e1 to e 21 that's what i'm interested in searching
3:12:40
finding a match for this salary we want an exact match so first let's close this
3:12:46
one now that's fine i mean we are interested in finding out the employee id
3:12:53
based on the match which is within this range and then what we would want to do is we
3:13:00
would want to basically find the employee id employee id is in my
3:13:06
column a so what i can do is i can additionally give a match here
3:13:11
and then i can say i'm interested in the finding out the value for employee id
3:13:17
and that basically needs a range so the range here will be just the
3:13:23
the column headings so we will give a1 all the way to e 1 so that's the range
3:13:31
in which we would want to search and we would want to find a match for employee id we want an exact match so let's close
3:13:39
this one and that basically closes my match and we need to close our index function so now that shows me employee
3:13:46
id where the salary is 10 000. so this is how you can do your index
3:13:52
matches where you can give a range then you can say what you need to match
3:13:58
within which particular column whether it is an exact match or approximate match and then the column from where you
3:14:06
are interested in finding out the value so same thing we did here we basically gave a complete range and
3:14:13
if you closely see we were only interested in finding out the employee id so here i give a range
3:14:20
a1 to 821 which is basically this particular column so that's where we are
3:14:25
interested in finding out match basically will give your lookup value so that's h13
3:14:32
then we gave a range which is salary that's what we are interested in and then we said when we are doing a match
3:14:39
we are only interested in finding out the employee id which is in a range of column names and
3:14:46
then doing an exact match so this is how you can use index match instead of
3:14:51
lookup which can also give you some exceptions and searching for
3:14:57
specific columns or specific rows now if error we have already discussed
3:15:02
where you nest your vlookup or h lookup inside it so this is how you can use your lookup
3:15:09
functions hlookup vlookup lookup or index match to search
3:15:14
for data some function like this which shows up xln dot x lookup
3:15:22
and then you're trying to search for something so don't be uh surprised with that so xln is basically
3:15:29
a prefix added to functions that don't exist in the version of excel you are using
3:15:35
you have excel 2013 and say your friend has a new version of excel say office
3:15:41
365 or excel 2016 and basically he uses your
3:15:46
new cool function and sends the file to you so that's where you will have this
3:15:52
xln prefix as i'm showing up here so for example what is the job title of xavier
3:15:58
power is what you would want to search and here the function which shows up
3:16:03
excel and x lookup and then you are searching so this is basically something which is the function now if i
3:16:11
just select what it has selected here and if i hit on enter it shows that this
3:16:17
does not work in my excel here and that's because of the version but what i
3:16:23
can do is i can fix this by removing this
3:16:28
details here and that basically shows lookup we are searching for
3:16:33
job title based on employee name which is in this field h6
3:16:39
and then we need to give a range so we need to give a range of names employee
3:16:44
name and then basically the job title range which is basically the job title
3:16:51
so now if i just hit on enter it gives me the value so it's as simple as that
3:16:57
similarly here what is the employee id of the person with this email we have already looked
3:17:02
at the lookup function so if it shows your xlnx lookup all you need to do is
3:17:08
remove this and then keep the lookup function searching for the value
3:17:13
based on the range of values and then searching for a value within a range of
3:17:19
values so just hit on enter and that gives you the value and same thing goes
3:17:25
for this job title so what is the job title and salary of employee name
3:17:31
so we have this function now what i can do is here i am interested in finding out the
3:17:38
value for this particular function how do i fix this i can basically select
3:17:43
this and then just do a lookup based on the values
3:17:48
and it basically says you can't change part of an array so we can fix this now what
3:17:55
we need to do is we need to basically search based on this particular value so we will
3:18:02
basically say i want to do a lookup now lookup should be based on employee
3:18:09
name whatever name is given here then you need to find the job title in
3:18:15
salary so for job title i want to find based on employee name so i will give a
3:18:22
range and then basically i will say i'm interested in finding out the job title
3:18:29
so i will give a different range and then basically close this
3:18:34
so that basically shows now this is basically because of the
3:18:40
function which we have here so basically to fix this what we will have to do is we will have to delete all the columns
3:18:48
here which were selected such as employee name job title and salary because that was giving you
3:18:54
an error you cannot delete a part of an array now what we want to do is we want
3:18:59
to find the job title and salary based on the employee name so we can do that
3:19:05
using lookup as we have done earlier so we will use a lookup function now what
3:19:11
we are interested in finding out is the job title based on employee name so we
3:19:16
can select this cell which does not have any value then we need to basically say from which
3:19:24
range or based on what you want to search so we want to search based on
3:19:29
employee name and we want to find out the job title so we can basically give a range of values
3:19:37
and then we will be interested in finding out the job title so let's select the job title range and
3:19:44
that basically completes our lookup so let's close this and hit on enter now it
3:19:50
says obviously error because this does not have any value we will fix that by giving in a value
3:19:56
here same thing we can do for salary so for example i can just drag and drop it here
3:20:03
and in this one instead of basically having a range which is your
3:20:11
we will be interested in finding out the salary so
3:20:16
let's see what is the range we give so the range should be employee name
3:20:22
so we will basically select employee name as the range
3:20:28
and then we are interested in finding out the salary so we will select this
3:20:36
particular range and what we are interested in finding out is basically
3:20:41
employee name or we are interested in finding out based on employee name so let's select
3:20:49
this particular column and then hit on enter so both of these are any values now just feed in an employee name so we
3:20:56
will say for example eduardo and that basically gives me the job title and
3:21:02
salary so that's how you can fix your excel fn error so same thing goes here
3:21:10
so it shows you xln is what you would want to search might be if you don't find something you would want to
3:21:17
push in name not found so first is we will have to fix this part so we will
3:21:23
have to remove this because that's not supported in my excel and then i have lookup i am searching based on h24
3:21:32
which is basically employee id you are giving a range which is a2 to 821
3:21:37
because we would want to find name not found
3:21:42
for a particular employee id so i'm giving a range which is a2 to 821
3:21:48
i'm trying to search for the name which is from b2 to b21 and then i'm giving
3:21:55
name not found so say for example we can do this lookup but then
3:22:01
with lookup you don't have this direct option what we can do is we can use if
3:22:07
error if error and then basically try to
3:22:12
search so that gives your lookup value and then you will have to close this one
3:22:19
and then again if it gives you some error like this we can obviously go for
3:22:24
vlookup and fix this so here we are searching for a particular range
3:22:31
and then let's search for this value and basically to fix this what i did was
3:22:37
i just use a vlookup so we know that employee id 121 does not exist so i'm
3:22:43
just using if error i'm doing a vlookup where i'm searching for the value given
3:22:49
in h 19 and then i'm saying that i would want to search
3:22:55
from a range which is basically b1 to c21 that is in employee name and say
3:23:02
email address for example and we would want to basically search
3:23:07
for name not found so we can instead of giving b21 or b1 to c21 we
3:23:15
can restrict it to just b1 to b21 we are searching in column two we are
3:23:21
searching for exact value and if it does not find then it says name not found and
3:23:27
that's how we do it so we can always replace and fix this excel fn
3:23:33
errors if you are using
3:23:38
uh some spreadsheet which was or excel which was sent by
3:23:43
someone else who is using a different version so in this way we can use your tickle different look up functions
3:23:51
take care of your errors use a index match welcome to this tutorial on
Data analysis using toolpak in excel data analysis
3:23:57
microsoft excel let's quickly see some more examples of doing data
3:24:04
analysis using excel and for that we can use
3:24:09
some inbuilt add-ins which can be added to our excel sheet so for example if you
3:24:14
would want to do a descriptive analytics or descriptive analysis on your data say for example getting your
3:24:21
descriptive statistics such as your mean median mode and so on so we can do that
3:24:28
and we can use excel for it so for example you can if you are given some
3:24:33
data say i have temperature price of ice cream units sold and i would want to
3:24:39
have descriptive statistics on this what i can do is i can click on file
3:24:44
and here in file you can click on options and within options click on
3:24:49
add-ins now within add-ins you have excel add-ins which is selected here so click
3:24:56
on say go for example and that shows what add-ins are available and you can
3:25:02
choose which ones are you interested in so for example i have chosen analysis tool pack
3:25:08
and solver add-in and click on ok now that basically should add more options
3:25:14
to your excel so if you click on data so here you see data analysis and solver
3:25:21
and this is what we would want to use to get our descriptive statistics for these three columns so for example let's say
3:25:29
temperature or you can even give the names later once you get your descriptive statistics
3:25:36
so for example let's go for data analysis and here it says what are you
3:25:41
interested in there is a two factor with replication you have correlation covariance
3:25:47
descriptive statistics you have histogram so let's click on descriptive statistics click on ok
3:25:54
now this one basically asks your input range so while your cursor is blinking
3:26:00
here also it is said grouped by so let's give it a range so
3:26:07
for example i will say say temperature now if i do this and i have selected the
3:26:13
heading just look at that and now you need an output range so let's just select this
3:26:19
and then you can have your cursor blinking here let's select save fields here
3:26:27
and this is where i would want the output now it also said what options do you want so it has output range we can
3:26:34
then select summary statistics confidence level so i will say summary statistics is what i'm interested in say
3:26:41
okay and this says input input range contains non-numeric data now why is that because
3:26:48
we chose temperature the heading also so click on ok and here we will alter the
3:26:55
range so this one is our range should be
3:27:00
only the values numeric values on which we would want the descriptive statistics we
3:27:07
have output range already selected we have summary statistics and now you can click on ok and that basically gives
3:27:16
your descriptive statistics for temperature so here i could basically
3:27:23
given a value for this so i can say temperature and that's my descriptive statistics for
3:27:29
temperature might be i can just do some formatting and
3:27:35
that's it so that gives me descriptive statistics for the values here
3:27:40
now similarly we can do it for price of ice cream so what we need is
3:27:47
we need to basically go for data data analysis
3:27:54
descriptive statistics say okay now you need to give a range so here i
3:28:00
will change my range to these values output range is already selected
3:28:07
now we are interested in summary statistics click on ok and this says output range will
3:28:13
overwrite existing data press ok to overwrite data in range i will say cancel no that's not what we
3:28:20
want to do we need to give a new range so let's select our new range which is here
3:28:28
and now click on ok so now we get the values which is for
3:28:33
your price of ice cream so again we can basically
3:28:38
select this and say price of ice cream
3:28:43
and we got our descriptive statistics for price of ice cream and like we did earlier i can select
3:28:50
this i can basically do a merge and center and that gives me descriptive
3:28:56
statistics for price of ice cream so we could also basically change this
3:29:02
now i can go into data and i can go into data analysis
3:29:08
descriptive statistics so we know that we had selected this b2 to b8
3:29:14
and this one which is h6 to h19 we would want to shift it
3:29:20
might be two columns up so might be i can just say h5 and i can manually change it to at 17
3:29:28
and let's say okay and we will basically get this
3:29:34
and i can get rid of this so i can have it in the same range
3:29:40
so similarly so this one will have to be renamed and i can basically say price of
3:29:46
ice cream and that's basically my descriptive statistics for
3:29:52
my price of ice cream and similarly we can do it for the third
3:29:59
column which is units sold so we would want to have this now let's see we can
3:30:06
click on data we can click on data analysis descriptive statistics so we need to
3:30:13
give the range correctly so this time our range changes to units sold
3:30:18
now we can also say labels in first row okay if
3:30:23
we were selecting the heading so let's do it in this way so in my range in my
3:30:30
range let me empty this i can basically select this which we
3:30:36
know has non-numeric data in the first row say for example i'll say labels in first
3:30:42
row i'm interested in summary statistics and this range will now have to be
3:30:48
changed from h to basically something like
3:30:53
j so let's say j and let's select these values so that
3:30:59
should take care of things and now you see you have your units sold you did not
3:31:05
have to manually rename it and you have basically got the descriptive statistics so this is how
3:31:11
you can simply perform analysis using data analysis here
3:31:16
you can basically get your descriptive statistics for your columns and then you can do whatever needed formatting you
3:31:23
need to basically make your data look in a
3:31:29
good way now let's look at one more example of data analysis
3:31:35
where we may want to look at the frequency of values or frequency of
3:31:40
values occurring in a range of values so for example if you have been given temperatures you have been given some
3:31:48
pins where you would want to identify how many values fall into the range of 0
3:31:54
to 20 20 to 30 30 to 40 40 to 50 and the
3:32:00
easiest way to do that would be creating histogram now histogram is usually used for data analysis where you would want
3:32:07
to look at different variables or say features for example temperature is one such feature might be there might be one
3:32:14
more variable or feature such as sale of ice cream and you would want to see
3:32:20
if the increase or decrease in temperature affects the increase or decrease in
3:32:26
sale of ice cream might be sale of ice cream is a is a response based on
3:32:31
temperature so it depends so sometimes you may want to find a relationship between two variables whether they are
3:32:39
positively or negatively related or you would want to do different kind of analysis and in certain cases we may
3:32:46
want to first do analysis on one single variable
3:32:51
look at the frequency of values might be also look at the defects and for which
3:32:56
we can use something like pareto chart so we can go for histogram and that
3:33:02
basically gives us the frequency of values now how do we do that so we have already added the
3:33:10
add-in which is data analysis earlier so we can just use the same thing again
3:33:15
here we would want to create a histogram so let's say ok now i have already selected input range so
3:33:22
if you see here my input range is temperature which is also with the headings
3:33:28
and i have bin range which is basically the range of values so for example i can
3:33:35
select this and that's my bin range i am selecting or the option labels because i'm using
3:33:42
the first row which has the heading such as temperature and bins now we need to give
3:33:49
a output range so for example let's say i would want my data here
3:33:54
and that becomes my output range so you can have a sorted histogram or basically
3:34:00
a pareto chart so if that's what you are interested in looking at the frequencies for your
3:34:06
different ranges and here i am also selecting chart output because i would
3:34:12
want to have a visual histogram which gives us the frequency and it's as
3:34:17
simple as this just click on ok and now you get your bins
3:34:22
so it basically tells you frequency of values which is basically 20 but that does not mean it
3:34:28
is only talking about the value is 20 it is basically talking as a range of 0 to
3:34:34
20 so we have 0 to 20 that is 2 so we can basically say there is 120 here with the
3:34:41
20 being the maximum value and then there is one more 20 so that's your 0 to 20 then you have 20 to 30 which shows
3:34:49
three values so might be in that case i can say 26
3:34:54
is one thing then i can say 30 that's the second one
3:35:00
and then basically i can look at 22 so basically this one does not select 20 as
3:35:06
the lower range but it basically selects 30 as the higher range so i do see 20 to
3:35:12
30 there are three entries similarly we can see values for 40 and 50 and since
3:35:18
we have selected pareto or sorted histogram that shows in a descending order what is the highest frequency of
3:35:27
values within a particular range so that shows me highest frequency is
3:35:32
five and then you have three and three and then 2. so this is how we can create
3:35:39
a histogram and we can perform analysis on a single variable
3:35:45
now as discussed earlier as i said sometimes we may
3:35:51
be interested in finding out the correlation between different variables such as say here we have temperature
3:35:58
price of ice cream and units sold and we may want to find out the correlation between
3:36:05
one variable to another variable or we would want to find out the relationship
3:36:11
between variables are they linearly related are they positively related negatively related
3:36:17
and so on and for that we can use the correlation of your data analysis add-in so for
3:36:24
example you want to find out correlation of temperature and units sold and what
3:36:30
we can do is we can find out that using a formula so for example if i search for something
3:36:36
like co relation and let's search so there is a function
3:36:42
called correlation which we can use and we can use this to calculate the correlation of temperature and units
3:36:49
sold so for example let's select this and that's the function so it says give
3:36:54
me an first array and a second array so we are interested in finding out correlation of temperature in units sold
3:37:02
so let's select the range of values for temperature and then i am interested in finding out the
3:37:08
correlation of temperature in units sold so let's select this and that basically gives me a range of
3:37:15
values it gives me the correlation value which is 0.2859
3:37:20
say ok and that's your value so similarly we can do it for temperature and price ice cream so let's
3:37:28
go for correlation so that's the function we are interested in you need to give a
3:37:35
range of value so here we are interested in temperature and price of ice cream so let's select temperature
3:37:41
and then the second array or list of values is price of ice cream let's select that
3:37:47
let's close our bracket and here we have the correlation value of temperature and
3:37:53
the price of ice cream similarly you may be interested in finding out temperature
3:37:59
and units sold like what we have done earlier so we can do the same thing based on
3:38:05
function so this is same as correlation of temperature in units sold so i can get rid of this one now how do
3:38:13
i do it using the data analysis add in so for that what we need is we need to
3:38:19
go into data we need to click on data analysis and here you have the option
3:38:25
called correlation let's select this now that basically needs an input range so
3:38:31
we need the range now i might be interested in finding out the correlation between temperature and
3:38:38
price of ice cream and units sold so i've selected all the columns here
3:38:44
we will say group by columns obviously we need to select labels in first row
3:38:49
because that is basically taking care of the first row is heading now output range you can just give one simple cell
3:38:57
and that's where your data will start from or you can give a new workbook so click on ok
3:39:03
and that basically gives you that basically gives your
3:39:10
correlation of your different variables and what are the values and we can check
3:39:15
these values based on the values what we have here so we have basically temperature
3:39:23
and price of ice cream and that basically shows me 0.96149
3:39:30
you have temperature and units sold so you have 0.2859
3:39:35
now you can also look at units sold and say for example price of ice cream
3:39:41
you can look at these particular values so if i would be interested in finding
3:39:46
out what is the relationship between these variables i can easily find using
3:39:52
correlation so i could be basically writing in a formula here and
3:39:58
selecting what are the cells so here we were selecting a2 and c
3:40:05
here we were selecting a and b now might be i'm interested in price of ice cream
3:40:11
and units sold and if that's what i'm interested in then i will give a range of b2 to b8 c2 to c8 and similarly you
3:40:20
can get your analysis or correlation values so it's very simple in excel and you can
3:40:27
use either the data analysis tab and get your correlation or you can use
3:40:35
formulas and do that now one more important part of data analysis is doing your sampling now
3:40:42
sampling could be periodic sampling or random sampling so sometimes you may
3:40:47
want to look at a variable and you may want to get some values based on periodic data
3:40:55
that means might be i'm interested in range of values i'm interested in seeing a sample
3:41:01
of values for a particular period which could be basically
3:41:09
a range of values or you could just do a random sampling so for example if i go for periodic sampling so out of these
3:41:17
values which i see here might be i want to see say periodic sampling that is a
3:41:24
frequency of two values how many times we have these values occurring here or i
3:41:31
would go for random sampling so basically randomly i would want to pick up
3:41:36
say three temperature values now how do i do it so for example here i have seven
3:41:42
values now if i go for periodic sampling the sample
3:41:49
or periodic sample value which i need to give has to be lesser than the total
3:41:55
input values so for example we can do this let's go
3:42:00
in here and let's go for data analysis so we can go for sampling here click on ok and
3:42:07
that needs a range of values so we will select a2 to a8 now i could have
3:42:13
selected all the values for this one temperature and in that case i can give
3:42:18
labels which is going to take care of the first row
3:42:23
now here we can go for number of samples which we are interested in or giving a period so
3:42:31
let's go for period and say for example i have seven values so what if i select
3:42:36
five so for example if i say five that means i could just get one value
3:42:44
so basically when i'm saying five out of seven so that's just giving me out of
3:42:50
five i want one value so i can then just give an output range so here i can
3:42:57
basically select this cell i'll say okay and now you see it just shows me
3:43:04
one value so out of the first range that is i have said five it has given me the fifth
3:43:11
value that's your periodic sampling so for example we want more values so let's
3:43:17
reduce this period to might be 2 which basically gives me
3:43:22
every second value so i can basically say for example 2 and say ok
3:43:29
and then say ok so that shows me 26
3:43:34
then you have 35 then you have 40 and then well this one
3:43:39
does not have any more value so that's your periodic sampling now if you go for random sampling that's basically
3:43:46
randomly picking up values and you can choose how many values you want so go for data analysis go for sampling i'll
3:43:54
go for number of samples how many you want so for example out of seven values
3:44:00
randomly i want three values and i can just give this say okay
3:44:06
and then we will do a cancel because we need to change that range so let's select this
3:44:12
and say okay and that gives me random three values from this
3:44:17
values of temperature so we can use excel to do a simple sampling and we can
3:44:23
choose whether we would want to go for periodic sampling or random sampling let's continue learning
3:44:31
excel and how excel can be used for data analysis now we have seen
3:44:37
sampling histogram correlation descriptive stats and now also let's
3:44:43
look at regression now what is regression so when you talk about statistical modeling regression analysis
3:44:50
is used to estimate the relationship between two or more variables and basically we
3:44:56
would want to look at two or more variables and basically a relationship of those
3:45:04
variables with the response or the target right so for example if we look
3:45:09
at our data here we have temperature we have price of ice cream and then we have
3:45:14
units sold and we can go ahead and make predictions so for example when you look at regression here
3:45:22
you see something like this which is regression statistics you have anova
3:45:28
you have different plots which we have here which is x variable
3:45:33
x variable 2 and then you have normal probability plot now we have already seen how you can
3:45:40
have your add-in that is data analysis which helps you in doing different kind of data analysis here right now how do
3:45:48
we do this so we have our variables here which is temperature price of ice cream
3:45:54
units sold and when we talk about regression we need to understand which one of these are
3:46:00
independent variables which one of these are dependent variables right so when you talk about your x
3:46:07
and that's your independent variable or we can say predictor or explanatory
3:46:12
so when you talk about your independent variables or as we say predictors
3:46:18
or explanatory variables these are the factors that
3:46:23
might influence the dependent variable and when you talk about dependent
3:46:28
variable that's your response or target that's the main factor you're trying to understand or predict so we can
3:46:36
plot a scatter plot to see relationship between variables if they are linearly related are they
3:46:43
positively related negatively related and so on we can also
3:46:48
get values such as r square which is coefficient of determination
3:46:53
regression line and then analyze the relationship between variables so
3:46:59
here is one of the links of one of my edit other videos where we are
3:47:04
learning on machine learning and also on regression but that's programmatically
3:47:10
and using a processing framework such as spark now here let's see how do we do this in
3:47:16
excel so basically we would want to use our variables which is temperature price of ice cream units sold
3:47:23
and then get these plots so what we can do is for example i can get rid of this
3:47:30
and might be i can just say no borders and
3:47:35
when it comes to these plots we can have them generated again that's
3:47:40
not a big deal using your data analysis add-in tool so we have been given variables here now
3:47:48
as i said when we talk about your regression analysis we need to
3:47:54
understand whether we have one variable or we have multiple variables right so you might
3:48:00
have heard of univariate analysis bivariate analysis and so on well
3:48:06
here we are focusing more on using excel to do our regression analysis so i will
3:48:12
not go deeper into regression topics but certain things as basics should be known that when we
3:48:20
talk about regression analysis what does it do it helps you understand how the dependent variable changes when
3:48:28
one or more independent variables vary and
3:48:34
it basically allows us to mathematically determine which of those variables
3:48:39
really has an impact so technically when we talk about regression analysis model
3:48:46
that is based on the sum of squares which is basically a mathematical way to find the
3:48:52
dispersion of data points so mainly the goal of the model is to get
3:48:59
the smallest possible sum of squares and draw a line that comes closest to the
3:49:04
data so that's what we mean by our regression line or basically looking at
3:49:10
the points and seeing if the points fall on a regression line if there are residuals
3:49:16
that is points which do not fall on the regression line and in terms of
3:49:21
statistics when we talk about statistics we differentiate between a
3:49:27
simple and multiple linear regression so you have something called a simple linear regression
3:49:32
models which basically gives you the relationship between dependent variable
3:49:38
and one independent variable using a linear function and if you use two or more variables that is explanatory
3:49:45
variables to predict the dependent variable we are actually dealing with multiple linear regression so if the
3:49:52
dependent variable is modeled as a non-linear function because the data relationships do not
3:49:59
follow a straight line we have to use non-linear regression
3:50:05
now what we will do is we'll see how we can work on this so here we have some variables and if we look at this
3:50:12
might be based on temperature price of ice cream we would want to find out how many units
3:50:18
were sold now what we can do is we can basically
3:50:23
start looking in by creating a simple scatter plot which is quite easy in
3:50:28
excel so if you have been given variables what you can do is you can click on insert you can then choose the kind of plots
3:50:36
which you want and here you have insert scatter plot so we can choose this and you can choose the first option
3:50:43
so that gives you a blank layout and what you can do is now you need to select data so for example let's click
3:50:50
on select data and then you can say add so what we would want is we can give a
3:50:56
name so we want x values and we want our y values right so when you talk about y
3:51:04
that's your dependent variable or your response or target so that is in our case units sold and x values are one
3:51:13
set of features or variables or multiple variables so here i can click on this
3:51:18
series x values and then i can select this now in y values what i can do is
3:51:26
i can select these and then i can just say okay so that shows me that it would be giving
3:51:33
me a regression scatter plot now let's say okay
3:51:38
and we have some points plotted here now if you would want to see the impact of
3:51:44
one individual variable such as temperature or price of ice cream you could as well do that now what you can
3:51:51
also do is you can add more meaning to this by giving in a title or you can also go
3:51:58
into quick layout and you have various options here so you see it gives you
3:52:03
what is the access title what is the series and i would prefer to use
3:52:09
here something like this one so that gives you your regression line that also gives
3:52:15
you your r square and that gives you your y and x that is your coefficients
3:52:21
so let's select this one and then we have some values which we can use to
3:52:26
compare this also shows me the regression line and you can keep this for reference if you would want you can
3:52:33
change the chart title to something else a scatter plot
3:52:39
of dependent was independent
3:52:47
variables and you can give any name which has more meaning and we can get rid of this one so we have
3:52:54
series and we can say what are these points if you would want to add in legend if you would want to do that or i
3:53:01
can just get rid of this and i will keep these values here which we
3:53:07
will see when we do a data analysis we can always compare these values so here i have
3:53:14
created a simple scatter plot and then i can look at dependent ways independent
3:53:20
variables or i could have selected one particular variable so this is just for reference now we can add more details we
3:53:29
can say what is my x-axis what is my y-axis so basically you can here
3:53:36
say for example just say y and might be here i will say
3:53:42
x and we can rename that later now how do we perform data analysis or get
3:53:49
into regression right now what we would want to do is
3:53:54
we would want to get or we would want to do the regression analysis to demonstrate the relationship
3:54:01
between dependent on independent variables so normally when you talk
3:54:06
about your linear regression equation you might have known about it so it is basically y
3:54:13
when you say y equals you can say
3:54:18
bx plus a plus c and this would be normally the
3:54:26
mathematical equation for a linear regression where x
3:54:31
is your independent variable y is your dependent variable
3:54:37
your a is the y-intercept
3:54:42
which is expected mean value of y when all x variables are equal to zero
3:54:49
so basically on a regression graph that's the point where line crosses the y axis and that's your intercept
3:54:56
when you talk about b that's basically your slope of regression line which is
3:55:02
the rate of change for y as x changes and then you also have
3:55:09
your constant right so that's your uh sorry that's basically your random error term right which is basically the
3:55:18
difference between the actual value of dependent variable and its predicted value so your
3:55:24
linear equation always has an error term because in real life predictors are obviously never
3:55:32
perfectly precise right now what we can do is we can also reduce this
3:55:38
equation to y is b x plus a
3:55:44
and that's the equation of a line we can look into this and the linear equation
3:55:49
can be understood mathematically in this way now how do we do it in excel so what we can simply do is
3:55:55
[Music] here let me [Music]
3:56:01
yeah so we need to get into data and then here
3:56:06
we have our data analysis add in you can click on this one and from these
3:56:12
different options you can choose regression so that's what we would want to do now
3:56:18
we'll say okay now here you need to give your input y range so as i said you will
3:56:23
have to select the dependent and independent variables right so we would want to do some
3:56:29
regression analysis here and here we have your x and y
3:56:35
so y being your target that's basically your unit sold so we can select this
3:56:42
along with the labels when it comes to x either you can select one variable or
3:56:47
multiple variables so i will select temperature price of ice cream and then since we have chosen the
3:56:54
headings we will go for labels right now we can always look at the confidence
3:57:01
level we can change that so you can say whether you want it in a new worksheet or you can just say output
3:57:08
range and i will probably just click here and select one of the
3:57:13
cell here now we can also choose the other options which we would want to see as a part of
3:57:20
this regression analysis so basically we have selected input y range which is your dependent variable
3:57:28
you have selected x range which is your independent variable and if we are
3:57:33
building a multi regression model then we have chosen temperature and price of ice
3:57:40
cream both now we can choose the labels which we have done we can choose your output
3:57:45
range which is basically on this sheet and then we can select the residuals
3:57:51
so that basically gives you your residuals now we can also get your line fit plots which you were seeing
3:57:57
earlier you can also go for your normal probability plots and then basically
3:58:03
just say okay and let's say okay and that basically gives you
3:58:10
your regression analysis output so we basically have your summary output
3:58:18
we also have anova we have our serial output that's from the previous one
3:58:24
and basically we can get rid of this that's not required
3:58:29
i can get rid of this one yeah so now we have our regression
3:58:35
statistics we also have our plots so we can basically look into
3:58:41
these so we have our normal
3:58:49
let's get rid of these let's get rid of this let's get rid of this
3:58:55
and then what we can do is since we had some existing data
3:59:01
it has overwritten so let me get rid of this and i'll repeat this step again
3:59:06
and let's say what if yeah so now what we want to do is we want to
3:59:12
do a reaction analysis so we go get into data we get into data analysis we choose regression
3:59:20
we have already chosen our y range which is column c x range multiple variables we have gone
3:59:27
for labels output range which we would want to select a particular cell
3:59:33
so let me select this i am going for residuals line fit plots normal probability plots and say okay
3:59:42
so now we have our plots
3:59:47
we can just separate them to have a better understanding
3:59:58
yeah and that basically shows you the variables so here it shows me units sold
4:00:04
and then what are the predicted units sold and here the variable is temperature here the variable is price
4:00:11
of ice cream right so that's your one variable and second variable and then you also have your normal probability
4:00:17
plot now to interpret this or to understand what we have here where
4:00:23
we look at your summary output so it is good to understand what excel is helping us out
4:00:31
so basically when we do a regression in excel it is performing all the
4:00:36
calculations automatically the interpretation is something which we need to understand so basically we are
4:00:42
looking at multiple r value here and we can
4:00:48
let's also fine tune this one yeah we have our values here and if you see
4:00:55
we have our r square now we can then basically look at
4:01:01
our multiple r so what is your multiple r that's your correlation coefficient
4:01:07
which basically measures the strength of linear relationship between two variables so
4:01:13
[Music] this can be any value between your when you talk about your correlation
4:01:18
coefficient it can be any value between -1 and 1 and its absolute value indicates the
4:01:25
relationship strength so the larger the absolute value the
4:01:31
stronger the relationship so 1 basically means a strong positive relationship minus 1 means a strong negative
4:01:38
relationship and 0 means no relationship at all now when you are looking at r square
4:01:43
that is the coefficient of determination which is used as an indicator of the
4:01:50
goodness of the fit so it basically shows how many points fall on the regression line
4:01:57
so your r square value is basically calculated from the total sum of squares
4:02:03
when we say precisely it is the sum of squared deviations of the original data
4:02:09
from the mean now when we talk about looking at the value of your r square so
4:02:16
it is basically we can be seeing that this is
4:02:22
0.450788 that's the value which i am talking
4:02:27
about so it basically means 45 of our values fit the regression
4:02:33
analysis model so in other words 45 percent of dependent variables that
4:02:39
is your y values are explained by the independent variables that is your x values
4:02:45
so normally if you have r squared value higher then that is considered as a good
4:02:51
fit and here we have considered multiple variables now when you talk about your adjusted r
4:02:57
square it is the r square adjusted for the number of independent variables
4:03:03
in the model so you would want to use this value instead of r square for
4:03:09
multiple regression analysis such as in our case
4:03:14
now you also have standard error so that's basically goodness of fit measure that basically
4:03:21
shows the precision of your regression analysis so the smaller the value the
4:03:26
more certain you can be about your regression equation so when when we talk about your r square
4:03:33
that represents the percentage of dependent variables variance
4:03:38
that is explained by the model and standard error is basically an absolute measure that shows the average
4:03:46
distance that the data points fall from the regression line so you will have to look back into regression
4:03:53
statistics terminologies to basically understand more of this and if you're already from data science background
4:03:59
that then you already know what i'm talking about we are just seeing how excel
4:04:05
easily helps us in doing these things now we can also look at observations here
4:04:12
which is basically the number of observations in our model which is 7. now when we talk about regression
4:04:19
analysis and if we look at analysis of variance that is your anova values here
4:04:25
so we basically see df you have ss ms f and significance f
4:04:33
now to understand these so basically what we are doing is or
4:04:38
what excel is doing is it splits the sum of squares into individual components
4:04:44
that give information about the levels of variability within your regression model so when you talk about your df
4:04:52
that's basically the number of degrees of freedom associated with the source of variance you have sum of squares that is
4:04:59
your ss so smaller the residual ss compared with the total ss
4:05:05
the better your model fits the data right now when you talk about ms that's
4:05:10
your mean square you have f is basically the f statistic
4:05:15
or you can say f test for the null hypothesis
4:05:20
basically it is used to test the overall significance of the model and then you finally have your
4:05:27
significance f which is the p value of f so
4:05:32
uh when we when we usually talk about seeing simple linear regression the in
4:05:38
anova part is not really used or it's rarely used
4:05:44
right but when we look at the significance f value that gives an idea
4:05:50
of how reliably or statistically significant our results
4:05:55
are so if significance f is less than 0.05
4:06:01
that's 5 percent our model is ok if it is greater than 0.05
4:06:08
we will have to better choose another independent variables
4:06:13
right now we can also look at the output of coefficients and that's what we would
4:06:19
want to look at so you basically have your intercept here so when you talk
4:06:24
about your intercept temperature price of ice cream so we know we are looking at our variables and
4:06:31
then we are also looking looking at our intercept which basically gives you
4:06:37
more details on your coefficients so the the main important thing when we talk
4:06:43
about regression analysis is basically your coefficients it basically enables you to build a linear
4:06:50
regression equation uh in the form of y equals bx plus a
4:06:56
which i explained earlier and then basically we can understand our
4:07:01
regression analysis output better now when we look at the residual output which we are seeing here
4:07:08
so that gives you your observations how many observations we have it shows what is the predicted units
4:07:15
sold and then it also gives you your residuals so we can compare the
4:07:21
estimated and actual number of sold umbrellas based on the observation so we
4:07:27
have 11.209 here and if you compare that's basically 12
4:07:32
the second one is 15 and here it is 13.5 you have and similarly you can compare
4:07:40
all the values of actual units sold and what our regression has predicted
4:07:46
so basically what we can do is we can compare these and we will see if there is any difference
4:07:53
or no right so obviously there will be or there would
4:07:59
be some difference because independent variables are never perfect predictors of your dependent
4:08:05
variables and the residuals basically help us in understanding how
4:08:11
far the actual values are from the predicted values
4:08:16
so that's what we see here in the residual section so for example when we look at this one
4:08:22
which is 11.209 and the actual is 12 we see what is the residual and how far
4:08:29
is the predicted value from the actual value so similarly we can also look at the
4:08:35
percentile values so that gives you your probability output and this is what we
4:08:40
have in our graphs so we have basically our variables we
4:08:46
are looking at our variables and also the units sold and the relationship between them we can basically
4:08:53
uh add in more details to this particular plot and you also have normal probability plot which is basically
4:09:00
getting your values from your probability output here so this is how you can perform a
4:09:07
simple regression analysis and now what you can do is you can as i said you can
4:09:15
basically be looking at your scatter plot you can be looking at your y and x
4:09:20
and your r square values right but remember what are the variables which you are selecting
4:09:26
and then you can compare these with basically the values what you see
4:09:32
here so remember here i've chosen my both set of variables
4:09:38
and you can choose one variable and then basically see what
4:09:43
is its impact on the response or on the target
4:09:48
so it's pretty simple here you can add more details to your scatter plot or
4:09:54
the plots what we have created or some people prefer to do it using
4:09:59
formulas so basically we have some statistical functions that can help you do linear
4:10:06
regression analysis such as you have linus you have slope you have intercept
4:10:13
you have correlation and so on so basically you can use these particular functions
4:10:20
and what you will have to do is you will have to basically
4:10:25
go in for a function if that's what you would want to do and then you can search
4:10:31
for functions and say for example i'll just say nest
4:10:36
and say go and here i have my function so if i would want to really use this
4:10:41
one i can do that what i will have to do is then select the variable so if you just say okay and
4:10:48
that basically says your known y's known x your constants your stats and
4:10:53
basically you can use the formula also but we are not covering that here might be in the later videos we can do that so
4:11:00
just try out and perform some regression analysis and try to look at your different
4:11:07
variables and try to interpret that so that basically gives you
4:11:12
an easier way of performing regression analysis using your data analysis add-in in excel
4:11:19
and that brings us to the end of this video in data analytics with excel i hope it was useful and informative if
