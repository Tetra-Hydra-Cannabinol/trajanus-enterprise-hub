==============================================================================

0:00 waffle charts are a popular way to
0:01 visually display parts to a ho and
0:04 they're a good alternative to fellow
0:05 pastry based charts like the pie and dut
0:09 particularly if you're wanting to
0:10 display small segments which often end
0:13 up as a tiny Slither in a pie or a donut
0:16 chart however that doesn't mean you
0:18 should get carried away with the number
0:20 of categories you display in Waffle
0:22 charts I still recommend no more than
0:25 three after that just becomes too
0:27 difficult to compare the parts now there
0:30 there are a couple of ways we can build
0:31 waffle charts in Excel and in this
0:33 example we'll look at conditional
0:34 formatting individual
0:36 cells we'll start with a waffle chart
0:39 that adds up to 100 or 100% using a 10x1
0:43 grid of cells this is also known as
0:46 relative waffle chart the US Senate data
0:49 I have here works well for this example
0:51 because there are 100 senators of course
0:53 it also works well for data that adds up
0:55 to 100% now each cell in the waffle
0:59 chart is numbered from 1 through to 100
1:01 counting up from the bottom left and
1:04 working left to right now I have
1:06 Microsoft 365 so I'm going to use the
1:08 sort and sequence Dynamic array
1:10 functions to generate the numbers but if
1:12 you don't have 365 I'm going to show you
1:15 an alternate formula in a moment so
1:17 equals sort
1:19 sequence I want 10 rows 10 columns I
1:23 want to start at one and count up by one
1:27 and I'm going to sort it I'm going to
1:30 skip the sort index argument but I want
1:32 the sort order to be minus one which is
1:36 descending and because I have Dynamic
1:38 arrays it spills the results to the
1:40 cells below and to the right you can see
1:42 it starts in the bottom left at one and
1:44 counts up to 100 now the alternate
1:48 formula if you don't have Dynamic arrays
1:50 is to use columns and rows so here we're
1:53 going to start in column
1:56 1 and we're going to go through to
1:59 column 10
2:00 notice my absolute
2:02 referencing + 10 * rows and here I want
2:08 starting at Row
2:10 one through to row
2:14 10 minus one close parentheses you can
2:18 see this has returned the same value
2:20 that I have in the top left cell of my
2:22 sort and sequence formula so all I need
2:24 to do now is copy it down 10 rows and
2:27 across 10 columns
2:30 and I get the same results so this is
2:33 the alternate formula if you don't have
2:35 Dynamic arrays let me just select those
2:37 cells and delete that and we'll work
2:40 with this data set the next thing I want
2:43 to do is resize The Columns and rows to
2:45 make each cell a small square so let's
2:49 select the columns right click column
2:52 width the column width is
2:53 one and the row height is going to be 10
3:01 now you can still see that I have
3:02 numbers in there I could hide them with
3:04 some font formatting or I could just
3:06 make the font really big and then it
3:08 can't display it anyway next I'll set
3:11 all the cells to have a gray fill color
3:14 and we'll give those cells a border
3:17 that's white so I'll just go into more
3:18 borders I prefer to do it this way I
3:21 want white and I want the outline and
3:24 inside to be
3:26 white and there's my 10x10 grid and I'm
3:29 ready to set the conditional formatting
3:31 rules so the first thing to do is select
3:33 all of the cells and then on the Home
3:35 tab of the ribbon conditional
3:38 formatting new rule and here I want use
3:41 a formula to determine which cells to
3:44 format so here I want to start with the
3:47 top left cell I'm going to remove the
3:50 absolute referencing by pressing F4
3:52 three times I want to check that this
3:55 cell value is less than or equal to the
3:59 democrat's value plus the Republicans
4:01 value I need to add Democrats to
4:04 Republicans because my Republicans
4:06 series is going to sh up second or on
4:09 top of the Democrats
4:10 values so this is the Republican value
4:14 so here I want the fill color to be
4:17 read and now all I need to do is repeat
4:20 that conditional formatting for the
4:23 Democrats which are blue again select
4:26 the first cell remove the absolute
4:28 referencing check that it's less than or
4:31 equal to the democrat's values set the
4:34 formatting fill to
4:38 blue and then we have a visual
4:41 representation of how many seats overall
4:44 are for women and the breakdown of those
4:46 seats between Democrats and Republicans
4:49 now if we look at the conditional
4:51 formatting manager you can see that the
4:53 order of the rules is blue is applied
4:56 first and then red if you don't have
4:59 your rules in the right order it's not
5:01 going to display correctly but you can
5:03 easily rearrange them using the up and
5:05 down arrows in the conditional
5:07 formatting rules manager so I'll click
5:10 okay and the last thing I want to do is
5:13 give my chart a label now because the
5:15 column widths up here are tiny I like to
5:19 use a text box so we'll go to the insert
5:21 tab shapes text box and you just draw in
5:26 the text box and type in your title
5:35 all and you can use color coding to help
5:38 your reader interpret the
5:39 [Music]
5:41 chart it also means you don't need to
5:44 have a legend let's remove the border
5:47 from the text box so we're going to
5:49 shape outline no outline now normally
5:52 you'd have all these workings on another
5:54 sheet I've kept them here just so that
5:56 we can see it in context as I'm building
5:59 building the waffle chart just move that
6:02 into
6:07 place absolute waffle charts don't
6:10 necessarily add up to 100 instead each
6:13 square or dot in the chart represents
6:15 one unit with the total number of
6:17 squares or dots adding up to the total
6:19 data for example there are 435 people
6:23 who make up the United States House of
6:25 Representatives and I want to create a
6:27 waffle chart that has a segment for each
6:30 person so let's go back to the working
6:32 file for the video here I've already
6:35 sized the column width and row height to
6:38 suit my
6:39 needs again I need to number each cell
6:42 and I can use sort and sequence to do
6:45 that here I want 20 rows and the number
6:49 of columns could vary based on my data
6:52 and one way to calculate that is to use
6:54 Round Up to take the total number and
6:58 divide it by say the same number of rows
7:01 that you have doesn't necessarily mean
7:02 it will come out as a square and as
7:04 you'll see in this case I want to round
7:07 it to zero decimal places and for the
7:11 sequence I want to start at one and step
7:13 by one again we're going to skip the
7:15 sort index and sort in descending
7:19 order so the data has spilled you can't
7:22 see the numbers because the font is too
7:25 big to see in the cells but if we
7:28 enlarge them for a moment you can see
7:32 I've got 440 numbers and they start at
7:35 one now obviously I only need 435 so
7:39 these ones are redundant and we'll hide
7:41 them with conditional formatting I'm
7:43 just going to contrl zed to undo that so
7:46 that my numbers are hidden again now the
7:48 rules here are slightly different
7:49 because remember I only want to
7:51 highlight or shade 435 of the cells so
7:55 I'm going to use conditional formatting
7:57 for the gray fill color as well so again
8:00 we want a new rule using a formula so
8:03 this is where the first cell remove the
8:06 absolute referencing is less than or
8:08 equal to a total
8:11 number we want to format these cells
8:13 with a gray fill color with a white
8:19 border click okay and okay and there I
8:23 have my 435 segments now I can apply the
8:27 conditional formatting for the red and
8:29 blue again we're going to display the
8:31 Democrats at the bottom and then the
8:33 Republicans next so we'll start with
8:36 Republicans new rule based on a formula
8:40 again where this cell remove the
8:42 absolute reference is less than or equal
8:45 to Democrats plus Republicans we want
8:48 the format fill to be
8:52 red and let's repeat for the
8:57 blue remove the absolute
9:00 referencing is less than or equal to the
9:02 number of Democrats we want to format it
9:05 in
9:06 blue now this example uses the sort and
9:09 sequence Dynamic array functions but you
9:12 can also build this using the columns
9:13 and row functions so similar to before
9:16 we want to start in A1 through to A1 for
9:21 the first cell and you can see I haven't
9:23 made the second reference to A1 absolute
9:26 that's important so that when we copy it
9:28 it increment correctly now I've got 22
9:31 columns times
9:33 rows and again starting in Row 1 through
9:38 to
9:39 a20 -1 close
9:42 parentheses now let's copy this formula
9:45 because it's not a dynamic array it
9:47 doesn't spill and if I make the columns
9:50 wider you can see the numbers so there's
9:52 my 440 values generated using columns
9:56 and rows that's for earlier versions of
9:58 excel C now another option we have
10:01 instead of showing the squares is to
10:03 show a symbol like a DOT and we can grab
10:06 one of those from the insert tab symbol
10:10 and in the dialog box here I've got a
10:12 DOT that I've used before there are
10:14 other shapes and symbols that you could
10:16 use you can scroll through and have a
10:18 look what's available I'm going to stick
10:20 with the dot so I'll click close with it
10:22 selected crl C to copy and then escape
10:26 cuz I don't actually want it in that
10:27 cell so here I can use an if formula to
10:31 test if this value is less than or equal
10:34 to this value F4 to Absolute if it is
10:38 return the dot otherwise return blank
10:42 close my if so you can see it's returned
10:44 a DOT now all I need to do is copy and
10:47 paste that to the remaining cells you
10:50 can see these cells are the values that
10:53 are greater than 435 so they don't get a
10:56 DOT and because the DOT is essentially a
11:00 font I can use the font color to format
11:03 it in a shade of gray now the
11:06 conditional formatting is slightly more
11:07 complex but first let's just resize the
11:10 column
11:12 widths back to
11:14 one and what I want to do is copy the
11:17 formula in here for columns and rows
11:20 this formula returns a number remember
11:22 if I press F9 you can see this cell is
11:25 value 419 so I want to copy that formula
11:29 and then select all of my cells that I
11:31 want to conditionally format and again
11:34 we're going to apply a new rule based on
11:36 a formula and here I need to paste in
11:39 that formula that I copied that's going
11:42 to give me the value to compare to check
11:44 whether it's less than or equal to so
11:47 the first format is for red so we want
11:50 to check that it's less than or equal to
11:52 Democrats plus Republicans vales if it
11:56 is I want to format the font remember
11:58 the dot is a font and I want it to be
12:02 red click okay and okay so there we have
12:06 the Republicans formatted let's repeat
12:09 for the Democrats again equals paste in
12:12 the formula less than or equals 2 the
12:16 Democrats
12:17 figure and this one the format font
12:20 color is
12:22 blue and lastly because my column widths
12:26 are tiny I'm going to insert a 10 text
12:29 box for the chart
12:37 title and like before let's use some
12:41 color coding to help our readers
12:43 interpret the chart without the need of
12:46 a
12:49 legend make this font
12:51 [Music]
12:54 gray and
12:56 bold then you can resize it
12:59 let's remove the
13:01 border and the title is the same for
13:04 both so just holding down control and
13:06 shift I'm left clicking and dragging to
13:08 make a copy of that chart
13:11 [Music]
13:13 title in these examples you'll have
13:16 noticed that each segment represents a
13:18 whole number or a whole percentage point
13:21 with this technique it's not possible to
13:23 show fractions of a percentage point but
13:26 in next week's video I'll demonstrate an
13:28 alternate way to Bell waffle charts that
13:30 get around this limitation well I hope
13:33 you found this technique useful you can
13:36 download the Excel file for this lesson
