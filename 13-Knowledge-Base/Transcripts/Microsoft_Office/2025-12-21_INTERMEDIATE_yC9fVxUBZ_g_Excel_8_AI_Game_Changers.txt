==============================================================================

0:00 Excel has a load of AI tools already built in
0:03 that we can use to improve productivity
0:05 and make our lives easier.
0:07 There are AI tools that will clean data
0:10 analyze it for you,
0:12 create automatic forecasts
0:14 and even write custom lambda functions,
0:17 and that's all before copilot gets added.
0:20 Ah! I told you, not yet.
0:23 Sorry. Bit keen!
0:25 Plus I'm going to show you a tool that is
0:27 so new it's still in development,
0:29 so stay tuned to the end.
0:31 Let's start with the data cleaning tools.
0:33 Here I have a list of names that I want to split
0:36 into separate columns.
0:37 With flash fill,
0:38 I can simply give it an example or 2,
0:40 and Excel will give me a preview of what it thinks
0:43 I need. All I need to do is press Enter to accept it.
0:47 The only catch is I have to do one column at a time,
0:50 but in the scheme of things that's no big deal.
0:53 If you have some inconsistent data,
0:55 you can give an example of the different permutations
0:59 and then trigger Flash Fill
1:00 using the keyboard shortcut CTRL+E
1:03 Pretty cool and you can see here.
1:06 Flash Fill also works with dates.
1:08 There are a
1:09 load more examples in my comprehensive Flash Fill
1:12 video here. Now
1:13 the downside of Flash Fill
1:14 is that if your data changes
1:16 you have to manually trigger the Flash Fill again.
1:19 So if you expect your data to update
1:21 then Power Query's column from example
1:24 is going to be more efficient. Here I've
1:26 got a table
1:26 where the name and position are concatenated
1:29 in one column,
1:29 which is a big no no.
1:31 Let's go ahead and load the data to Power Query.
1:33 It's already in a table,
1:34 so all I need to do is go to the data tab and load it
1:38 from table range.
1:40 I want to add a column that extracts the position
1:42 so I'm going to go to the add column tab
1:44 and then column from examples,
1:46 and all I need to do is give it an example
1:48 of the result that I want,
1:50 and just like that, it's detected the pattern.
1:53 In this case it is pretty easy because it is
1:55 already comma separated
1:57 in the name and position column,
1:58 but what's really cool
1:59 is that it's showing me the formula
2:01 that it's going to use.
2:02 All I need to do here is click okay
2:05 and it adds the column for me.
2:07 Let's rename it and I'm good to close and load
2:09 so we'll go close and load to
2:13 we'll put it on this worksheet.
2:15 I'll just pop it over here
2:17 and there's my data in the correct format.
2:20 Now the beauty of this is
2:22 if I add a record to my source data,
2:25 all I need to do is right-click my query table
2:27 and refresh
2:29 and boom, there's my record.
2:31 All right, all right.
2:32 That was an easy example.
2:33 Let's look at something harder.
2:36 Here I have a table of meeting rooms
2:37 and when they're booked. I'd.
2:39 like to count the number of days each room is booked.
2:42 Let's load the data to power query.
2:45 Remember here
2:45 I want to count the number of days
2:47 the meeting rooms are booked.
2:49 Meeting room one is booked 2 days this week
2:53 and meeting room 2 is booked one day
2:56 so we're going to have to give this a few examples.
2:59 It thinks it's detected a pattern,
3:00 but we can see meeting room 3 is booked every day,
3:03 so let's fix that
3:06 and it's correctly detected the rest.
3:08 But what's really cool
3:10 is it's written the formula for me
3:12 and we can see here
3:13 it's using the List.NonNullCount function.
3:16 I didn't even need to know about that function.
3:19 All I need to do now is click ok,
3:21 It's added my count column
3:22 and put the formula in for me.
3:25 All I need to do now is close & load to.
3:30 We'll put this on the same worksheet
3:31 and I'll just pop it
3:32 one column to the right of my table
3:34 so it's out of the way.
3:36 So there are just a couple of examples
3:38 but Power Query can work with all sorts of data
3:41 including dates,
3:42 time, arithmetic and more,
3:45 so be sure to give it a go
3:46 next time you're
3:47 adding columns or cleaning data in Power Query.
3:51 If you're not sure how to analyze your data
3:53 or you're new to pivot tables,
3:55 then recommended pivot tables,
3:56 will analyze your data and make some
3:59 suggestions. Just point and click!
4:02 Simply select a cell in the table
4:04 and then on the insert tab
4:06 you want recommended pivot tables.
4:08 It opens up in a pane on the right hand side.
4:11 I'm just going to left click and drag it out
4:13 and bring it closer to my data.
4:15 Excel analyzes your data for you
4:17 and identifies
4:18 possible ways you might want to summarize it.
4:20 Click on the insert buttons,
4:22 either new sheet or existing sheet
4:24 at the bottom of each suggested pivot table.
4:28 You can see there's 10 altogether.
4:29 I can click on this to show all 10 results.
4:33 Let's choose a pivot table,
4:35 I'll put it on an existing sheet
4:38 and just here beside my data
4:42 and now I can work with this
4:43 just like any other pivot table,
4:45 changing the formatting. For example,
4:47 let's get rid of the decimal places.
4:50 I can add more fields if I want,
4:52 you can see it works just like a regular pivot table
4:54 because it is.
4:56 I just haven't had to do all the work of
4:57 building it from scratch,
4:59 and if I want more recommended pivot tables,
5:01 I can just continue scrolling through
5:03 and choose the next one.
5:06 Similarly recommended charts
5:08 make suggestions based on your data.
5:10 You'll find it on the insert tab
5:11 and then recommended charts.
5:14 It can suggest regular charts or pivot charts
5:17 it just depends on the data.
5:19 Selecting a chart on the left gives you a preview
5:22 on the right.
5:23 and when you've chosen the one you want, simply click ok,
5:27 and now I can work with this like any old chart.
5:29 For example, let's say
5:31 I want to get rid of my horizontal axis,
5:34 add data labels, and I'll get rid of the grid lines.
5:37 Job done.
5:39 Analyze Data is an
5:40 AI powered service that automatically
5:42 identifies patterns,
5:43 correlations and outliers in your data
5:46 and provides you with charts and pivot tables
5:48 you can insert into your workbook.
5:51 And because it's powered by machine learning,
5:54 it will provide increasingly
5:56 advanced analysis as usage grows.
5:59 So try it out.
6:00 I like to use Analyze Data
6:02 when I receive a new data set
6:03 that I'm not familiar with.
6:05 Ideally your data should be in a tabular layout
6:08 and formatted in an Excel table
6:10 like I have here
6:11 the more category type columns in your data set,
6:14 the more opportunities Excel has to group the data
6:17 and find interesting correlations,
6:19 trends and patterns.
6:21 You'll find analyze data on the home tab of the ribbon
6:24 and over on the far right.
6:26 It opens in a task pane and you can left
6:28 click and drag to pull it out closer to your data.
6:31 The first suggestion is a pivot table.
6:34 I can go ahead and insert it.
6:36 I've also got some charts. It looks for trends, patterns,
6:40 outliers and correlations.
6:43 There's some more results here. Let's expand that.
6:48 Once you choose the chart you want,
6:50 go ahead and insert it and
6:51 then you can just work with it like any other chart.
6:55 If you don't like the one you've chosen,
6:56 simply click on it and press Delete.
7:00 Now, one of the cool things about analyze data is
7:03 you can also ask a question using natural language.
7:06 For example, let's say
7:08 I want to display the total visitors by destination
7:12 as a column chart.
7:14 It's going to generate a pivot chart
7:15 that looks pretty good.
7:16 I'll
7:17 insert pivot chart
7:19 we can see here.
7:19 It's inserted a new sheet that contains my pivot table
7:23 and the pivot chart.
7:25 Excel Forecast Sheets automatically
7:27 generate formulas to predict
7:29 the future values
7:30 and present the results in a nice chart for you.
7:33 They require historical
7:34 time based data in a tabular layout
7:36 that contains a column with dates
7:38 or times at consistent intervals
7:40 and a column for the values.
7:43 Creating a forecast is super easy.
7:45 Go to the data tab
7:47 and then forecast sheet
7:51 at the dialogue box,
7:52 here you can set the confidence intervals,
7:54 seasonality, and various other things.
7:57 I'll leave them at the defaults.
7:59 You can experiment with them yourself,
8:01 I'll click create, it
8:02 inserts a new sheet in the file
8:03 containing a copy of your data,
8:05 the formulas and a chart. Pretty easy, huh?
8:09 For a comprehensive video on forecast sheets,
8:11 check out this one.
8:13 Excel Labs,
8:14 formerly called the Advanced Formula Environment,
8:17 can convert formulas to
8:18 custom lambda functions from examples
8:21 in the grid. Here in columns C to E, I have.
8:24 3 separate formulas
8:26 to extract the product code from column B.
8:29 I want to convert these formulas into a lambda function
8:32 that I can use again and again
8:33 so I don't have to remember how to write these long
8:36 complicated formulas.
8:38 If you haven't already got Excel Labs installed,
8:40 you can do so via the Home tab and then Add ins.
8:45 Click on Get Add Ins to search for it
8:48 here, type in Excel Labs
8:50 and press Enter. There it is.
8:53 I'll close that down because I've already installed it.
8:56 It appears on your Home tab,
8:57 so click on Excel Labs
9:00 the first time you use it
9:01 you have to choose it from the Excel Labs pane,
9:04 but you can choose.
9:06 Remember this choice
9:06 so next time it goes straight to it.
9:09 I'll go ahead and open it.
9:11 Let's left click and drag it out
9:13 so it's closer to the formula
9:15 to create a custom function using Excel Labs.
9:18 Go to the names tab
9:19 and then click on the icon of the grid with the
9:21 little plus sign.
9:23 We're going to add a function from grid.
9:25 The range containing the calculation
9:27 are the 3 cells that have my formulas,
9:30 the cells to treat as parameters. That's cell B5
9:33 which is the cell containing the text I want to split
9:37 and the output cell is E5.
9:39 That's the cell that contains the final result.
9:42 Let's preview it.
9:45 I'll give it a bit more space,
9:46 so there's my function
9:48 I haven't had to write a single line of code.
9:51 Amazing!
9:51 It's taken the 3 separate formulas from the cells
9:55 and written the lambda for me.
9:57 We can change the function name.
9:58 For example, let's get rid of the underscore.
10:01 I'll go ahead and create it.
10:03 You can see it there listed in my functions tab,
10:05 let's use it in the grid
10:09 equals Product
10:11 and you can see it appears in the autocomplete list.
10:13 I can simply use my arrow keys to navigate
10:16 and TAB to select it.
10:17 The string is in cell B5,
10:20 I'll close parentheses and there's the result.
10:23 I'll double click to copy it down
10:25 just like a regular formula.
10:26 Amazing! I haven't needed to know how to write a lambda
10:31 to create my own custom function
10:33 and it travels with this workbook, so any Microsoft 365
10:36 users you share it with can also use it.
10:40 Now there's a load more to the
10:41 Excel Labs Advanced Formula
10:43 Environment that you should check out
10:44 in the video here.
10:46 We just saw Excel write
10:48 a complicated lambda formula based on formulas I'd
10:51 already written,
10:53 but how about having Excel do all the work from scratch?
10:57 Now that would be life changing.
10:59 Now, the features I'm about to show you are so new
11:02 it's still in development
11:04 and they're currently
11:05 only available in Excel Online for all US
11:08 English users of Microsoft 365
11:10 with a personal or family subscription.
11:14 Let's take a look.
11:15 Let's look at splitting
11:16 this text into first name and last name columns.
11:19 I'll just give it a couple of examples.
11:21 It's detected a pattern
11:23 and is suggesting I use a formula.
11:25 If you think it's going to get the formula right,
11:27 you can jump to click
11:28 Apply. Incredible! Notice it also corrects the case,
11:33 detecting that I also want upper case first initial.
11:36 We can see it's built
11:37 into the formula with the use of the PROPER function.
11:39 Let's see how it handles the surname.
11:43 Let's take a look at the formula this time.
11:45 Now this is a bit more complicated
11:47 because it's realized that some names
11:49 have a middle initial
11:50 and it needs to allow for that
11:52 it hasn't handled the case sensitivity here,
11:55 and that's probably
11:55 because I didn't get to give it the example for Bond,
11:58 but I can go ahead and fix the ones it got wrong
12:01 and it's detected that the formula needs modifying
12:04 and we can see here it's added the PROPER function
12:08 and notice it's updated the formula
12:10 for all the cells in the column
12:12 autocorrecting itself.
12:15 It can also rearrange data.
12:17 For example.
12:17 Here I might want my phone numbers separated
12:20 with a hyphen between each set of 3 digits.
12:24 Let's give it a few examples
12:27 and we'll take a look at the formula.
12:29 That formula is quite long.
12:31 It's a bit hard to get my head around,
12:32 so let's take a gamble and see what it looks like.
12:36 Looks like it got it right.
12:38 It's correctly added the hyphen between each
12:40 set of 3 digits.
12:42 Good to go.
12:44 Formula by example can also handle math equations.
12:48 It's triggered when it detects the manual entry of data
12:51 that it thinks it can calculate with a formula.
12:54 It's detected that I appear to be multiplying
12:56 the quantity times the price
12:58 and we can see here.
12:59 It's even corrected my hard keyed entries
13:02 with the formulas
13:03 and that way, if I change anything in the table,
13:06 it's going to feed through to that column and
13:08 update automatically.
13:09 Incredible, that's just a few examples,
13:12 but check out the video
13:13 here for my comprehensive tutorial on formula
13:16 by example. For other cool things it can do. Well
13:19 that wraps up the 8
13:21 current AI tools available in Excel.
13:23 You can download the file for this tutorial
13:25 from the link here
