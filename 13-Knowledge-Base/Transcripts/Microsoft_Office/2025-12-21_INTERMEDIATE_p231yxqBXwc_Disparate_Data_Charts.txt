0:00 charts enable us to identify Trends
0:02 patterns and relationships in our data
0:04 at a glance however they can also
0:07 mislead Us in this video we're going to
0:10 look at plotting disparate data in line
0:12 charts and how they can easily portray
0:14 the wrong message and we'll look at the
0:15 options that you have available to
0:17 ensure you don't mislead your audience
0:19 when plotting this type of
0:21 data this line chart plots the trend of
0:23 revenue and profit over time it looks
0:26 like revenue is growing faster than
0:27 profit after all revenue shows a steady
0:30 incline whereas profits quite flapped
0:33 presenting a chart like this is going to
0:35 raise questions like what's eating up
0:37 all the revenue did our cost of goods
0:39 sold increase or overheads increase and
0:42 the answer is neither it's simply a case
0:45 of Relativity a 10% increase on 2
0:47 million is always going to be a bigger
0:49 number than a 10% increase on 200,000
0:52 and when you plot disparate data that
0:54 continues to grow over time even at the
0:57 same rate the gap's going to widen
1:05 if we set the vertical axis to use a log
1:07 scale which we can do by selecting the
1:09 axis control one to open the formatting
1:12 pane let me drag it over into site and
1:15 then under access options we can check
1:18 the box for logarithmic scale and we can
1:20 see that revenue and profit are actually
1:22 growing at similar rates using a log
1:25 scale is one option to prevent line
1:27 chart lies but some people find these a
1:30 bit confusing to interpret so let's look
1:32 at another
1:39 chart now we can edit the series options
1:42 to plot the profit on the secondary axis
1:45 select the line control1 and then under
1:48 series options secondary
1:51 AIS now we also need access titles to
1:54 make it clear so let's add
1:56 those and there's a load of fapping
1:59 about while we type them in and we don't
2:02 need one for the
2:03 dates Now using a secondary axis in
2:06 these instances is a popular choice
2:08 however among data visualization gurus
2:11 they're discouraged because they're
2:12 difficult to quickly see which access is
2:14 for which line the other problem they
2:17 pose is since they use different scales
2:20 they can result in an unclear message in
2:23 this chart the lines for revenue and
2:24 profit follow a similar upward Trend but
2:26 we can't compare the actual growth rate
2:28 of one against the other
2:30 the uneducated chart reader may even
2:32 make the incorrect assumption that
2:34 profit is performing better than Revenue
2:37 because the profit line ends at a higher
2:39 Point irrespective of the scales now we
2:42 humans make Split Second assumptions
2:44 based on what we see often without even
2:46 realizing we need to be mindful of this
2:48 and try to present data in a way that's
2:51 quick to interpret but also consider any
2:53 misinformation they might inadvertently
2:56 convey now a compromise might be to add
2:59 data label to the end of these lines
3:01 with the start and end dollar values of
3:03 the revenue and profit percentage growth
3:05 but it will start to get a bit cluttered
3:07 so let's look at some other
3:14 options panel charts which in their
3:17 basic form are simply two separate
3:19 charts as I've got here enable you to
3:22 clearly see the growth in each series
3:24 and the separate AIS scales enable
3:26 quicker interpretation than the
3:28 secondary AIS charts however there's
3:30 still a large gap between the lines
3:32 which makes it difficult to compare them
3:34 again this could also be aided by adding
3:36 labels for percentage
3:43 growth now this chart plots the change
3:46 in revenue and profit values over time
3:48 relative to the starting position in
3:51 2011 these values are known as index
3:54 numbers and I'll explain more on that in
3:56 a moment now this chart tells a
3:58 completely different story to the
3:59 original line chart here we can clearly
4:01 see that the growth rate of revenue and
4:03 profit have followed a fairly similar
4:05 pattern and in 2022 it's almost the
4:09 same we calculate the index by saying
4:13 that in 2011 our base period both
4:16 revenue and profit were 100 or 100% and
4:20 from there we calculate the change for
4:23 each year since 2011 since L D5 we can
4:26 see that the index revenue is 114 which
4:29 is the same as saying that the revenue
4:31 in 2012 is 14% higher than it was in
4:34 2011 likewise the profit in 2012 is 7%
4:38 less than it was in 2011 and each
4:41 subsequent year is also compared to 2011
4:43 to come up with the index value for that
4:46 year the formula is simply B4 / B4 and
4:50 we've absolute referenced the
4:52 denominator Times by 100 and then we
4:55 copy it down so D5 contains B5 divid B4
4:59 and so on you can see here I've also
5:03 added some labels that explicitly call
5:05 out the values for the last year and the
5:08 percentage it is increased over time if
5:11 we look in the formula by you can see
5:13 this label is linked to cell
5:17 j6 likewise for the profit it's linked
5:21 to sell j7 and those sells simply
5:23 contain a text
5:26 formula we could also use these labels
5:28 on some of the other
5:31 charts so there you have four different
5:34 ways you can chart disparate data
5:36 remember to be mindful that your charts
5:38 aren't misleading your audience while
5:40 ensuring they're still quick and easy to
5:42 interpret I hope you found this tutorial
