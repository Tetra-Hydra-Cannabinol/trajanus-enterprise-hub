0:00 visualizing categorical actuals versus
0:03 Target data is often done in a column
0:04 chart but personally I find these slow
0:07 to interpret not to mention sometimes
0:09 you might want to also include a stretch
0:11 Target or a forecast and by then it's
0:13 just too tedious to read let's look at
0:16 some ways we can enhance the boring old
0:18 column chart and make it something
0:19 that's quick and easy to read you know
0:21 the way charts should
0:23 be let's start by transforming this two
0:26 series column chart into something more
0:28 like a thermometer chart I'm going to
0:30 duplicate this chart I've just selected
0:32 it and then contrl D to duplicate that
0:34 way we can compare the two charts side
0:36 by side first I want to select the
0:39 target series and then I'm going to
0:41 control one to open the format data
0:43 series pane the first thing I want to do
0:46 is set the series overlap to 100% And
0:49 then in the Paint Bucket tab I'm going
0:51 to set the fill to no fill and I want
0:55 the border to be a dark blue and let's
0:58 increase the width to 1 and A2 now
1:01 immediately we can see which managers
1:03 are above or below Target I think you'll
1:06 agree it's quicker and easier to
1:07 interpret than the regular column chart
1:09 on the
1:11 left but what happens if you have three
1:14 series like this chart with the actual
1:16 Target and stretch Target again I'll
1:19 duplicate the chart so we can compare
1:21 them side by side first I want to select
1:24 the target series and control1 to open
1:27 the format data series pane I'm going to
1:29 set the overlap to 100% And then let's
1:33 format it with no fill and we'll set the
1:36 border the same as the previous
1:39 one and I'll just select the actual
1:41 series now if you're having trouble
1:43 selecting series you can always go up to
1:45 the format Tab and then in the drop down
1:47 here you can select the series that you
1:49 want so I want to format the actual
1:51 series just with a lighter shade of blue
1:55 and we'll just to solid fill just to
1:58 help with the contrast next I want to
2:00 make the stretch series into a dash line
2:03 so I first need to select it let's use
2:06 this technique up here so we can be sure
2:08 we've got the right series and I want to
2:10 change the chart type so up in the
2:12 design tab we're going to change chart
2:14 type and in here we want the stretch
2:16 series to be the line with
2:19 markers and I'll click okay now all I
2:22 need to do is format the line so that
2:25 there's no line and then let's format
2:28 the marker in marker option we want the
2:30 built-in dashed line I'm going to
2:33 increase the size to 14 and then let's
2:37 set the fill to a darker shade so it
2:39 stands out I'm going to set it to the
2:41 same shade as the target let's do the
2:44 same for the border for the marker now
2:46 you could set the marker shade to a
2:49 different color if you prefer but since
2:51 they're both targets it makes sense to
2:53 leave them as the same color and let the
2:55 marker itself differentiate the series
2:58 so there's our new sh again we can more
3:01 easily compare the three series at a
3:04 glance I hope you can make use of this
