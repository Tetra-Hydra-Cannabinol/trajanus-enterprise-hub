0:00 Today, we're going to be exploring ways you
can leverage ChatGPT to transform the way
0:04 you work with Excel. Imagine having formulas
effortlessly crafted for you and uncovering
0:09 shortcuts to make everything simpler. But
before we dive into our first example,
0:14 I've got a quick question for you. What's the
one Excel task or formula that always seems
0:19 to stump you? Share your answers in the comments.
I'm curious to see what challenges you face.
0:24 Here I have a dataset containing
the sales for a coffee shop,
0:28 selling six types of coffee. Now let's say I
0:31 want to find out what the maximum sales revenue
was from any coffee, but I have no clue which
0:37 Excel function to use. Let's open ChatGPT
side by side Excel. I'll use the Windows shortcut,
0:42 key, windows and the left arrow to dock Excel
to the left side and then select ChatGPT for
0:49 the right side. In the message box, I'll ask my
question, "What Excel formula should I use to
0:55 find the maximum value in a
column?" And just like that,
1:00 it replies with the answer. And it says here,
1:02 replace A1 to A10 with the actual range where your
1:05 data is located. Let's try
it, I'll copy the code and
1:09 paste it into Excel and replace this range with
the cells in my table. And there we go. Of course,
1:16 now I want to know what the best-selling coffee
was, so let's ask ChatGPT. "What formula would I
1:21 use to find the product that had the maximum
sales where the product is in cells C4 to C9 and
1:27 the sales values are in D4 to D9, I'm using
Microsoft 365?" Specifying the cell references
1:33 here saves me having to modify the formula that
ChatGPT returns and telling it what version of
1:38 Excel I have, helps it know what functions I can
use. It suggests the INDEX and MATCH functions,
1:44 which can be a bit daunting. So let's ask it if
there's an easier formula I can use. Okay, it's
1:52 suggesting XLOOKUP and that'll partly be
because I told it I have Microsoft 365 and
1:57 it knows this function is available to me. So
you can see that follow-up questions to ChatGPT
2:02 are a great way for beginners to rapidly
become experts at Excel. Here, within seconds
2:07 we found two solutions to one problem, something
that can often take many years to discover on
2:12 your own. Alright, I'll copy
the formula and enter it in
2:16 my spreadsheet and I can see the best-selling
2:19 coffee is Frappe. Chances are you run into formula
errors working with Excel, I've definitely had my
2:24 fair share. It happens to all of us. The great
thing is ChatGPT can help us out. It's not only
2:30 good at creating formulas, but also
at fixing those pesky errors. Suppose
2:35 beginning the new year, our
coffee shop is going to add
2:38 four more types of coffees to its
menu. I've created a spreadsheet to
2:42 record the sales. There are four columns in my
table and I've calculated the average revenue
2:47 per coffee in column D, But as you can see, the
four new coffee types have no prior sales. So my
2:53 formula returns a #DIV/0! error. Now the error
will resolve when I enter sales for those coffees,
2:59 but the errors are off-putting, so let's see if
we can hide them. "In my sales data table. I'm
3:05 trying to calculate the average revenue per item
in range D4 to D13. The formula in D4 is B4/C4,
3:14 but it's giving #DIV/0! error when sales are
zero. How can I fix this?" Okay. It's suggesting
3:21 using the IFERROR function. Let's copy it and
I'll paste it into my table. Job done! Now we have
3:27 "N/A" instead of ugly #DIV/0! errors. Of course,
you could also replace now with a 0 if you prefer.
3:33 Returning the appropriate formula or debugging a
formula is just the beginning. ChatGPT is capable
3:39 of much more. Imagine the new coffee shop has now
expanded into five countries. We've gone global!
3:46 And now my spreadsheet contains consolidated sales
for the last two months. There's also another
3:51 sheet someone else inserted that only shows sales
from Canada for Frappe, which was our bestselling
3:57 coffee, remember? It uses a FILTER formula, but
it looks a bit complicated. So let's ask it to
4:03 explain this Excel formula step by step and then
I'll copy the formula and paste it into ChatGPT.
4:12 Specifying step by step in the prompt ensures
I'll get a breakdown of each component rather
4:16 than just a general overview. Okay, point 1 says
FILTER(Data!A:D,..., is the main structure of the
4:24 formula which filters a specified range based on
certain conditions. Point 2 explains this part of
4:30 the formula is filter criteria Data!A:A, checks
if the values in column A equal "Canada" and
4:37 Data!B:B checks if the values
in column B equal "Frappe".
4:41 2 boolean arrays are multiplied together using an
4:43 * which acts as a logical AND operation. This
means that only rows that both conditions
4:49 are true will pass through the filter and point 3
"Canada has no Frappe sales" is value to display
4:55 If no rows meet the filter criteria and then it
goes on to summarize further. But now at least
5:01 it doesn't look so daunting, and I think I can
modify it to suit my requirements. For example,
5:07 let's change it to Turkish Coffee and I'll add
another condition where sales on the Data sheet
5:14 column C are greater than 10,000. There we go!
Remember, if you make a mistake, you can always
5:22 ask ChatGPT to fix it for you. As you can see,
ChatGPT is extremely helpful when you're working
5:29 on a spreadsheet you inherited from someone
else, making it super quick to get up to speed.
5:34 Speaking of help, if you're still finding Excel
a bit daunting, I've got the solution for you.
5:39 Check out my range of Excel courses designed
5:41 to take you from beginner to
pro in no time. You can find
5:44 them all by clicking the first link in the video
description. One of the easiest ways to save time
5:48 in Excel is with keyboard shortcuts, but with over
200 shortcuts. It's a lot to remember. But ChatGPT
5:55 can recall them in seconds, for example, AutoSum
is one of the most versatile shortcuts, but if
6:01 you don't use it regularly, it's easy to forget.
I'll ask ChatGPT, "What's the Excel keyboard
6:07 shortcut to quickly add up
numbers in a column in Excel?"
6:12 The answer is ALT+ =. Notice,
6:15 it's also given me the Mac shortcut as
a bonus. Let's try it out ALT+ = Tada!
6:22 If you like shortcuts, be sure to download my
6:24 "Periodic Table of Shortcuts" from
the link in the video description.
6:27 There's a version for Windows
and a version for Mac. Macros
6:31 function as your dedicated Excel helpers,
6:33 automating repetitive tasks.
They're written using Visual
6:36 Basic for Applications or VBA for short, and
6:39 they're capable of handling tasks ranging from
6:42 basic formatting to complex
calculations, with the click
6:45 of a button. I've created a PivotTable to help
me quickly analyze my global coffee shop empire,
6:50 and I share this report with some investors.
I have an assistant updating the source data,
6:55 but I want to make sure the PivotTables are
always up to date and that requires a manual click
6:59 of the refresh button. And while it's not hard
or time-consuming, it's critical that it's not
7:04 forgotten. The last thing I want is my investors
getting a report that's out of date. Now,
7:08 I'm sure I can do this with VBA, but I'm not
a programmer, so let's ask ChatGPT to help.
7:14 "Create VBA code to refresh PivotTable1 located
in the VBA_Pivot sheet when the Data sheet in the
7:20 same workbook is no longer active. I'm a beginner
7:24 and I need to know the steps
to save the VBA in my file."
7:27 Again, I'm telling you the names I think it
will need to reference in the VBA code that
7:32 way I have less edits to make and in mentioning
my level of ability it'll give me more detailed
7:38 instructions to ensure I can use the code that
it provides. Alright, it's written some VBA code
7:44 and it explains how to add it to my workbook.
So, let's follow the steps and see if it works.
7:49 I'll copy the code, and then I'm back in Excel.
7:53 Step 1 is ALT+ F11 to open
the Visual Basic Editor.
7:57 Step 2 is open the Project
Explorer with Control + R.
8:02 Step 3, expand the workbook,
but mine's already expanded.
8:06 Step 4 is right-click 'ThisWorkbook' and select
'View Code'. Step 5 is paste in the VBA code
8:13 and then close the VBA editor. Okay, to test it
out, I'll edit the values for Canada for January,
8:21 so make a note of the amount here and on the
Data sheet, I'll change the value for Canada
8:27 Cuban Espresso. And as I navigate away from
the date sheet, the pivot tables should update.
8:35 And you can see the amount for Canada for January
has changed. Just keep in mind that when you
8:39 add VBA to your file, you have to save it as
a .xlsm file type. As it explains here. Now,
8:46 VBA is the original way to automate tasks in
Excel and it still used a lot, but it can't
8:51 execute in Excel online. Whereas the newer way to
automate tasks using Office Scripts can. So check
