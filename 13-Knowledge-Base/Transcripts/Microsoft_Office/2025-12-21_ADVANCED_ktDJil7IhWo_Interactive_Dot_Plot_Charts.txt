0:00 a common mistake people make is to plot
0:03 categorical data in a line chart here we
0:06 have the ratings for the degree of
0:08 difficulty of each sport for the
0:10 categories on the horizontal axis and I
0:12 think you'll agree there are way too
0:14 many sports for it to be any use
0:16 although some might call it chart art
0:19 when you have a lot of series to display
0:21 in a chart you need to decide whether to
0:23 separate your data into panel charts or
0:25 spark lines so you can clearly view each
0:28 series or you could focus on just one or
0:31 two series and let the other series
0:33 provide context in the Dot Plot chart
0:35 here we've called out one sport speed
0:37 skating and the other sports show the
0:40 range and distribution in each skill we
0:42 could add a slicer to allow our readers
0:45 to select the sport they w't highlighted
0:47 in the chart let's take a
0:49 look the trick here is that there are
0:52 two charts the chart on top shows the
0:55 sport selected in the slicer but if I
0:58 move it to the right you can see there's
0:59 an another chart behind and the chart
1:02 behind is plotting all of the
1:04 sports now the data for this chart is
1:07 here in an Excel table you can see I've
1:10 got the sport the skill and the score
1:13 and I've created a pivot table from that
1:15 data this pivot table is the source for
1:18 the chart on the bottom that shows all
1:20 of the sports so let's go ahead and I'll
1:23 insert a line chart with markers based
1:26 on this data now this is a pivot chart
1:29 so it's showing these field buttons
1:31 first thing I want to do is hide all the
1:33 field buttons then we'll go in and we'll
1:36 remove the grid lines and the
1:38 legend let's make the chart a bit bigger
1:41 I want this chart to be 11 by
1:45 17 next we need to actually format each
1:49 line and marker so that all we can see
1:51 is the marker so I'm going to select one
1:55 and control one to open the format
1:56 series pain in the Paint Bucket I want
1:59 to say no line and then under marker
2:02 options I want the built-in marker size
2:05 9 we're going to make it a bit bigger
2:07 and then I want to give that a solid
2:08 feel but I need it to be a more pale
2:11 gray color so it sits in the background
2:14 and we need to repeat that for the line
2:15 of the
2:17 marker and then I need to rinse and
2:19 repeat for each line so back into line
2:22 settings no line marker builtin size 9
2:27 solid fill thankfully it picks up the
2:30 gray and likewise for the border now
2:33 there are a ton of lines in this chart
2:35 so doing it manually is quite tedious
2:38 thankfully though I have a macro so on
2:42 the developer tab under my macros I've
2:44 got this chart series format with my
2:47 chart selected I'm going to run the
2:48 macro and it fixes all the formatting in
2:51 the blink of an eye the next thing I
2:53 want to do is fix this vertical axis
2:56 height the maximum score anyone can get
2:59 is 10 so I'm going to fix it to a
3:01 maximum of 10 and that way I'm going to
3:04 control the axes on both charts so that
3:07 they're the same height it's important
3:09 that the scale on the axis is the same
3:12 in both charts otherwise your dots
3:13 aren't going to line up now I've just
3:16 given myself a bit of space at the top
3:17 cuz we're going to put the legend up
3:20 there and now I'm ready to create my
3:24 next chart which is the one that
3:26 contains the dot of the selected item in
3:29 the slice
3:30 so I'm just going to scroll down a
3:32 little bit and we'll close this for a
3:33 moment now I can't use a pivot chart for
3:37 my chart that sits on top because I want
3:39 to limit the number of series that the
3:41 user can display as highlighted dots in
3:43 the chart to just one spot and as you
3:46 probably know a pivot chart will display
3:48 everything in the pivot table case in
3:50 point this pivot chart displays all of
3:53 these points and I can't pick and choose
3:56 whereas if I use a regular chart then I
3:58 can control the sales that the chart
4:01 references that said I still want to use
4:03 a slicer to allow my user to select the
4:06 sports because that's a nice user
4:08 experience so we're going to insert a
4:10 dummy pivot table again I'll select the
4:13 data insert pivot table so going to put
4:17 it on an existing
4:19 worksheet put it here in my workings so
4:22 put it in cell B18 and click okay now
4:26 I'm just going to right click and go to
4:28 the pivot table options and turn off the
4:30 auto fit cuz I don't want this pivot
4:33 table to mess with the size of my
4:36 columns this pivot table is just going
4:38 to contain the sports going across the
4:41 columns so at the moment there's no
4:43 filter it's listed all of the sports and
4:45 you can see them behind the chart there
4:47 the next thing I want to do for this
4:49 pivot table is insert the slicer this is
4:51 going to be what my user chooses the
4:54 sports to highlight in the chart from so
4:57 I'm going to right click add a slicer
5:00 so we' got our slicer now if I select
5:02 one sport in the slicer it filters the
5:05 pivot table now I don't need the grand
5:07 total so right click remove the grand
5:09 total so we've got the slicer for the
5:12 interactivity and we've got the pivot
5:15 chart that shows all of the dots now I
5:18 need to collate the data that's going to
5:20 feed my second chart remember I can't
5:23 use a pivot chart so I'm going to build
5:26 a table manually but I need this list of
5:28 sports and I'm just going to paste them
5:30 there and then we're going to populate
5:32 the values using an index and match
5:35 formula so let me just move this across
5:37 here so we got a bit of room so index
5:41 where are we indexing well we want to
5:42 find the values from the pivot table and
5:46 then which row number do we want
5:48 returned well I want all of the rows
5:50 returned all of these ones so I'm going
5:52 to skip this argument you could enter a
5:54 zero in here that will also return all
5:56 the rows but one less character is
5:59 slight slightly more efficient the next
6:01 argument is column number well I'm going
6:03 to use match to find what column auto
6:06 racing is in this row up here we need an
6:11 exact match so the argument for exact
6:14 match is zero now let me just scroll
6:16 back so you can see the formula again
6:19 close match close index now I have
6:22 Office 365 so when I press enter you're
6:25 going to see the results of the formula
6:27 spill to the cells below if you don't
6:30 have Office 365 then you can still use
6:32 this formula let me copy it and show you
6:35 what you need to do is select all of the
6:38 cells first then enter your formula then
6:42 contrl shift and enter and you get the
6:44 same results so just remember to select
6:47 the cells first and finish with control
6:49 shift and enter so I'll delete that
6:51 there we're going to use this data here
6:53 for our next chart now remember we don't
6:55 want a pivot chart so I'm just selecting
6:58 the row labels and the the values not
7:00 the header which is a pivot table then
7:02 I'm going to insert the same type of
7:05 chart the line chart with markers let's
7:07 go ahead we're going to get rid of the
7:09 chart title get rid of the grid lines
7:11 put a legend at the top that's going to
7:13 tell us what sport is selected now
7:15 because I didn't include the auto racing
7:18 cell in my selection when I inserted the
7:20 chart the series has no name so I'm
7:23 going to right click and select the data
7:25 I'm going to edit the series and
7:27 reference that cell there this won't
7:29 convert it to a pivot chart so we're all
7:31 safe with that now we can see the name
7:35 correctly in the
7:36 legend next I need to format this line
7:39 just like I did for the other chart so
7:41 control one let's get rid of that in the
7:45 paint brush we want no line the marker
7:48 is the built-in size nine now for the
7:51 solid fill we want to pick a color
7:53 that's going to stand out so I'm going
7:54 to go with this blue color here and we
7:57 need to repeat that for the solid line
8:00 so our chart is pretty much done the
8:02 size isn't quite right so let's go ahead
8:05 and format it 11 by
8:08 17 so now we have our charts that are
8:11 the same size let's align them we'll
8:14 move some things around so we've got
8:16 some more space and I'll bring this up
8:18 into view so there's my chart showing
8:21 the selected values in the slicer let me
8:25 select the legend and just fix the
8:27 maximum to 10 so that it's consistent
8:29 with the chart
8:31 behind and in order for the chart behind
8:34 to show through I need to make the fill
8:36 color for this chart transparent so
8:38 let's go in and format the shape fill to
8:42 no fill and we'll also get rid of the
8:45 outline now you can see the chart behind
8:48 if I move it around let's align them so
8:51 we'll use the Align tools to center it
8:54 vertically and
8:55 horizontally now I've got to do a little
8:57 bit of adjustment on on the chart area
9:01 because you can see this vertical axis
9:03 isn't quite aligned so let's adjust them
9:08 okay so our charts are nicely aligned
9:10 our axes match up we've got a little bit
9:13 of double vision going on because we can
9:15 still see the axis labels from the chart
9:18 behind so what I'm going to do is Select
9:20 them and just format the font to White
9:23 so that we can't see them at all make
9:25 sure you do it on the chart behind
9:27 otherwise the white will sit on top of
9:29 the labels on the chart behind and you
9:31 don't want
9:32 that so let's align them
9:38 again and as a Finishing Touch I'm just
9:41 going to move this Legend across to the
9:43 left so now when our user selects a spot
9:47 in the slicer the chart on top
9:50 updates to give the illusion that
9:54 there's only one chart now in this
9:57 example I only want my user to select
9:59 one sport but really there's nothing to
10:01 stop them selecting multiple Sports and
10:03 you can see them behind here but those
10:06 Sports aren't being plotted in the chart
10:08 so we want to help guide them and we can
10:11 do that in a couple of ways the first
10:12 one is I'm going to right click and go
10:14 into the slicer settings and just give
10:16 them a little tool tip in the header
10:20 here so select one sport but if they
10:23 don't select one sport maybe they're
10:26 just a little cheeky then we want to
10:28 pull out the big guns and give them a
10:31 red warning sign so what I'm going to do
10:33 let me just select all of these and move
10:35 them across so you can see I can use an
10:38 if formula here to test whether this
10:41 cell here is blank if it's blank then I
10:44 know that they haven't selected more
10:46 than one item so I can just return a
10:48 blank but if it contains text or any
10:52 value then it suggests to me that
10:55 they've selected more than one sport and
10:57 I'm going to give them a warning about
10:58 that
10:59 so we're just going to tell them select
11:02 only one sport close my parentheses so
11:07 you can see when I select more than one
11:09 the warning comes up when I select only
11:12 one the warning is hidden but obviously
11:15 we need to put that somewhere that
11:16 they're going to see that warning so
11:19 with the chart selected I'm going to
11:22 insert a text
11:24 box over
11:27 here and then select the outside of the
11:30 text box equals and I'm going to link it
11:33 to the cell that contains my if formula
11:35 and press enter now let's select
11:38 multiple items now you can see the text
11:41 box Returns the error let's make it a
11:45 bit more in your face we'll make it red
11:48 to really stand out so now if they
11:51 select one spot they don't get a warning
11:53 if they select more than one they get
11:55 the warning sign so you can use this
11:57 technique in lots of areas to guide your
12:00 users and to put in some safety nets to
12:04 prevent them making
12:07 mistakes you can download the Excel file
12:09 for this lesson from the link here I
12:11 hope you can make use of this technique
