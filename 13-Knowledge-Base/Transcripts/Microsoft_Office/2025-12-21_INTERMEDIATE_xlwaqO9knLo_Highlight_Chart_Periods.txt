0:00 shading or highlighting periods in Excel
0:02 charts can help users more quickly
0:04 interpret them and identify patterns in
0:07 this chart I've highlighted every second
0:09 month to give a quick visual indication
0:11 of each period and this allows the user
0:14 to focus on the line instead of having
0:16 to refer back and forth to the
0:17 horizontal axis or you can use this
0:20 technique to focus their attention on a
0:22 specific period like the winter months
0:24 in this chart and we can use this same
0:27 technique to highlight a single date or
0:29 even several points and the good news is
0:32 it's super easy let's take a
0:34 look here I have my chart Source data
0:38 starting in column B are the dates now
0:40 this column isn't actually plotted in
0:42 the chart instead I have two helper
0:45 columns C and D for the month and day
0:47 and they'll form a nested axis the
0:50 formula in column C uses if to identify
0:53 the first date in each month and the
0:56 formula in column D uses if with Mod to
0:58 list every seventh date this avoids the
1:01 axis getting cluttered and makes it
1:03 easier to read a whole Year's worth of
1:05 data now the secret to these techniques
1:08 is to plot another series on the
1:09 secondary axis for highlighting or
1:12 shading and that's what I have here in
1:14 column F in my example the even months
1:17 are shaded and you can see the formula
1:19 returns true if the month number is even
1:22 and when you plot true in a chart it's
1:25 the equivalent of one and you'll see
1:26 that in a moment I'll start by selecting
1:29 the chart data remember I don't want
1:32 column B that contains the dates we're
1:35 just going to insert a line
1:38 chart bring it up here and make it a bit
1:42 bigger now I need to change the chart
1:45 type for the shade month series to a
1:47 clustered column so I'm going to right
1:49 click change chart type down here I want
1:53 combo the temperature values I want as a
1:56 line and the shade month I want as the
1:59 cluster column and we're going to pop
2:01 that on the secondary axis you can see
2:03 in the preview it's already taking
2:06 shape next we need to format these
2:09 columns so I'm going to select one of
2:10 them control one that opens the format
2:13 data series here I want the Gap width to
2:16 be
2:17 zero and we're just going to tone down
2:19 the color to make it something more
2:21 subtle let's go with a pale shade of
2:23 gray next I want to modify the secondary
2:27 axis so that the maximum is is one that
2:30 will just take the column to the top of
2:32 the chart now I've done that I want to
2:34 hide the secondary axis so we're going
2:36 to go into tick marks and set the major
2:39 Type To None and with labels we also
2:42 want
2:44 none lastly I can put some finishing
2:46 touches on like perhaps getting rid of
2:48 the grid lines let's move the legend up
2:52 to the top and we'll get rid of the
2:55 shade month Legend we don't need that
2:58 self-explanatory let's give it the chart
3:01 title and we're good to go so there you
3:04 have a shaded months which may help your
3:06 reader interpret the chart more quickly
3:09 now A variation on this technique is to
3:11 shade period so let's take a look here
3:14 I've simply changed the formula for the
3:16 Shaded area to check if the dates fall
3:18 within our winter period of June to
3:20 August and instead of gray shading I've
3:22 used blue to represent winter otherwise
3:25 everything else is the same in terms of
3:27 the way the chart is built and you can
3:29 obviously modify this technique to suit
3:31 your business needs you might want to
3:33 highlight quarters or there might be a
3:35 specific period in your sales calendar
3:37 that you want to focus
3:39 on an alternative to shading areas is to
3:42 highlight just one date either with a
3:45 vertical line or a marker here in column
3:48 F the formula checks if the temperature
3:50 is equal to the maximum for the year if
3:52 it is the temperature is returned as we
3:55 can see down here in February if not we
3:57 get the na error now I'm I'm using na
4:00 here to hide the line in the chart which
4:03 is required for the second example I'm
4:04 going to show you in a moment so I'm
4:07 just going to select the data and scroll
4:10 to the
4:11 top insert a line chart let's bring it
4:16 up here and we'll make it a bit
4:18 bigger I need to change the chart type
4:22 down here in combo the temperature needs
4:24 to be a line chart and the maximum
4:27 temperature is going to be the cluster
4:28 column here I I'm going to leave them
4:30 both on the primary axxis so I'll click
4:33 okay and you can see the line now for
4:35 the maximum temperature in the chart now
4:38 an alternative is to use a DOT marker
4:41 instead of the line so I'm just going to
4:43 contrl D to duplicate that chart and
4:46 we'll modify it so here I want to right
4:49 click and change the chart type for the
4:51 maximum temperature I want the line
4:53 chart with markers again they both stay
4:56 on the primary axis now click okay you
4:59 can see now the maximum temperature is
5:01 highlighted with the dot now with this
5:04 example it's important that the values
5:07 you don't want plotted in the line are
5:09 returning the na error that will prevent
5:12 the line dipping down to the zero and
5:14 drawing a straight line along the bottom
5:16 of the chart now I just want to select
5:19 that dot and format it because if we
5:23 look at the legend you can see it's
5:25 showing a line with the dot marker and I
5:28 want to just remove that line so I'm
5:30 going to select the series maximum
5:34 temperature in here in the formatting
5:36 which is already open but if it's not
5:38 for you you can control one to open it I
5:40 want to say no line you can see now the
5:43 legend correctly matches the dot marker
5:45 in the chart and with that series
5:48 selected I can also add things like a
5:51 data label just to that series and
5:53 that's going to highlight the maximum
5:56 for the year let's get rid of the grid
5:58 lines and our chart is done can
6:01 obviously add the title and move the LGE
6:04 to the Top If that's where you prefer to
6:06 have it that's typically where I like to
6:07 put my Legend it just takes up a bit
6:09 less space in my
6:13 chart well I hope you found this
6:15 technique useful you can download the
