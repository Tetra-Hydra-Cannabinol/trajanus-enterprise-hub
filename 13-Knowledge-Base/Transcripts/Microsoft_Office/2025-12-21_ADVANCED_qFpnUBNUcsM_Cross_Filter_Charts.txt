0:00 one of the features I love in pobi is
0:03 the ability to click on an item in one
0:05 chart and have the other charts cross
0:07 filter and highlight that selected item
0:09 now unfortunately there's no built-in
0:11 way to do this in Excel but I'm going to
0:14 show you a way we can achieve a very
0:16 similar effect with a little Excel magic
0:19 now I'll be using power pivot charts for
0:21 this however if you don't have a version
0:23 of excel with power pivot you'll find an
0:25 alternate way using formulas included in
0:28 the file that you can download from the
0:30 link in the video description okay let's
0:33 get
0:34 started now before we look at the steps
0:36 for building these charts let's just
0:38 understand the three main components
0:40 first we have here a slicer and that
0:43 provides our
0:44 interactivity now if I drag the slicer
0:47 to the left you'll see it's just been
0:48 cleverly aligned over the vertical axis
0:51 for my brand chart and then I have a
0:54 pivot chart for the product categories
0:57 so with some clever alignment and
0:58 formatting we have something that
1:01 appears as though it's one object and it
1:04 allows our users to interact with it now
1:07 I've only used two charts and Link them
1:09 to this one slicer but you could link a
1:11 whole dashboard to it all right let's
1:14 look at the steps for building the
1:16 charts now I've got a new workbook here
1:18 where I've got my data ready to go it's
1:21 an extract of the Koso sample data from
1:24 Microsoft it's got gross profit by
1:27 product category and brand and date of
1:30 also got a table here for the brands
1:31 which is just a distinct list of them if
1:34 we look at the table design tab you can
1:36 see this table is called Brands and this
1:39 one is called Data that's important we
1:42 need them formatted in a table to load
1:44 them into Power pivot so we go to the
1:46 power paper Tab and load them in now I
1:48 need to just click this add to data
1:50 model button if you have earlier
1:52 versions of excel it might say add
1:55 linked table so click add to dat model
1:58 we'll go back to Excel and we'll add in
2:01 the brand
2:02 table now the next thing I need to do is
2:04 create an inactive relationship between
2:07 these two tables so on the design tab
2:09 we're going to create
2:11 relationship we'll select the data table
2:14 as the primary table and the brand table
2:16 is the secondary table I want this
2:19 relationship to be inactive so we going
2:20 to deselect that and click okay okay so
2:24 I'm done with power pivot let's close
2:26 the window and we're ready to write the
2:29 measures now a measure is the equivalent
2:31 of a calculated field in regular pivot
2:33 tables we can see the measures here
2:35 we've got total gross profit and
2:37 selected brand the selected brand
2:39 measure only Returns the gross profit
2:41 for the selected brand in the slicer so
2:45 let's go ahead and create those I'm
2:47 going to go measures new
2:49 measure the first one's going to be
2:51 called total gross
2:53 profit and it simply
2:56 sums the gross profit so we'll set that
3:00 to a number format we'll do some more
3:02 number formatting shortly and click
3:05 okay and then one more measure for the
3:08 selected
3:10 brand this one uses the calculate
3:12 function so we're going to use that
3:14 measure total gross profit that we just
3:16 wrote but here we want to reactivate
3:19 that inactive relationship so we're
3:21 going to use use relationship to
3:23 activate the relationship between the
3:25 brand column in the brands table and the
3:27 brand column in the data table close use
3:30 relationship and close calculate we'll
3:33 set it to number category and I'll click
3:36 okay so we've got our data loaded and
3:38 our measures written we're ready to
3:40 build the pivot tables so on the insert
3:43 tab of the ribbon pivot table here I
3:45 want to use this workbooks data model
3:48 that's power pivot and put it on a new
3:50 worksheet and click okay right let me
3:53 drag the field list out so that we have
3:55 more room so the first pivot table is
3:57 going to just show my gross profit by by
3:59 brand now I have a brand field in the
4:02 brands table and in the data table so
4:05 it's important here that I use the brand
4:07 field from the data table and I want the
4:09 total gross profit and the selected
4:11 brand let's apply some formatting so
4:13 we're going to go into the valy field
4:15 settings and number format here I want
4:18 to create a custom number format now I'm
4:21 going to cheat a little bit and pick a
4:23 format that's already close to what I
4:25 want and then just modify it so I'm
4:27 going to round it to Millions so I want
4:29 two Comm
4:30 and then M to be clear on the rounding
4:33 and again for the negative format and
4:36 I'll click okay and okay again let's do
4:40 the same for the selected brand measure
4:43 now this custom format is going to be at
4:46 the end of the list so just scroll to
4:48 the end and click
4:50 okay all right so that's our brand pivot
4:53 table let's copy and paste that because
4:55 we've got the formatting already applied
4:57 and instead of by brand this one's by
4:59 product category next we just need to
5:01 insert the slicer so in this case the
5:04 slicer is for Brands but instead of the
5:07 brand fi from the data table I want to
5:10 use the brand fi from the brands table
5:13 and add a
5:14 slicer we get this warning that we may
5:18 need a relationship set up that's
5:20 because the relationship is inactive I'm
5:22 going to just ignore that because I want
5:25 it to be inactive now when I click on a
5:27 brand in the slice you can see the gross
5:30 profit the total gross profit doesn't
5:32 change but the selected brand measure
5:36 recognizes the relationship between the
5:38 tables and filters
5:42 accordingly now you notice that it's
5:44 filtered this pivot table but not this
5:46 one so we need to assign the report
5:49 connections to both pivot tables I'll
5:52 click okay and now they're both
5:54 recognizing the slicer so we're ready to
5:57 insert our pivot charts one for each
5:59 each pivot table so I'm just going to
6:01 close the field list and we'll go to the
6:04 analyze Tab and pivot chart here I want
6:06 a bar chart this gives me more room for
6:09 my long
6:10 labels and let's do the same for this
6:14 one again bar chart all right I'll just
6:17 move them so they're not sitting on top
6:19 of each other let's get rid of all the
6:22 fill buttons they just take up way too
6:25 much space just right click and deselect
6:27 them I'm going to control one to open
6:30 the formatting pane so this one I want
6:32 the series to overlap by 100% so this is
6:35 my selected brand I want it to sit on
6:37 top of the total gross profit
6:41 columns and this one's going to be 30%
6:44 Gap width to just make our bars a little
6:46 Bolder now I want to sort these in
6:49 alphabetical order so I can change the
6:51 order of the
6:53 categories and put them in reverse order
6:55 but then I have to fiddle about with
6:57 this horizontal axis as well so it's
6:59 easier just to sort these by Z to A and
7:03 then that feeds through to the
7:05 chart and this one here I actually want
7:09 to sort it based on the value so I'm
7:11 going to sort it smallest to largest and
7:14 then we have our largest values first
7:16 we're going to have to give these charts
7:17 a bit more room so we can read all the
7:19 labels okay let's concentrate on this
7:21 one for now I don't need the legend here
7:24 I'm just going to have one legend for
7:25 both
7:27 charts now I want to remove the border
7:31 on the chart outline so go no outline
7:34 and let's format this in a different
7:36 color so what I want to do is have this
7:39 as the dark blue and then the total
7:41 gross profit for all of the brands in
7:42 this lighter shade of blue all right
7:45 we'll make this a bit
7:46 bigger actually what we'll do is we'll
7:49 find out what the size of this one is so
7:51 it's 12.52 high let's apply the same to
7:56 this one so we'll make it 12.5
7:59 two then we can align them with them
8:03 both selected align to the top all right
8:07 so to save some time I want to copy the
8:08 formatting in this chart and apply it to
8:10 this one so I'm going to contrl + C to
8:12 copy and then select this chart and
8:15 paste so now our charts are formatted
8:19 the same let's minimize this so we've
8:21 got more room I'm going to move this
8:23 over here and this one along theide and
8:28 we want our slice to sit on top so let's
8:30 go up to the slic of settings and we'll
8:32 bring this to the front we also need to
8:36 hide the header so we don't want to
8:38 display the
8:40 header and I need to make the
8:43 slicer closer to the size of the chart
8:46 so what we need to do is give the
8:49 chart more room for the
8:52 slicer make that narrower bring this
8:55 across and sit it on top now I need to
8:57 make the buttons bigger so let's just
9:00 increase the height until they're
9:01 aligned so let's give it a bit more
9:04 space until it fits in okay so it's
9:08 almost align to the Chart we might need
9:10 to make it a bit bigger actually I don't
9:13 want to spend too much time messing
9:15 about with the slicer because I think
9:17 you get the idea make that
9:20 1.025 all right nearly there now the
9:23 slicer has a border on it so we want to
9:25 remove that border unfortunately there's
9:27 no easy way to do that but on the slicer
9:29 tab we can create our own custom slicer
9:32 style so I'm going to right click the
9:34 style it currently is formatted in
9:36 duplicate it and then we'll modify it so
9:39 this one will be called no border the
9:42 other thing I want to do is make sure
9:43 the buttons in the slicer match the
9:46 color of the column that's selected so
9:48 we want to format the whole
9:51 slicer with no
9:54 border and then I want to format the
9:57 buttons for the select ED item with data
10:01 so that the fill is this darker blue and
10:04 we'll make the font white because it'll
10:06 be harder to read when it's a black font
10:08 with the dark blue so click okay now all
10:11 I need to do is apply that format to my
10:14 slicer and it appears as one with the
10:17 chart now I'd like to add some data
10:19 labels to my chart so I only want to add
10:22 the labels for the selected brand so I'm
10:25 going to select that first and then
10:26 choose data label and do the same for
10:30 this one
10:34 here okay now it' be nicer to format
10:37 those data labels in a font that matches
10:39 the color of the bars and let's do the
10:42 same for this
10:43 one now at the moment this chart is
10:47 sitting behind this one so what I want
10:49 to do is make the fill for this chart
10:53 transparent so no fill and we'll get rid
10:56 of the grid lines on the sheet so so it
10:59 looks neater the problem we have now is
11:01 we can see the pivot table behind so
11:03 let's move them to their new sheet so
11:06 crl X to cut crl + V to paste and we'll
11:10 hide the grid lines there okay so our
11:14 charts are coming together might need to
11:17 make this one a bit smaller so that it's
11:19 not showing so much behind Okay we're
11:22 nearly there all we need is a header
11:25 because if I put a chart title for one
11:27 of the charts going to mess with all of
11:28 the alignment so I prefer just to
11:32 insert a shape I'll just draw it on and
11:37 we'll call it total gross profit by
11:38 brand and
11:40 category let's format the font a little
11:43 bit we'll make it a bit bigger and we'll
11:45 Center it and let's format this so that
11:48 there's no fill and no
11:51 outline and we best make the font a dark
11:54 blue okay so there's our charts one last
11:57 thing we need is a legend so let's just
11:59 add a legend temporarily here I want the
12:01 legend side by side so we'll give it
12:03 some more space I'll delete the grid
12:05 lines in the background I'm going to
12:07 take a screenshot of the legend and then
12:09 I'm going to paste it in up here so now
12:11 that I've got my screenshot let's remove
12:14 the legend and we'll put the grid lines
12:18 back we'll paste in The Legend and
12:20 position it at the top so there we have
12:23 our cross highlighting and filtering
12:25 just like we have in palbi the only
12:28 difference is here we need to use the
12:29 slicer buttons rather than clicking on
12:32 the columns in the bar chart itself I
12:34 think you'll agree it's pretty close to
12:37 what we get in powerbi now remember if
12:39 you don't have power pivot please take a
12:41 moment to download the workbook the
12:43 links available in the video description
12:46 here you can find an example with
12:48 regular pivot tables the only difference
12:50 here is we need a couple of formulas to
12:53 perform the selected brand calculation
12:56 but otherwise it works in exactly the
12:58 same same way and you can see the charts
13:00 down here if I click on the slicer it
13:03 works in the same way the only
13:05 difference is we're using regular charts
13:07 in this example not pivot charts I hope
13:10 you can make use of this technique if
13:12 you like this video please give it the
13:14 Thumbs Up And subscribe to my channel
13:16 for more and why not share it with your
13:18 friends who might also find this
13:19 technique useful thanks for
