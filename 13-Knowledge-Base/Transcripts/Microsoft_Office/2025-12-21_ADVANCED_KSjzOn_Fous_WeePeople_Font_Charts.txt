0:00 Excel we people font charts enable you
0:02 to build interesting variations on
0:04 waffle bar and column charts to name a
0:07 few they're great for visualizing
0:09 demographic data survey data and more
0:12 now some of the techniques I'll show you
0:14 use Dynamic array functions which are
0:16 available in Microsoft 365 and Excel
0:20 2021 but you don't have to use Dynamic
0:22 arrays to create these charts let's take
0:25 a
0:26 look The Free We people font courtesy of
0:29 propile UA consists of 20 different
0:32 people silhouettes handrawn by Alberto
0:34 Cairo there's a link in the video
0:36 description where you can download the
0:38 font now you can see here the last six
0:40 letters of the alphabet U through Zed
0:43 are a repeat of the letter e person
0:45 leaving us with 20 unique
0:48 Silhouettes we can use the code function
0:50 to convert these letters to numbers
0:52 enabling us to work with them in Excel
0:55 here you can see that lowercase a is
0:56 code 97 and Zed is 122
1:00 we can discard you through Z and just
1:02 use codes 97 through 1116 let's look at
1:05 some
1:07 examples here I want to visualize the
1:09 Senate numbers in a waffle chart
1:11 highlighting the women by Democrats and
1:13 Republicans now for those with Microsoft
1:15 365 or Excel 2021 we can use the Rand
1:19 array function and we'll generate a list
1:22 of 100 numbers starting at
1:26 97 and a maximum of 116 and and I want
1:30 integers returned so whole numbers let's
1:33 press enter and we get a spilled array
1:36 of 100 random numbers between 97 and 116
1:40 but we need letters so let's wrap that
1:42 in the car function or character
1:44 function close parentheses and now we
1:47 have a random list of letters between a
1:50 and t however I want a 10x 10 grid so
1:54 I'm going to use the new wrap calls
1:56 function and we want to wrap after 10
1:58 and we'll pad with a blank not that
2:01 we'll need to pad it because it's going
2:03 to be perfectly Square press enter and
2:06 there I have a 10x10 grid of random
2:09 letters between a and t all I need to do
2:12 now is apply the we people font so let's
2:14 scroll down to the bottom and there they
2:17 are there let's change the size we'll
2:20 make it 48 to fill the space and let's
2:23 format it in a shade of gray so it's not
2:26 so harsh now you'll notice every time I
2:29 press 9 or if I edit a cell or enter
2:32 another formula that we get a new set of
2:36 random numbers and therefore a new set
2:39 of random we people if you don't want it
2:41 to change all the time all you need to
2:43 do is copy them and paste them as
2:47 values next I want to color code the 17
2:49 Democrats blue and the nine Republicans
2:52 red and I can do that with conditional
2:54 formatting for this I need a formula
2:56 that will number each cell and that I
2:58 can use in the conditional format
2:59 matting rule I'm going to enter the
3:01 formula here in the worksheet first so
3:04 you can see what it returns and
3:05 hopefully it will make more sense when I
3:07 create the conditional format now I want
3:10 the bottom left cell to be number one
3:12 and the top right to be 100 and I can
3:15 use the columns function to give me a
3:18 column count so we're going to Absolute
3:21 the first reference a and then through
3:23 to a close parentheses on columns that's
3:26 just going to give me one but as I copy
3:28 this formula across it's going to
3:30 increase by one and then we're going to
3:33 add 10 times the number of rows so we're
3:37 going to use the rows function 1 through
3:40 to Absolute 10 close parentheses on rows
3:44 minus one close parentheses on that part
3:47 of the formula and I'll press enter and
3:50 I get 91 and if we want to see how this
3:53 is evaluating we can evaluate each
3:55 component so this part returns one rows
4:01 returns
4:02 10 - 1 is 9 * 10 is 90 + 1 is 91 that's
4:09 how we get 91 and then when I copy it
4:12 down and cross we get our grid of
4:16 numbers 1 through to 100 so I'm going to
4:19 use this formula in my conditional
4:21 format let's just copy it save writing
4:24 it out again I'm going to select my grid
4:27 starting in the top left corner and it's
4:29 important you start in the top left
4:31 because we're going to use a mixture of
4:33 absolute and relative references so that
4:35 first cell that we've selected is really
4:37 important and then on the Home tab I'm
4:40 going to go conditional formatting new
4:42 rule and I want to use a formula and in
4:45 here I'm going to paste in my formula
4:47 that gives me the count and first of all
4:51 I'm applying the red font so I want to
4:53 check that the result of the grid number
4:56 formula is less than or equal to both
5:00 the Democrats plus the Republicans
5:03 values and I'm going to format this red
5:07 so in the font I want the color to be
5:09 red I'm just going to pick this dark red
5:12 click okay and okay again now we have
5:15 the first 26 colored red but I'm going
5:17 to apply the next format and that's
5:19 going to override the first 17 so with
5:22 it's still selected I'm going to create
5:24 another new rule use a formula let's
5:28 paste in the formula that numbers the
5:30 cells and this time I just need to check
5:32 that it's less than or equal to the
5:35 number of Democrats let's apply the
5:37 format this time it's going to be blue
5:41 click okay and okay and now we have 17
5:46 Democrats and nine
5:48 Republicans I've linked this to a date
5:51 validation list so I can choose the next
5:53 Congress the 117th and we get slightly
5:55 different results 16 Democrats and eight
5:58 Republicans we can toggle between the
6:01 two you can see the we people are also
6:03 updating as well as the colorcoded we
6:06 people now if you find the order of the
6:08 colors isn't right you can change it in
6:10 the conditional formatting manage rules
6:12 dialogue box select it and change the
6:15 order I'm going to leave it as is
6:17 because it's working correctly here now
6:19 I know conditional formatting can be a
6:21 bit of a mind Bender so there's a link
6:23 in the video description to my
6:25 comprehensive video that explains how it
6:27 works under the hood we can also use we
6:30 people to create bar charts for example
6:33 if you have Dynamic arrays you can
6:35 create a string of we people using the
6:37 sequence function so here I want to join
6:40 together my text I don't need any
6:42 delimiter here and I want to ignore
6:44 empty cells not that I'm going to have
6:46 any and then we need to wrap the formula
6:49 in the car function so that we get
6:51 letters and then I'm going to use
6:53 sequence to return 20 rows no columns
6:57 will skip that I want to start at 97
6:59 and it's going to step by one which is
7:01 the default so I can skip that argument
7:03 close sequence close car and close text
7:07 join and you'll see we get a string of
7:09 letters and all we need to do then is
7:12 apply the we people font let's make them
7:15 a bit bigger so here I have 20
7:18 Silhouettes in a single cell now I can
7:21 modify sequence to return up to 26
7:24 characters or I can create many more
7:26 with the randay function which is
7:28 available in Microsoft 365 and EXL 2021
7:32 or later another option is to use Rand
7:35 array with C to Spill the Wei people
7:37 into separate cells so starting with
7:40 Rand array I'm going to skip the first
7:42 argument and then I want 10 results
7:45 between 97 and
7:47 116 and I want integers close Rand
7:52 array so you can see it's giving me
7:54 numbers but I want letters so let's wrap
7:56 it in
7:58 car and now I get an array of letters
8:02 all I need to do is apply the
8:08 font and make them a bit
8:11 bigger let's Center them so they fit in
8:14 the cell and we can also use conditional
8:16 formatting here so let me just copy
8:18 these down we'll do two more rows let's
8:21 say I want to highlight the first 30%
8:23 here this one 50% and this one 70% and
8:27 let's change the colors of the these so
8:29 that they're not so harsh so we'll give
8:31 them a paler shade of green and then I'm
8:34 going to highlight 30% of them in a
8:37 darker shade for the first row 50% in a
8:40 darker shade for the second and 70% in a
8:43 darker shade for the third row so on the
8:45 Home tab conditional formatting new rule
8:49 using a formula so here I'm going to use
8:52 the count a or count our function to
8:55 count the number of characters so I want
8:58 C9 through to C9 but let's change the
9:01 absolute referencing so this one F4 so
9:04 that only the column is absolute and
9:06 then this one here not absolute at all
9:09 that way the conditional format will
9:12 increment as it applies it to each cell
9:15 in the selected range so I'm checking
9:18 whether the count is less than or equal
9:20 to the value here and again I only want
9:24 to Absolute the column time 10 we're
9:28 multiplying by 10 to bring the
9:30 percentage in column B in line with the
9:33 values returned by count the supply
9:36 format here it's a font and we'll make
9:38 it a shade of Darker green click okay
9:42 and okay again and there we have a cool
9:45 bar chart kind of effect using we people
9:49 just like bar charts we can create
9:51 column charts again we can use round
9:53 array and we just need to enter the
9:57 number that we want in the rows instead
9:59 of of the columns like we looked at in
10:00 the previous bar chart example so we
10:02 want 10 rows starting at 97 through to
10:06 116 and we want integers close
10:10 parentheses so there I have 10 random
10:13 numbers remember we need to wrap it in
10:15 the car
10:17 function and now we have our
10:19 letters let's format them as we
10:25 people
10:27 and make some bigger to fill the space
10:31 we Center them as well let me copy them
10:35 across and let's make them a shade of
10:38 gray as well so they're not so harsh and
10:40 just like before we can conditionally
10:42 format them so let's say we want to
10:45 color code
10:46 20% 50% and
10:50 70% let's just Center those
10:53 values and we'll make them
10:55 blue and then let's apply the
10:57 conditional formatting on the Home tab
11:00 new rule formula and here we need to use
11:04 the row function so we want rows 1
11:08 through absolute 10 close parentheses
11:11 and the reason we're using rows is
11:13 because we want to number the cells 1
11:15 through 10 starting at the bottom we're
11:17 checking is it less than or equal to the
11:20 value here and I need to change the
11:22 absolute reference so that it's just on
11:24 the row time 10 let's apply the font
11:28 format and we'll go with the dark shade
11:30 of blue click okay and okay and there's
11:34 our conditional formatting so now we
11:37 have a column chart effect using we
11:40 people we people are also great for
11:43 visualizing survey data so again using
11:45 Rand array we can skip the rows we're
11:49 going to create an array of columns
11:51 which will generate a bar chart of we
11:54 people we're going to base it on the
11:55 total number of responses in column F
11:58 and our minimum is 997 maximum 116 and
12:02 we want integers returned close
12:05 parentheses on randay let's wrap it in
12:07 the car function so that it converts it
12:10 to letters which we can then format in
12:13 the we people font I'm just going to
12:15 copy that one
12:17 down and select them
12:19 all and we'll format it in the
12:24 font right down at the
12:26 [Music]
12:27 bottom let's make them a bit
12:30 bigger and we'll Center them so that we
12:32 can see them in the space now I'm not
12:34 going to worry about changing the color
12:35 here cuz I'm actually going to use
12:37 conditional formatting to format them
12:39 into students lectures and staff so with
12:42 them all selected conditional formatting
12:44 new rule and we're going to use a
12:47 formula and because this is a bar chart
12:49 I can use the counter R function or
12:51 count a however you want to say it so
12:53 we're starting with this
12:56 cell and we're going to use absolute
12:58 reference
12:59 so that as a conditional formatting is
13:02 copied
13:03 across it increments by one column at a
13:06 Time closing parentheses on count a and
13:10 I'm just going to copy that cuz I'm
13:11 going to use this part of the formula in
13:14 my other formats as well and the first
13:16 one is Pink So I want to check that the
13:19 count is greater than the sum of the
13:22 students and the lectures and again
13:25 let's F4 to fix the conditional
13:27 formatting on the column
13:29 let's go and apply the
13:31 format this is for the font and we want
13:35 pink okay and okay and so now we can see
13:38 the staff are highlighted let's go and
13:41 repeat that for the lecturers using a
13:43 formula and I'm just contrl + V to paste
13:45 in the one I copied from the previous
13:48 format and here we want purple this is
13:50 less than or equal to the sum of the
13:54 students and the
13:56 lecturers and again F4 to Absolute the
14:00 column only let's format it this one is
14:03 purple now this is going to apply it to
14:06 all of the we people except for the
14:08 pinons but we're going to override that
14:10 with the next rule which is for the
14:13 students so again control V to paste in
14:15 my first part of the formula and here I
14:17 just want to check that it's less than
14:20 or equal to the number of
14:22 students therefore to lock it on the
14:25 column format and this one is the this
14:28 bright blue color click okay and okay
14:31 again and then we have our survey data
14:33 visualized in we people if we go into
14:36 the conditional formatting manage rules
14:38 you can see that what's happening is
14:41 it's applying the pink format first then
14:44 the purple and then the blue so the blue
14:47 is overriding the purple so if you have
14:49 problems with displaying the conditional
14:51 format in the correct order you can
14:54 rearrange the order using these up and
14:55 down arrows
14:57 here I hope you found this tutorial
