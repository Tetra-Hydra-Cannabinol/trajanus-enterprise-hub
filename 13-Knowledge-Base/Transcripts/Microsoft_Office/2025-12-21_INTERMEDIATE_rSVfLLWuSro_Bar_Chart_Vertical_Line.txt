0:03 this is an example of a small multiples
0:05 chart it uses data from bank of americ
0:08 meril Lynch and it was originally
0:10 created in Tableau by Emily tessero I'm
0:13 going to look at how we create this same
0:15 chart in Excel and one of the challenges
0:17 in Excel is getting this vertical line
0:20 inside of a bar chart now this looks
0:22 like one chart but it's actually in
0:24 illusion it's a series of individual bar
0:27 charts and I've just stacked them close
0:29 together so they look like one my data
0:32 is on this sheet here and you'll see I
0:34 have a separate table of data for each
0:37 spend
0:38 category I've got my actual value the
0:41 maximum and the average and if we look
0:44 at the chart here the actual values are
0:46 the gray bars the maximum are green and
0:48 the average are the dash line so to
0:51 insert one of these charts I need to
0:53 select just the actual and Max first
0:55 we'll
0:56 insert a 2d bar chart I need to set this
1:00 series to overlap so we'll do that
1:03 control one to format the data series
1:05 we'll set the overlap to 100% And while
1:08 we're here let's set the Gap width to 30
1:10 it's just going to make the bars a bit
1:12 wider next we need to add the average so
1:16 I'm going to select the data including
1:18 the header contrl C select the outer
1:21 edge of the chart and then on the Home
1:23 tab I going to paste special this opens
1:26 the chart paste special dialog box we're
1:28 going to add a new series with the Y
1:30 values in the columns and the series
1:32 name is in the first row so click okay
1:36 this is our average series now the first
1:38 thing I need to do is put it on the
1:39 secondary axis now we need to make sure
1:42 these axes are set to the same size so
1:45 let's change the maximum to 2 and now
1:48 they're the same size it just make sure
1:50 that the alignment of this is correct
1:53 now I want to add a trend line to these
1:56 gray bars so we'll click the plus and I
1:59 want a linear trend
2:01 line now I'm just going to do a little
2:04 bit of formatting cuz I want to get rid
2:05 of that Legend it's taking up too much
2:07 space I don't need my horizontal
2:10 axes because I'm going to add data
2:13 labels I just want to add the data
2:15 labels to the blue Series so let's put
2:17 them inside the
2:19 base okay that'll do for now now we can
2:23 just see the trend line there I want to
2:25 hide these gray bars so control one I'm
2:29 going to set them to no fill now I can
2:32 select my trend line and let's go about
2:34 formatting that we'll make it a darker
2:35 shade of gray change the dash to a bit
2:39 wider and I want the trend line to
2:42 extend to the top and bottom of the bars
2:45 so let's make a change to the forward
2:48 forecast and make that 10 and now it
2:51 touches the top and bottom we can tidy
2:53 up the chart a little bit more let's get
2:56 rid of the grid lines cuz we've got
2:58 these labels we don't need them so I'm
3:00 just selecting them I'll press the
3:01 delete key let's format the font white
3:05 so it's easier to read and I want my
3:08 vertical axis sorted in the opposite
3:11 order as you can see in my data it
3:13 starts with Millennials and ends in
3:15 traditionalist so this is currently back
3:16 to front so I'm going to control one to
3:19 open the format access dialog box and
3:21 I'm going to choose categories in
3:23 reverse order now I can do a little bit
3:26 more formatting maybe I want my fill for
3:28 these bars to be
3:30 a gray color and let's make this one
3:33 Exel green for the
3:35 maximum all we need to do now is link
3:38 the chart title so with it selected in
3:40 the formula bar I'm going to type equals
3:43 and then choose the cell with the label
3:44 press enter and now it's linked to that
3:47 cell if I change that cell it will feed
3:49 through to my chart let's get rid of the
3:51 border on the outside of the chart so
3:53 that we can align them closer together
3:56 and I'll just make it a bit
3:58 smaller and we'll see how we go about
4:00 making the next one so basically I want
4:03 to duplicate this chart so with the
4:05 outside selected crl D to duplicate now
4:09 you can see it's selected and it's still
4:11 referencing these cells so let's just
4:13 left click and drag them all I need to
4:16 do now is I can't left click and drag
4:18 that but I can rightclick and go into
4:20 select data and I can just edit that
4:23 cell so instead of that one I want that
4:26 one and for this one instead of that one
4:29 I want that
4:30 one and average probably doesn't really
4:33 matter for the label but I like to keep
4:35 everything together I'll click okay I
4:39 just need to hide these again so let's
4:40 set them to no fill and we can set our
4:43 series colors I think there's a bug in
4:46 mine it should copy the colors but I'm
4:48 on an Insider build of XL which means
4:52 sometimes it's a little bit uh
4:54 unpredictable shall we say so let's
4:56 change that to excel Green Oh and I've
4:58 lost my data lat Labs goodness me so
5:01 we'll put
5:02 them inside the
5:06 base and we'll format that in
5:09 white and let's link this to cell
5:13 14
5:14 14 now because I want to align these
5:18 beside one another I want to reuse this
5:20 axis rather than having it repeat so
5:23 let's just hide the axis we'll turn the
5:26 labels to none and now they line side by
5:30 side let's close that I can also align
5:33 my chart title to the left just to be
5:38 consistent okay so the last thing I need
5:40 to do is give my chart a title overall
5:44 because I've got multiple charts and
5:46 create a legend cuz the legend that
5:48 comes with the chart is too noisy
5:50 particularly with the trend lines so
5:52 let's just use some shapes I need a text
5:56 box for the chart
5:58 title
6:00 and let's set the font we'll use a
6:05 light and we'll make it a bit bigger
6:08 okay so that's my chart title we'll get
6:11 rid of the border on that so that
6:14 it's not
6:16 visible okay chart title is done we just
6:20 need a legend now so I'm going to
6:24 insert a box that will represent my Max
6:27 bars so let's set that fil to green and
6:30 no
6:32 outline and we'll insert a dash
6:37 line so I'm just holding down the shift
6:39 key to make sure the line is drawn
6:41 straight so let's change the format uh
6:45 actually it's this dark gray and we want
6:48 it a bit thicker and it's annoying that
6:51 you have to keep going to this drop down
6:53 and dash line actually it looks like it
6:56 needs to be much thicker let's change it
6:58 to that one okay so now we just need to
7:01 label these and we can use a text box
7:04 for that so I'll insert another text
7:07 box this will be the
7:12 average let's make the font smaller and
7:16 the Box a bit bigger
7:19 okay we'll just align them and we'll get
7:23 rid of the
7:28 Border and we'll get rid of the
7:31 fill and I'll just copy this average box
7:34 and reuse it for the
7:39 max okay so we just need to do a little
7:42 bit of a
7:44 lining and we're done so you need to
7:47 obviously rinse and repeat this
7:49 particular chart for the rest of the
7:52 categories and then align them all
7:54 beside each other make sure that the
7:57 horizontal axis values are the same same
7:59 in each chart so that they're
8:01 consistently sized one thing you might
8:03 want to consider and it wasn't done in
8:06 Emily's original chart but notice that
8:09 this 10% bar is much bigger than this
8:11 15% bar and that's fine if you're
8:14 comparing vertical data which in this
8:16 case we are but if you wanted to compare
8:18 one chart to the next then you might
8:20 want to consider making all of the axis
8:22 lengths the same I think it's fine in
8:24 this scenario but just bear that in mind
8:26 to be consistent if you were to position
8:29 these vertically then you want to make
8:31 sure that these scales were
8:34 identical okay so that is how you insert
8:38 a vertical line in a bar chart in Excel
