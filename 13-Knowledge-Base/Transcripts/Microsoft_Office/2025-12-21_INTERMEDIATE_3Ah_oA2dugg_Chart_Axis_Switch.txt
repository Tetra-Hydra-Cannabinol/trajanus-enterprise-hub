0:00 when working with small multiple charts
0:02 or panel charts as they're also known
0:04 it's handy to be able to toggle the
0:06 chart axes between the same access for
0:08 each chart and using their own access
0:11 using the same access enables you to
0:13 compare the data between the charts
0:15 because they all use the same scale
0:18 whereas using their own axis is useful
0:20 when there are large variances from one
0:22 chart to the next which can result in
0:24 charts with lower values being difficult
0:26 to read now I've used a form control and
0:29 some sneaky formatting to create the
0:31 toggle buttons let me show you how to
0:33 set it up in this worksheet I've already
0:36 inserted four column charts and you can
0:38 see each chart is connected to its own
0:40 set of data also notice that the
0:43 vertical axis for each chart is
0:44 different and that's because Excel
0:46 automatically determines the access
0:48 minimum and maximum based on the charts
0:51 data now to create a common access scale
0:54 each chart must have the same minimum
0:56 and maximum values plotted and we do
0:58 this with what I call a ghost series
1:01 that is a series in the chart that you
1:03 can't see I'll use the Min and Max
1:05 functions for this so first of all we
1:07 want to find the minimum of each series
1:11 I'm just holding down control while I
1:13 select them that automatically inserts
1:15 the comma between each range with it
1:17 selected F2 to activate edit mode shift
1:21 and home to select the data crl C and
1:25 I'm going to press enter and then in
1:27 this cell paste in the formula and
1:29 change it to Max so there's my ghost
1:32 series values now all I need to do is
1:34 add these to my chart so with the header
1:36 selected and the two values contrl C to
1:38 copy select each chart one by one and
1:41 crl + V to paste it in you can see
1:45 instantly all four chart axes are the
1:48 same but I've got these ugly blue
1:50 columns in my chart so let's get rid of
1:52 those with the column on the first chart
1:55 selected control one to open the
1:56 formatting pane normally this would be
1:59 docked over on the right right but I've
2:00 undocked it and then we just going go
2:03 into editing and I want to choose no
2:05 fill let's repeat that for each chart
2:09 and that just hides The
2:12 Columns so you can't see them just like
2:14 a ghost hence the name okay so now we
2:18 have our ghost Series in the charts and
2:20 the axes are all the same we need to set
2:22 up a way that we can turn the same axis
2:25 setting on and off that is remove the
2:27 values for the ghost series from the
2:29 chart Al together to allow each chart to
2:31 go back to its automatic access scale to
2:34 set this up I'm going to use form
2:36 control radio buttons you'll find them
2:38 on the developer tab of the ribbon now
2:40 if you don't have the developer tab
2:41 activated or enabled you can rightclick
2:44 on the ribbon customize the
2:46 ribbon and then over here make sure
2:49 developer is
2:51 checked you'll find the radio buttons on
2:54 the insert drop-down and then up in form
2:56 controls now I want two radio buttons
2:59 and I want one to turn off when the
3:01 other is selected and vice versa so
3:03 first I need a group box to put them in
3:06 I'm just going to put them in this cell
3:08 here so holding down alt it's going to
3:10 snap to grid and let's just make sure
3:13 it's the full width so there's my group
3:16 box let's select the text in there and
3:19 delete it I don't want a name for that
3:20 group box now I'm ready to insert the
3:23 radio button here it is here select it
3:26 and then left click and drag to draw it
3:28 in and and that's the first one we're
3:30 going to call this one same
3:33 AIS and then I'll just control and left
3:36 click and then hold down shift and
3:39 control to copy copy it across left
3:42 clicking and dragging and then we're
3:43 going to change this to own
3:46 AIS so there's my two radio buttons next
3:50 thing I need to do is link them to a
3:52 cell in the worksheet so I know which
3:54 radio button is selected so right click
3:57 format
3:58 control cell link on the control tab I'm
4:01 going to pop it in here cell
4:03 W8 now because they're in a group box I
4:07 don't need to also link this one it's
4:08 automatically linked so when I select
4:10 this radio button it Returns the number
4:12 one it's the first button and this is
4:15 the second one and it Returns the number
4:17 two now I can edit the Min and Max
4:20 functions to respond to the radio button
4:23 selection so in the formula bar we're
4:25 going to change this to an if formula
4:27 that says if the r button selected
4:30 equals number two then return zero
4:34 otherwise return the minimum of all of
4:37 the charts and again we're going to say
4:41 if the radio button selected is number
4:44 two return zero otherwise return the
4:49 maximum and you can see the charts have
4:51 all reverted to their own axes because
4:54 the ghost series are now worth zero
4:57 their value is zero so essentially
4:59 they're not not affecting the axis
5:01 height when I select same axis the ghost
5:04 series values return and they're plotted
5:07 in the chart so that's how we toggle
5:10 between same axis and own axis using
5:13 these radio buttons and that's it
5:16 however radio buttons are a bit ugly
5:19 they're a super old feature and as a
5:21 result they don't have any formatting
5:23 options that said if you use the active
5:26 X control versions these do have some
5:29 limited formatting options but they also
5:31 require you to save the file as a xlsm
5:33 macro enable workbook and I try to avoid
5:36 that wherever possible because it's just
5:38 another layer of hassle requiring the
5:40 user to enable macros Etc instead I'm
5:44 going to use conditional formatting and
5:46 some shapes to make them look a bit more
5:48 modern let's do the conditional
5:50 formatting first so on the Home tab of
5:52 the ribbon with the first cell selected
5:55 for same access conditional formatting
5:58 new rule
6:01 I want to use a formula and all I'm
6:04 going to do is say where this cell
6:07 equals 1 I'm going to format the cell
6:12 fill color
6:15 yellow so let's select it so the
6:18 conditional formatting is working let's
6:20 set it up for this one as well again new
6:23 rule using a formula where this cell
6:27 equals 2 going to format of
6:31 yellow Let's test it so that's working
6:36 nicely now unfortunately I can't get rid
6:38 of the group box outline and I can't
6:41 change the fonts or anything else to do
6:43 with the radio buttons but I can kind of
6:45 hide it and I do that with a shape so
6:47 let's grab this rectangle with the round
6:49 the corners and I'm just going to hold
6:52 down alt which is going to snap the
6:54 rectangle to the grid to the cell I'm
6:56 going to round the corners a bit more
6:58 dragging the yellow butt Buton and then
7:00 I don't want any fill but I do want a
7:03 white
7:05 outline and I want to make the outline
7:07 quite thick so we're going to go six
7:09 point and that's just going to create
7:12 the rounded edges we need to make it a
7:14 little bit bigger to hide the group box
7:17 so just play around with that until you
7:20 get it just
7:22 right you might need to make the outline
7:24 slightly
7:25 wider that seems to have worked so now
7:27 with it's selected I'm just going to
7:29 done control and shift left click and
7:31 drag it across to the other one let's
7:34 select it we might need to do some
7:36 tweaking on the position of the shape
7:40 and likewise for this
7:42 one there we go so you can play around
7:45 it with it a bit more you might need to
7:46 move your radio button to center it a
7:48 bit more so there you have radio buttons
7:52 that toggle the chart axis between each
7:55 chart's own axis Heights versus the same
7:59 AIS across all
8:01 charts I hope you like this video and
8:04 have some ideas where you can use these
8:05 techniques yourself you can download the
