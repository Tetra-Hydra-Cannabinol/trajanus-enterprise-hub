0:00 there's no built-in way we can force
0:02 Excel slices to single select but we can
0:05 use some crafty tricks to prompt users
0:07 to only select one item for example we
0:09 can change the chart title to display a
0:12 message when more than one item is
0:13 selected in the slicer and in regular
0:16 charts we can also hide the data now
0:19 there's a different technique for pivot
0:20 charts versus regular charts and I'll
0:22 cover both options in this video I'll
0:26 start with regular charts that reference
0:28 data from a pivot table linked to SL es
0:30 here I'm going to change the chart title
0:32 to show the user a message and I'm going
0:35 to hide the data in the chart when they
0:36 select more than one item in the Slicer
0:39 in columns D and H I've got my data and
0:42 if you look in the formula bar you can
0:44 see it's simply picking up the data from
0:46 the pivot table in columns q and R now
0:49 you might be wondering why I haven't
0:50 just used a pivot chart but sometimes
0:52 pivot charts are too restrictive and
0:54 when this happens we use this workaround
0:56 to create a regular chart that
0:58 indirectly references the pivot table
1:00 data allowing us to still use the slicer
1:03 for
1:04 filtering let's start by inserting a
1:07 line chart and I'll just pop it up here
1:11 and I want a slicer for the category so
1:13 with the pivot table selected right
1:15 click the filled and add a slicer I'll
1:19 bring that up beside the
1:21 chart now I need to detect how many
1:23 items are selected in the slicer and I
1:25 don't have the category information in
1:27 this pivot table I'm going to just copy
1:30 this pivot table I'll paste it in here
1:32 and we'll modify it so that it only
1:34 contains the category in the row labels
1:38 Now by copying this pivot table that
1:40 already has the slicer linked to it the
1:43 slicer is also linked to this pivot
1:45 table here you can control which pivot
1:47 tables the slicers are connected to by
1:49 right clicking on the slicer report
1:52 connections and then in here check the
1:55 box for the pivot tables that you want
1:57 it connected to so in this case it's
1:59 pivot table 10 and five and now when I
2:02 select an item in the slicer you can see
2:05 the pivot table here tells me what's
2:06 selected and if I select more than one
2:09 we can see the list reflects what I've
2:11 selected the first thing I need to do is
2:14 check if this second row in the pivot
2:16 table is empty if it's not empty then I
2:19 know the user has selected too many
2:21 items and I'm going to create a dynamic
2:24 label that I'm going to link to the
2:26 Chart title that sends the user a
2:29 message when they've selected more than
2:31 one item in the slicer we can use an if
2:34 formula that says if cell j8 is blank
2:38 then return the name of the item
2:40 selected in the slicer and concatenate
2:43 the text actual sales cuz this data
2:45 represents my actual
2:47 sales and if j8 is not blank we're going
2:50 to return the message please choose only
2:52 one
2:54 category the is blank function Returns
2:57 the Boolean values true or false now now
2:59 another way you can test if the cell is
3:01 blank is simply to reference it and
3:04 check if it equals two double quotes
3:07 which is the equivalent of blank so we
3:09 get the same result with either of those
3:12 it's up to you which one you prefer to
3:13 use right let me delete those and let's
3:16 link this label to the Chart title so
3:19 I'm going to select the box for the
3:20 chart title with it selected in the
3:23 formula bar type equals and then select
3:26 the cell that contains your Dynamic
3:28 label and press enter and now I can
3:31 simply choose one item and it updates to
3:34 reflect the name of the item I've
3:37 selected if I select too
3:40 many it gives me the error but what if
3:43 the user doesn't notice this message
3:45 well we can also hide the data in the
3:47 chart using a similar technique all I
3:50 need to do here is ADD times is blank
3:53 select cell j8 F4 to Absolute it and
3:58 then press enter now when you perform a
4:00 math operation on a Boolean true or
4:02 false value which is what's being
4:04 returned by is blank here and we can see
4:06 that if I press F9 Excel will convert
4:09 the true and false to their numeric
4:11 equivalents false is the equivalent of
4:13 zero and true is the equivalent of one
4:17 so when we multiply anything by zero we
4:19 get a load of zeros and now our chart
4:21 has lost all its data but the minute the
4:24 user selects just one category the data
4:27 comes
4:28 back with pivot charts we can't hide the
4:31 line in the chart so we need to get a
4:33 bit more in your face with our message
4:36 let's take a look here I've already got
4:38 the pivot table for my chart and the Dy
4:40 pivot table for the slicer selection and
4:43 the slicer is connected to both pivot
4:45 tables so I'm going to insert a pivot
4:48 chart again I'm just going to pop a line
4:50 chart in and we'll move it over here
4:54 let's get rid of these field buttons and
4:56 we don't need the
4:58 legend again I need to create a dynamic
5:01 label that checks if the second row of
5:03 the dummy pivot table is blank if it is
5:06 then return the label containing the
5:08 selected item and the text actual sales
5:11 otherwise return
5:14 blank now when I select one item we get
5:17 the label if I have more than one
5:19 selected the label's gone so all I need
5:22 to do is link the chart title again to
5:25 the dynamic label so with it selected
5:28 type in equals select the cell
5:30 containing the label and press enter if
5:33 I select more than one item the label's
5:35 gone now the reason I want the blank
5:38 title returned if the user selects too
5:40 many items in the slicer is so that I
5:42 can show another message in the chart
5:44 that's red and bold and I can't
5:47 conditionally format the chart title so
5:49 I'm going to use another cell in the
5:50 worksheet that sits behind the chart
5:53 first I need to remove the fill color
5:55 for the chart so with it's selected on
5:57 the format tab shape fill and I want no
6:00 fill and now I can select the cell
6:03 behind the chart so let's just pop it in
6:06 cell C50 here and again we're going to
6:09 use another if formula that simply says
6:12 if cell j52 is blank then return blank
6:16 otherwise return please only choose one
6:19 category in the
6:20 slicer we can do a little bit of
6:22 formatting let's indent it make it red
6:25 and bold so that our users can't
6:27 possibly miss it now when I select one
6:30 item our chart displays correctly if I
6:33 select more than one the user sees the
6:36 error now I can't hide the line but
6:38 hopefully they can't miss that message
6:40 now we can also help the user correctly
6:43 select just one item by formatting the
6:45 header in the slicer so right click
6:48 slicer settings and then in here we can
6:51 say select one
6:56 category well I hope you found this
6:58 technique useful you can download the
