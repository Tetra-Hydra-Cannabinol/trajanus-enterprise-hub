Neutralinojs versus Election. Which is
better? In this video, let me show you a
comparison of Neutralinojs and Election.
Starting with Neutralinojs.
It's a liveweight open-source framework
that doesn't bundle a full Chromium
browser. Instead, it uses your systems
default web engine. It is also easy to
set up though it offers limited API
support and less stability on some
advanced features since it relies on a
system browser. UI rendering may vary
between platforms. Now for election this
is a fullfeatured framework used by big
apps like VS Code, Discord and Slack. It
combines Chromium and Node.js
giving you deep access to both web and
system APIs. It's great for complex apps
which rich documentation and plug-in
support. In short, in short, go with
neutral nojs if you need something
lightweight and simple. Choose election
for featurerich apps that need full
system integration.
