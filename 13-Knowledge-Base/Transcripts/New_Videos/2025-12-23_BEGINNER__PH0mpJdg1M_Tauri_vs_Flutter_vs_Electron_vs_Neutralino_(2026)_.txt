In this video, we're comparing Tari,
Flutter, Electron, and Neutralino. Four
popular frameworks for building
cross-platform desktop apps. These tools
all let developers write one codebase
and ship to Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
But their performance, memory footprint,
and developer experience differ
dramatically.
Let's see which one feels the fastest,
the lightest, and the most practical
going into 2026.
Starting with Tari, this Rust based
framework has surged in popularity
because it keeps things lightweight.
Instead of bundling Chromium like
Electron, it wraps your app in the
systems native web view, often cutting
app sizes to under 10 megabytes. In real
benchmarks, Tari's memory usage can be 5
to 10 times lower than Electrons for
equivalent apps. That's partially
because tar's backend runs in Rust,
eliminating the node.es runtime
overhead. But performance can depend on
the native web view quality on older
Windows builds or Linux distros. Some
users report slower rendering or
inconsistent behavior compared to Mac
OS. Security conscious teams like Tari
because its Rust code prevents memory
leaks and sandboxing is rigorous. The
learning curve, however, is steeper,
especially if you're not familiar with
Rust tooling, and hot reload setups
aren't as mature as Flutters or
Electrons. Next up, Flutter Desktop.
While originally built for mobile,
Flutter has become increasingly solid
for desktop in 2025.
It compiles to native machine code with
Dart, and on benchmark tests, UI
rendering is impressively stable at 120
frames per second with near zero frame
jank. The key advantage is pixel perfect
control. Your UI looks the same across
systems because it draws directly using
Skia rather than relying on web views.
That's a double-edged sword, though.
Apps tend to be larger, and access to
system native menus, file dialogues, or
tray integration still feels a bit
bolted on. The ecosystem is rich, but
some plugins simply don't translate well
from mobile. Developers on Reddit often
mention that while Flutter desktop apps
feel smooth, they consume more CPU
sitting idle than Tari or Neutralino
builds, likely due to its rendering
engine constantly redrawing elements.
Electron, the veteran in this space,
remains the most mature and feature
option thanks to its deep node.js and
Chromium integration. Apps like VS Code
and Slack still prove its reliability.
The downside is wellknown resource
usage.
Running a Chromium instance for every
window means even a small Electron app
can consume hundreds of megabytes of
RAM.
That said, optimizations like context
sharing and code splitting can mitigate
this. Many production teams keep using
Electron because of its predictable
packaging pipeline, vast npm ecosystem,
and consistent cross-platform behavior.
In contrast, Neutralino takes a
minimalist approach. Think of it as
Toriite. It avoids shipping Chromium,
producing binaries under 5 megabytes,
but lacks Tar's security features and
still suffers from limited native API
coverage. Some developers on Hacker News
note that Neutralino can feel fragile in
heavyduty apps, especially those
requiring native menus or advanced
integrations.
So, which one wins for sheer
performance? Tari leads its Rust core
and use of native web views make it feel
snappy and memory efficient. Flutter
offers unmatched design consistency and
buttery rendering. Perfect for UI heavy
apps or startups already using Flutter
for mobile. Electron remains the most
dependable for large scale plug-in rich
ecosystems while Neutralino fits
ultraight hobby level projects. Your
choice depends on what you trade. Speed,
control, ecosystem, or complexity. If
performance and efficiency top your
list, Tori is the one to watch in 2026.
