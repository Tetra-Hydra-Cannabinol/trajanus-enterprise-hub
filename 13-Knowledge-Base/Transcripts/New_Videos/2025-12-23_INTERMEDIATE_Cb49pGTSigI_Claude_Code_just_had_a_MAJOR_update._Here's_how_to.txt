Over the past month, Anthropic has
released a ton of secret updates to
Claude Code that you would only find out
about if you were following specific
Twitter accounts. In this video, I'm
going to go over all those secret
updates that you probably missed that
will completely change how you use
Claude Code and make it way better. If
you use Claude Code, this is going to be
the most important video you watch this
month. I promise you whether you're a
beginner or a pro, you will be using
Claude Code completely differently after
these 10 updates. Let's get into it. So,
this one is a great one and that is the
ability to resume past Claude Code
sessions. If you're anything like me,
you've had tons of conversations with
Claude Code that has context you don't
want to miss out on. You reset your
computer and all that context
disappears. Well, no more. If you type
into your terminal claude dashres,
hit enter, it will bring up all your
past sessions you had with Claude Code
for the project you're working on. So,
for the sake of demonstration this
video, I'm going to show you this
project management tool I'm building out
right now that helps you manage all my
projects in Claude Code. So, I have all
my past sessions here that I've had with
Claude. So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to hit resume on my past session.
And all the context I had and all the
conversation I had from that session is
now completely resumed. So, now I don't
have to go back and fill in clawed code
with all the past context every time I
reset my computer or my Visual Studio
Code. This is massive and this is going
to make it so much easier to get back
into past conversations you have and not
miss out on any of the context you had
before. I put the command to resume your
sessions down below in the description.
All the commands and all the changes I
go over will be down in the description
below. So, feel free to pause and copy
and paste that into like your Apple
notes. Okay. So, say we resumed our past
session and there's a ton of context in
there. When you get a lot of context
into Claude code and starts filling up
your window, it actually can make Claude
hallucinate a lot more than it does
before. I hear a lot of people on X
complain right now, oh, Claude's getting
worse. No, that's a skill issue. they're
just not managing their context well.
But how do you manage your context
better if you start seeing worse
performance with claude? What you want
to do is use their brand new slash
command slashcontext. This is going to
help you visualize what is currently in
your context right now. So I'm going to
run that and again slashcontext I'll put
down below and you'll be able to see
here now in this really nice
visualization what is taking up your
entire context window. So you can see
here the system prompt is taking up a
good amount of context. That's because I
have a ton of clawed rules. All the
tools we're using, the messages we've
done so far. This is actually taking up
the most context with 32% is the past
messages. So, if I wanted to free up
context right now, I would just go in
here and I would do slashclear. And that
would clear the message history since
right now it's taking up the most
context. So, if you start to see
degraded performance in Claude, do
slashcontext. See what's taking up all
the space. Maybe it's your system
message. Maybe it's your past messages
in the conversation and then you can
take care of it from there. If it's the
past messages, just do slash clear just
like I did here. Which takes me to the
next big update that they released in
the last few weeks and that is slash
stats. It's another brand new slash
command. So, one of the biggest
complaints I hear about Claude as well
is people don't know how many tokens
they've used up at their plan. Are they
getting to the end of their plan? Are
they going to have to upgrade to a more
expensive plan? Well, now you'll be able
to see exactly how much usage you've had
in your plan. If you do slashstats, it
will show you all your usage for that
time period. You can see all your
interesting stats here. How many tokens
you've used, so are you getting to your
limit on tokens, your streaks, how many
sessions you've had, your active days,
your peak hours. You can even hit tab
and see the different models you've been
using. As you can see, once Opus
dropped, it was game over. I was using
Opus tremendously more. So you can see a
lot of your usage here, how many tokens
you've used and if you're getting up to
your current limits and if you need to
upgrade or not. Slash stats, keep tabs
on that. It's also just fun to see your
numbers and see how much you're using
Claude and which models you're using. If
you run slash stats right now, let me
know down below what your usage looks
like. How many days in a row have you
used Claude Code? I'd be really curious
to see. So a second ago, we were talking
about resuming sessions. This is
something you need to be doing often
because if you're anything like me,
you're also doing multiple sessions at
once. I like to have multiple claude
codes open so I can work on different
features at the same time. Well, one
really awesome thing they just added in
their recent holiday updates is the
ability to actually name sessions so
that when you resume old sessions, like
I showed you at the beginning of this
video, you can see very clearly what you
were doing in each session because you
can give it those custom names. All you
need to do to name your sessions is do
slash rename and then give it a name for
your session. So for this one, I was
working on the cananban board of our
project management. So I'm going to call
it cananban and I'm going to hit enter.
And now our session is now called
cananban. So if I go to a new terminal
here and I do claude slashres
and hit enter, we can see our new name
session canband that we were using just
a second ago with all 246 messages. So,
this is really important to do if you're
doing multiple sessions, which I think
you should be doing. When you're waiting
for one session to build out a feature,
it's really good not to get distracted,
not to look at Tik Tok. Open up another
session, start working on another
feature. Make sure to give it its own
name with slashreame. And again, all
these slash commands, all these updates
down below in the description so you
don't have to forget any of these. The
next update they made is great if you
often make mistakes when working with
cloud code. This is something I do a
lot. I do a lot of experimentation. I
have a change around features to see how
it works and sometimes I mess up and I
give it a bad command. So, for instance,
in this project management tool, I want
to experiment with the colors and notes.
I made it blue. I don't like the blue.
It's not really standing out against the
black background. So, let's rewind this.
In a brand new update to Claude Code
they just released, you can now rewind
super easily any changes you made that
were mistakes. You do this by hitting
escape twice. Double escape and it goes
back and it gives you these rewind
options. And what I can do is I can go
back and I can say rewind to the rename
canban which was one step before the
changing of the colors of the notes. I'm
going to hit enter on that and I'm going
to say restore the code and the
conversation. So it's going to forget
any of the conversation after and it's
going to restore all the code and I'm
going to hit enter and boom just like
that we are back and it's at the rename
canban and I can hit enter on that and
we are back to that one step before
changing all the colors to blue. This is
amazing. If you make mistakes often, if
you experiment, you should be
experimenting a ton ever since they
released this double escape feature.
It's given me a lot more freedom to try
new things. So, double escape, an
awesome way to rewind if you make any
mistakes at all. The next update is a
big one and it brings back a much loved
feature that's kind of been experimented
with, taken out, put back in. Well, it's
fully back. Ultra Think is totally back
into Claude Code and you need to be
using it. What Ultra Think is is the
ability to force Claude code to work
extra hard on tough problems. And I've
been using this a lot and let me tell
you, you get way better results when
using Ultra Think. So, as you can see
here, I want to add a calendar to our
app. I want it to be beautiful. I want
Claude to work extra hard on it. So, I
said add a beautiful calendar section to
our app using the design skill. Ultra
think about this. And for the record, if
you don't have the design skill yet,
I'll put a link down below. You need to
install the Claw design skill. I'm
thinking about doing an entire video
dedicated to Claude skills. If you want
that, let me know down in the replies as
well. But the key here is I said Ultra
Think and as you can see, they put it in
like the rainbow colors. All you need to
do in any of your messages is type the
term Ultraink and it will force Claude
Code to think very very hard about what
it's doing and put more effort in the
creation. Hitting enter on that will
start the process and it is going to
make sure that this calendar looks way
better than it would before. I wouldn't
use ultrathink on every single prompt
you do. It's going to take a lot longer
and you're probably going to burn a lot
more tokens than you need to. But any
prompts you give where you're doing a
complex task or you're solving a complex
bug, I would 100% use Ultraink because
you're going to get noticeably better
results. This is a really good feature
to use when you're kind of building out
the base of your app after the first
planning phase because you're going to
get a way better base to your app. Use
Ultra Think again down below in
description. The next big feature they
released over these last few weeks that
I absolutely loved is the ability to
create custom memories. So before
anytime you wanted Claude to remember
something, you had to go into your
Clawude rules and put it there. But that
could be challenging at times. I don't
always remember to put things into
Claude rules or claude rules can get
very crowded and disorganized if you're
adding a ton in there. So what I like to
do when I have small things I want
Claude to remember in its process is to
create custom memories for it. So for
instance, I want Claude to use the
design skill anytime it changes the UI.
And I wanted to remember that for the
rest of time that I'm working on this
app. So what you want to do to create
custom memories for Claude is you're
going to do the hashtag which changes
you to memory mode. So you can say add
to memory and then we're going to say
always use the design skill when
changing the UI. And then I'm going to
hit enter. And now it's going to
memorize this. I want to put it into the
project memory. So you can do user
memory or project memory. I want it to
remember it just for this project. I'm
going to hit enter there. And now
anytime we change the UI in this
project, it is going to use that design
skill. I actually highly recommend you
copy exactly what I just did. Now, go
pause this video, go into Claude Code,
do hashtag, and then type in use the
design skill anytime you change the UI
because the design skill is so freaking
good. It's going to make your app look
so much better. So, custom memories.
Anytime you want Claude to remember
something that does every single time in
its process, make sure to use custom
memories. I highly recommend you do the
design skill memory I just did and you
can use it moving forward. This next
update is a tip for the risktakers out
there, but this is putting Claude into
YOLO mode. This is the mode it goes into
when you don't want to ask you for
permission anymore. I'm going to be
completely honest with you. Claude for
me hasn't made mistakes in months. And I
know that might sound crazy, but when
you get so used to Claude code that you
know how it works, you know how it
operates, you know how to talk to it,
you really don't mess up with anymore.
Opus 45 has gotten so smart. I don't
mess up. So, I like to use yolo mode.
And the way to do that is you put in
this command claude-dangerously
skip permissions. And then you hit enter
on that. And that's going to put Claude
in yolo mode. I'm going to hit accept on
this. I would only recommend using this.
If you are super used to claude codes,
if you're on the pro side of Claude
code, I would do this. This saves me a
ton of time. I like to give Claude
longunning tasks where I can hit enter
and walk away and I don't have to keep
hitting accept except accept over and
over again. This allows me to just do
that and treat Claude as an independent
employee. I put the command down below.
If you're Claude pro, copy that. If
you're an amateur or you're a beginner,
I'd say spend a month or two getting
used to Opus and how it works and the
right prompts to give it. And then when
you're comfortable, you can use this
command. I'll put that down below.
Claude yolo mode. Really, really helpful
for saving time. The next big update,
and this is a huge one, basically adds
an entire app store to Claude Code, is
slashplugins. If you do slashplugins,
hit enter. You now have an entire
basically store of skills and plugins
and MCPs you can put right into Claude
Code very, very easily. I would highly
recommend if you haven't yet, go in
here, do slashplugins, and go down to
front-end design. This is the plugin you
need if you're building any sort of app.
my UIs with my apps I built are a
thousand times better because of this
skill. So if you haven't installed this
yet, do slashplugins, go and discover,
go down to front-end design and install
that. But there's so many other ones. If
you use GitHub a ton, if you use any of
these others, Figma, linear, notion, you
have a ton of plugins and MCPs you can
get installed with one click that will
make it so much easier to work between
all your different tools. I couldn't
recommend enough. check out the plug-in
store and see if you use any of these
integrations inside the plug-in store.
At the very least, get the front-end
design skill installed. The last update
we'll go over here is saving your
prompts. If you're anything like me, you
come up with an idea, you write a prompt
out, and then right before you hit
enter, you realize you need to do
something else right before you send
that prompt, and you sit there and you
hold backspace for five minutes while it
deletes your prompt. You don't have to
do that anymore. Say you write out a
prompt. I want you to build out a
calendar and I realize I need to do
something else first. You can now hit
CtrlS. That will stash your prompt. And
now after I say something like add a
light mode to the app and hit enter, it
will take my stash prompt and put it
back into the line here so I can send it
after. No more sitting there and hitting
backspace for five minutes at a time to
get rid of your prompts. Now you can
just stash your prompt, go in, write
whatever else you need to do, and then
your stash prompt will then
automatically be placed inside your
command line so you can use it again.
This has saved me so much time. I will
put that down below as well. S to stash
your prompt. Those were the big changes
from the last month and they're adding a
ton more as we speak. They've been
adding new ones every single day. I'm
going to keep an eye on them. I'm going
to create more follow-up videos over the
next few weeks going over all the
additional changes they're coming out
with. Make sure to stay on top of this
