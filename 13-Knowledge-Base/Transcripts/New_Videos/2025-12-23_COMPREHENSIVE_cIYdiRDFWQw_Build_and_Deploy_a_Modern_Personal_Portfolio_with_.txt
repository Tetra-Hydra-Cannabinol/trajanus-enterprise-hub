Most people either over complicate their
personal portfolios with huge frameworks
and fancy libraries or they keep
postponing it because they don't think
their skills are good enough yet. And
that's a problem because your portfolio
is often the first thing recruiters,
clients, and hiring managers look at.
Today, I'm going to show you how to
build a beautiful modern personal
portfolio using just React and Tailwind
CSS. No unnecessary bloat and no magic
libraries you don't understand. We'll
build everything from scratch. A
stunning hero section, an about section,
a place where you can display all your
best projects, a beautiful experience
timeline, a testimonials carousel, and a
fully working contact section so that
recruiters can reach out to you. But
this isn't just an UI build. Along the
way, you'll learn how to structure a
realworld React app, style it cleanly
with Tailwind, and bring it to life with
pure CSS animations that feel smooth and
professional. By the end of the video,
you'll have a portfolio you can actually
deploy, customize, and be proud to share
and a much stronger understanding of how
React and Tailwind work together in real
projects. Before we get into the video,

ReactJS Ultra course for beginners.
Okay, everyone. To get started, what I
want to do is I want to create a folder
inside of my computer. I'm going to call
it dev personal portfolio. Then what I
want to do is I want to copy like just
drag and drop it inside of my code
editor of choice. Now I'm using VS Code
for this video. However, feel free to
use any code editor that you want. Now
we have to set up our React project. To
do that, we're going to be using one of
the most popular bundlers out there for
React, which is VIT. Now VIT is the
standard way of creating your React apps
in today's day and age. Back in the day,
you would use something like create
react app. But I highly recommend that
you use either VIT or if you're building
something like an XJ.js app, you use the
create next app command. Now for Vit,
what we need to do is run npx create
VIT. And then let's install the latest
version of Vit. So I already have the
latest version. It didn't ask me to
install anything, but if you don't have
it, it's going to ask you to uh install
the create V command. Now, we need to
give a name to this project. However,
this name that over here is just going
to be the name of the folder in which
the project is going to be created in.
Now, we are already inside of a pro a
folder that I created for this project.
So, I don't really want to create
another folder and put the project
there. So, to bypass that and make the
project just be built on the folder that
we already made, I'm just going to give
the name of dot so that it creates it
inside of here. Then it asks us to
create the framework. Now, vit isn't
just for React. You can create u
projects with a bunch of different
frameworks, but in our case, we are
choosing React. So, I'll choose that
option and press enter. We're building
this in JavaScript and we're only
building this in JavaScript because I
want to make it accessible for everyone,
even if you don't know TypeScript. But
if you are building a React project, I
highly recommend that you eventually do
learn TypeScript and I do have a video
for that as well. Now, I'm going to
choose use rolldown VIT because it's an
experimental feature that eventually is
going to be default in all VIT projects.
It's just supposed to make your projects
run and build faster. I'm going to
choose that and then I'm going to choose
yes to install npm and start. Now, this
is going to create all the files and
folders in our project and it's going to
install all the dependencies. Now, the
project is running and I opened it up
inside of my web browser with uh by
going to the URL localhost 5173 which is
the port where every Vita application
runs in. So, now let's get started. The
first thing I want to do is I want to
install the necessary dependencies that
we're going to have in this project. So
I'm going to open up another tab on my
terminal and I want to install uh first
Tailwind CSS. To do that I'm going to
run npm install and then I'll install
the base Tailwind CSS package but also I
need to install the plugin for VIT. To
do that I'm going to install the package
at Tailwind CSS or /vit. Perfect. Now to
set up Tailwind CSS in your project, I'm
going to come over here to our Vit
config. And the first thing I want to do
here is I want to import from the at
Tailwind CSS/V package. I want to import
I want to import uh not from this curly
braces just like this. The Tailwind CSS
plugin and I need to add it to the end
here of the list and call it. If this
isn't added, then your Tailwind project
won't be configured with uh your your V
project won't be configured with
Tailwind. Now, another thing I want to
do is I want to change how we import
packages. If you go into the project
right here, you'll see that when you
want to import something like a file or
a logo like we're doing over here, you
have to specify directly the path to
that file. Right here, we're importing
the React logo, which is just a SVG in
the assets folder. And I have to
directly put here the path towards that.
Now instead I want to actually set a
default path where every time I I put
this on my import where I do like this
import at this takes me back to the root
so that I can always just quickly access
the root of all my imports. You'll see
how useful that is. And to do that we
have to import path from path. And then
in our uh define config over here I need
to set a resolve and then an alias. And
we can set the alias to be the at
symbol. And we basically set the path to
always resolve to the directory name at
dot / src. I always do this in my react
projects with vit so that I can easily
import it. If you're familiar with
something like this is how they do it by
default. So now we can close this up and
we can go to our app.tcsS. I'm going to
delete this file. We don't need this.
We're going to do all of our CSS stuff
on our index.css over here. Then I want
to delete all of this as well. And I
want to import at the top over here.
Tailwind CSS. This is a crucial line
that you need to put. If you don't put
this on your index.css file, none of
your Tailwind will actually work.
Because I also deleted my app.t CSS, I'm
going to come to the app.jsx JSX and I
want to delete that import over here
together with actually everything that
we have. I'm going to delete and make
this component be completely empty so
that we have a clean slate to build our
project. Now to get started I want to
just set up a bit of how our Tailwind
infrastructure is going to look like.
And the first thing I want to do is I
want to define some custom colors for
our project. Now what does that mean?
Well, it means that throughout our
project, we're going to have a bunch of
different text. And those texts are
going to have different colors. Not just
text, but also different uh parts of it
like backgrounds, even like border
radiuses that we want to maintain
consistent and are not things that
already come with Tailwind. Like the
green color we're going to have for the
text that you saw in the demo, that's
not a custom like that's not a a default
color in Tailwind. So, we're going to
have to create a color for ourselves. To
define custom colors that you want to
reuse, you just use the add theme at the
top over here and then define the colors
by adding double uh hyphens adding the
word color and then defining the name of
the color. For example, the background
of our website is going to have a very
specific color and we're going to be
reusing this multiple times. It's going
to be this hexadimal over here. Now,
every time we now use the color named
background and you'll see us doing this,
it is going to use this color. Now
there's other ones that we want to do as
well. For example, I want to define one
for foreground. Now what does foreground
means? It means like for example uh the
text that goes in front of the
background should be white. So usually
the the foreground color is the opposite
uh in the color spectrum from the
background. And I applied this version
of white over here. Now there's a bunch
of other colors we want to define. For
example, we're going to have a bunch of
cards in this project. And I defined
this color for a card. Now we are going
to I'm just going to copy and paste all
of the remaining colors that we want to
have in our project. And if you want to
write one by one, you can just write
them or you can just copy it from the
code in the description. This is all we
have to do. We defined a bunch of colors
and also we defined a radius that we're
going to be using multiple times in this
project as well. Just for whenever we
want to apply a border radius, we'll
just use this. Now what I want to do is
I want to come here and I want to define
the base layer of our project. Now this
is just going to be some of the initial
elements that are by default part of the
website. For example, uh everywhere in
the in the HTML part of the website, I
want to set a scroll behavior to be
smooth. This is because we're going to
have a bunch of scrolling through uh the
different pages when you navigate
through the navbar. And I want to set
that to be the scroll behavior. Also,
I'm going to define the body. Now, we're
not going to make a lot of uh CSS
changes directly from here. Most of it
is actually going to be part of
Tailwind, right? However, some of the
stuff like the background color of the
entire website and the general color of
text, I can just define it over here.
We're also going to define some stuff
like the font that we're going to be
using for this project. To define the
overall background color that we want to
use, I'm going to set a background
color. And I want to actually use the
background color that we have over here.
To do that, I can use a var function
that allows me to copy the name of this
uh variable that we created over here
and put it inside of here. Now, you see
that the entire website changes that
color. We're going to do the same thing
for the text color and also for the font
family. The text color, I set it to
color foreground to make the text be
white. And then for the font family, uh
it's not a variable. It's just the font
that we're going to be using in this
website. Now there are different parts
of the website that uses a different
font. There's a specific part where we
want to use the playfair display font.
So I want to create a class called font
serif because it's a serif font. And
whenever I call this class I'm going to
be changing the text to use this font.
I'll specify when we're doing this. Now
we're pretty much done with the basis of
our CSS. And what I want to do is I want
to come to our app.jsx and start
defining the structure of the website.
So to start things off, I want to change
this to actually utilize a div. And on
this div, I want to apply a couple base
classes. The first thing is I want to
apply a minimum height that is the
height of the screen. So no matter which
page we're in, at least the height of
the layout is going to be the total
height of whatever your screen size is.
Then I want to apply an over then I want
to apply an overflow in the X direction
to be hidden. Then I want to define the
structure of where we have the navbar at
the top and all of the sequential
sections. So to do that I'll call here a
component we haven't created called
navbar. And below this I want to have a
main tag that will call all of the other
components that represent the different
sections. For the navbar let's create
that component. To do that I'll create
here a folder called layout. Now why is
that? Well, I'm going to have a couple
components that are specific to the
layout of the website, like the navbar,
the footer, and so on. And I'll put them
in this folder because they are specific
for that. We're also going to have
another folder called sections, which
will represent the different sections in
our project. Now, for the layout, I'll
create here a navbar.jsx,
and I'm going to export a constant
called navbar, and I'm going to set it
equal to a component function. Then I'll
return a header tag which for now should
remain like that. Then I want to start
by building the components and files for
the different sections. Now what are the
different sections we're going to have?
Well, the first one is going to be the
hero section, right? It's the first
thing that shows up in the page. So
we're going to create this and I'm going
to copy what we have here for navbar.
Paste it here and then just change the
name of the component. Also, for all of
the sections, this will pretty much be a
section tag. We're going to use the very
specific HTML tags to define each part
so that we can keep everything
organized. Then I'm going to duplicate
this file and I'm going to create the
next section. The next section is going
to be the about section. So, we'll
create an about file. Change this to
about. We'll do the same thing now with
the experience. So, we'll change this to
say experience. We'll copy again. We're
going to create a projects section and
I'll change this to say projects. And
then I'll copy again and I'll make the
testimonials section. And I think that
should be pretty much it. We just need
one more actually. And I need to change
the testimonials to say testimonials
instead of project. So testimonials.
And then on the testimonials copy, which
is the copy we made, we're going to put
the contact section. And then just
change this to say contact. Perfect. Now
I'll close all of these files because we
don't need them open anymore. But we
have all of the components created and
files created for the different
sections. Now we are not adding anything
inside of them. But at least we have
them set up. So we can just set up the
structure. Now what is this structure?
Well, we're going to have at the top the
navbar. And then inside of this main tag
and then inside of this main tag we're
going to have the different sections.
First it's going to be the hero section.
Did we just call it hero? Let me make
sure. Yeah, we just called it hero. Now
to import. Now to import this, I'm going
to come over here at the top and I'm
going to say import from. Then I'm going
to use the at symbol slash and I'm going
to go into the sections slashh hero. Now
because we set up the at as the path,
I'll be able to import the hero
component from here. You see that if I
come here and I were to write something.
Now if you come here to the hero section
and I just write something, it should
appear over here. But it doesn't. And
that's actually because we are not
importing the nav bar. So it's giving us
an error. But if I change that, you see
that it does. And that's why we you we
change the ad symbol. So we don't have
to, you know, put a bunch of dots over
here to move back to this specific path.
The ad symbol represents starting off in
the source folder. So I just go to the
sections folder and then to this
specific file. Perfect. Now I'm going to
do the exact same thing for all of the
other components. I'll just copy them,
paste it over here, then change it. For
example, the second one's going to be
the about. The third one is going to be
the projects and so on. And then I'll be
back in a second. Perfect. As you can
see, I just set up all of them. And I
imported all of the correct files. And
now we're good to go. I want to start
off by building the navbar. It's always
what I start with because it helps set
up the rest of the website. Now, to
start things off, I want to set up the
infrastructure inside of this navbar.
We're going to have a nav section over
here that is going to contain a logo on
the left and also a button on the right.
Now, this is depends if we're in desktop
mode or in mobile mode. So, to start
off, we're going to do it in desktop
mode. So, in desktop mode, we're going
to have here the logo on the side and
also all the links appearing in the
middle. So, we got to start off by doing
the following. Inside of this nav tag,
I'm going to put in a tag that is going
to have the logo, which in my case is
just going to be my initials, PM. And
then I'm going to add a spin that is
going to have a dot. Now, we're going to
obviously add styling to them. It should
look a bit like this. We're going to
make it bigger, but for now, it that
that's good enough. Then, what I want to
do is I want to set up the other side of
this, which is the side where we're
going to have all the different
navigation links. So I'm going to create
here a div and I'm going to add a
comment above here because this is going
to be the desktop nav. Then inside of
this we're going to have another div and
we want to define a list at the top
where it's going to contain all of the
different links we want to use for
navigation. Now to do that I'm going to
create here the nav links list and
inside of it it's going to be an object.
That object will contain two things. An
href which is basically where do you
want to take the user when they click on
this link. And we're going to do one for
each individual section. The first one
is going to be to the about section. And
then a label. The label is going to be
used for just what it's displayed as a
text on the navbar. So I'm just going to
write about with a capital A. Then we
want to do this for all the other links
as well. We're going to have one for
projects, one for experience, and one
for testimonials. Then we get this list
and we loop through it so that we can
show each link. To do that, I'm going to
grab here the nav links. I'm gonna map
it and for each link I'm going to render
a an A tag and that A tag will allow it
to be a link and I'll put the link the
label inside of it. This will make it
such that if I go here it renders the
label of each of the links. I know right
now it's just like not separated at all
but it's an actual link that I can click
to make it actually be clickable. I have
to put here the href which is going to
be the link.href. And you see that even
though there's no sections, if I click
on it, the URL changes because I'm
navigating between the different
sections. Perfect. Now, when you loop
through lists in React, it's always
important that you pass a key to the uh
highest level component or element that
you return. So, I'm just going to get
the index of each item and I'll just use
that as the key to help in to help React
process the list better. Now I feel like
it's time for us to add the styling for
the navbar. We created the elements but
I think the styling comes next. So to
start things off in the header tag over
here I want to add a class name and I
want to make it fixed at the top because
the network will scroll down with us so
that you always have access to it. So to
do that I'm going to pass the position
as fixed. Since I'm put passing a
position fixed I need to set it to the
top left. So put a top of zero and a
left of zero. Then I want to make the
background of the navbar be transparent.
You'll see why later, but basically the
navbar background will be transparent up
until when you scroll down and then it
becomes something else. It has like a
glassy look to it. Then the next thing
is I want to put a padding in the y
direction of five because that should
create a lot more space uh to actually
form the navbar. Then on our nav over
here, I'm going to add a bunch of
classes that are going to help define
the actual navigation. So to start off,
I'll make this a container and set the
margin in the X direction to be auto.
Also, I'll put a padding ax to be six
and I'll set the display to be flex,
which will allow me to center the items.
As you can see, now I want to justify
them in between, which will basically
actually let me remove this hero section
that I I realize now that I that text is
ruining what we have for the uh for the
navbar. Yeah, now it looks like a
navbar. I want to put a justify between
because then it will make it such that
this is absolutely on the left and this
is absolutely on the right. To do that,
I'm going to come here to our navbar and
I'll set justify between. And you'll see
that now it should have a separation,
but it doesn't because it doesn't know
where this navbar should end. So to do
that, I'm going to add also a right zero
to say that it ends at the right, the
absolute right. And you see that now the
logo appears on the left and the links
appear on the right. Perfect. Now on our
a tag over here which is the logo. We're
just going to set an href to be this
which basically will just just take you
to the top of the page. And then I want
to add a class name here. That will make
the logo have a size of XL. The font to
be bold. The tracking to be light. Now
obviously text to be Excel and the font
to be bold. You understand what it is.
It just makes the text a lot bigger and
the font will be bolder. But tracking
light is related to letter spacing. So
by setting it to light uh we're pretty
much so tracking light uh actually this
should be tracking tight. Sorry. Uh
tracking tight is related to the letter
spacing of the text. So by setting it to
tight is as if you were setting a letter
spacing to be something like0.5
or0.02
or something like that of em in letter
spacing. So, uh, it will make the text
be a little bit more put together. Then
I want to set the text to actually not
have then the text right now is white
because we set all of the text to be of
color foreground, right? However, I have
this primary color over here, right? And
this is the green color that we're using
throughout the website. So, what I want
to make it is that when you hover over
the logo is going to make the color of
the text be that primary color. To do
that, I just set it to text primary. And
now all of a sudden if I hover this it
will become uh the greenish color. Then
also the dot that we have here the
reason why we put a pen in between the
dot and the name the initials is just so
we can make that always be green. So
I'll do text primary and it will have
this green color already by default. Now
let's go to the desktop navigation in
here. I want to set the following. I
want to set the items to be center and
for them to have a gap of one. And then
I'll put here a display of flex. Now the
next thing I want to do is I want to
come to the div inside of this and I
want to set the class name to be glass.
Now what is glass? Glass is a class that
we haven't created yet. It's actually
going to be the background of this
navbar system and we're going to reuse
it multiple times in this project. To
create a tailwind class that we want to
reuse, but it's not just like something
small like a a collar. Uh it's something
a little bit more elaborate. We have to
utilize a another type of layer. This is
going to be the layer of components.
This are tailwind CSS CSS components
that we can reuse in our project which
are basically just normal CSS classes
but that we can call um in our class
name. So I'll create the glass class and
what I want to apply to it is I want to
apply the following. First we're setting
it background color to be a mix of the
color uh between the color surface which
is what we have over here for uh
surface. It's this black color over here
and transparent. Also, we're adding a
backdrop filter, which is going to add a
blur of 16 pixels. You can play around
with the blur if you think it doesn't
look like the glassy effect that I want
it to be. Then, we're going to add a
border here, which should use the color
border that we also defined at the top.
And just like that, this should have
this glassy look. Now, because we
haven't added more styles to this, it
doesn't really look like anything, but
you'll see in a second how good this
actually looks. So to get that to look
better, we're going to add here a
rounded full, which should add a border
radius to this uh navbar. Then I want to
add here a padding in the x direction of
two and a padding in the y direction of
one. Also a display flex. I'll center
the items and I'll put a gap of one in
between each of the items. Now you can
see it a lot better. Then what I want to
do is I want to come inside of this a
tag over here. And for each tag, let's
add a bunch of class names. I'll make
each individual link have a padding in
the x direction of four, so they have
more space and a padding in the y
direction of two. I'll make the text be
small. And the color of it is actually
going to be using this other color that
we defined called muted foreground. It's
basically the color of our foreground
color, but a bit muted. So the
foreground color is white. The muted
version is like grayish. So we'll do
this. We're going to say muted
forground. Then we're going to add it
such that when you hover it, it then
becomes the foreground color which is
white. I'm going to make it such that
each of the links will be rounded full.
And you'll see that now they look a lot
better, right? As you hover them, it it
is gray and then it becomes white. But I
also want to make a specific like uh
background to each of the links as well,
especially when you hover it. So when
you hover the section, each link, I want
to add a bg, which is going to have the
color equal to surface. It's this color
over here. So to do that I'm going to
set here BG surface. And as you can see
now when I hover this it creates this
really cool effect. Now we want to add
the call toaction button. That call to
action button is going to exist uh below
this desktop nav and I'm going to write
over here CTA button and it's going to
be a button that leads you to the
contact section. So I'm going to add a
div over here which is going to call
this component which we haven't created
yet called the button. Now, why are we
making a component for button? Well,
we're going to have multiple buttons in
this project and it's going to be super
useful for us to just have one component
that we can reuse and it specifies all
the classes and styles that we want for
what a button should look like. To do
that, I'm going to come here and I'm
going to create here a folder called
components. Now, in the components,
we're going to create any shared
components that we're going to have in
this project. For example, the
button.jsx.
Now, in this button component, we're
going to export a constant called
button. And this component is going to
have a lot of variety to it. So, it's
going to require us to pass in some
props. For example, if you want to
customize anything else on the button,
you can just pass in a string, which is
the class name. And all of the styles
that you pass as a as the class name
prop will be added to our style. Also,
there's going to be this size prop that
we can pass. There's going to be three
sizes we want to specify that you can
use for the different buttons and we can
reuse it throughout our project. Then
we're going to accept children and
that's just because when we uh call this
component we want to allow the caller
which is just ourselves in different
components to specify the label inside
of it. Now I'm going to return a UI that
is going to be a normal button but it's
going to have a lot of specifications to
it. For example, it's going to have a
span inside of it with the children. Now
if I come here to the navbar and I
import that button over here. So import
button from the at components/button
then I can just put here the contact me
label and we should see that button
appearing with the correct label. But
let's add the rest of the styles. First
things first this span over here it's
going to have a default class to all of
it which is going to say uh the position
is going to be relative. Then we're
going to set a display of flex. We're
going to center the label. So item
center. We're going to justify it as
well to the center. And we're going to
set a gap of two. Then what I want to do
is I want to define some base classes.
So I'm going to pass here a variable
called base classes. Set it equal to a
string that is going to represent the
base classes for what a button should
look like in our project without the
need of or caring about the different
sizes and so on. So to start things off,
we're going to set a position to be
relative for the button. We're going to
set overflow to be hidden. We're going
to set a rounded full as the uh border
radius. And I'll also just open this up
a bit so you guys can see slightly the
button as we write. Obviously throughout
the rest of the tutorial, uh when we
have the uh mobile part being done, I'm
going to show the UI as I write the
code. But just for now, since we're
making the desktop part, it doesn't make
sense to do that. So I'll hide the the
the browser with my code editor. Then I
want to actually let me just apply this
this classes. These are the base
classes, but we're going to make some
changes to the final classes based on
it. Right now, we're just going to apply
the base classes to that. And I'll just
pass the class name and then insert
those base those classes in here. Now,
what else I want to do? Well, I want to
set the font to be medium. So, it's a
little bit more bold. And then I want to
set the focus of this button, which
right now it's barely a button. You can
barely click on it and so on, but it'll
be fine. Then I want to add here the
focus. I want to change some stuff out
of when you focus on the button, like
removing the outline when you focus on
it. I also want to add a ring when it is
visible. So, when I focus on the button
and it's visible, I'm going to add a
ring, which is of size two. A ring is
just kind of like a a border that goes
around inputs. Then I'm going to set the
same kind of style, but I'm going to
change the color of that ring when it's
focused. The color is going to be
primary. It's the green color. Then I'm
going to set a background color is also
going to be the green color. And I'll
text I'll just put the text color to be
the primary foreground color. So it's
the color that we should use in front of
the primary color, which is green. Then
finally when we hover this I want to set
the background to be the same primary
color we have right now but I want it to
be 90% opacity by adding the division
symbol over here in Tailwind. It
basically it removes the opacity
slightly. I don't know if you can see as
I hover that. Then the last thing I want
to do is I want to set a shadow that is
large and also a color of that shadow to
be the primary color but that's too big.
So I'm going to make it 25% opacity.
Perfect. Now we're almost there. But you
might be wondering why is it all
cluttered up, right? Why is the button
so small? That's because here's what we
need to do with the size, right? So when
we define this variable here, base
classes, this applies to every button,
no matter which size we choose. But in
the classes over here, we're going to
actually use some string templating to
apply the base classes. But depending on
what size we define, we're going to
apply different class names. So we have
to define here the different size class
correlation. It's going to be an object
and depending on which size you define
that you want for the button, we're
going to apply different styles. For
example, if you want the button to be
small, you're going to pass SM as the
size on the uh prop over here. And if
that's the case, then I want to apply
the following sizes. I want to say the
petting x will be four, the petting y
will be two, but the text is going to be
small. Now in the medium uh it's going
to be or I'm going to say default
actually we're going to set it to be
petting x of six petting y of three and
the text will be base which is just the
base size. Finally if I want the button
to be large then I'm going to set the
petting x to be eight the petting y to
be four and the text to be large. Now I
can just grab though the corresponding
class by getting this size classes
applying it over here just like this
getting the individual class or the
individual class names based on the size
prop and applying it. Now if I do this
nothing happens because we are we never
passed anything for this. Now size can
be null if we don't pass it right I'm
calling here and I'm not passing
anything for that prop. So I actually
want to default it to the default uh
size in case you don't pass anything.
And you'll see that it becomes a lot
bigger by default. Now we actually do
want to pass something and I actually
want to make it small, not default. So
I'm going to pass here the size prop and
I'm going to pass it to be small. So
it's a lot smaller. Then I'll come here
to the button and there's just one more
thing I want to do. If I ever want to
specify any extra class names, I'll just
insert them directly over here. Other
than that, we are good to go. I'll also
put here as an empty string just so that
it defaults to an empty string. Now,
let's close this up and go back to our
navbar. Now, we're pretty much done with
how the navbar should look like in dash
desktop. However, it doesn't look good
if we go into mobile. Let me scroll this
like this. You see everything gets
cluttered up and it looks horrible. So,
I think it's time for us to work on
that. So, to do that, I actually want to
hide all of this, right? The desktop
navigation and even this button. if I am
in a small screen. To do that, it's
actually pretty simple. What I have to
do is when I go here to the desktop
navigation, you see how we set the
display to flex to hide this section. I
can just set the display to hidden. But
then it would hide it as well if I make
this a lot bigger and we don't want
that. So actually I can specify that I
only want it to be hidden in small
screens. But when the screen is a
mediumsiz screen and above, then I want
to set it to be display flex. Again,
you'll see that in a small screen or
anything below medium, it's it doesn't
show, but as I scroll up, it appears
again. That's how you do some responsive
design using Tailwind CSS. We'll do the
same thing with other parts of this. For
example, with this uh contact button
over here, we actually don't want it to
appear uh if it is a small screen. So,
I'm going to set it to be display
hidden. And if it a medium screen and
above, I'm not going to use display
flags. I'm going to use display block
just cuz it makes more sense in this
case. Then we want to create the mobile
menu button. But in this case, we want
to do it a bit different because we want
to make it only appear if the user is in
a small screen, not if it's in the big
screen like we were doing before. So to
do that, I'm going to create a button.
And this one, we're not going to be
reusing the same class name just because
this button is very specific. It's a
mobile navigation button. And in here in
the class name, I want to make it such
that it is hidden in a medium screen and
above, but it's a normal display flex or
display block if it's not a medium
screen and above. Also, we're going to
add a padding overall, not just in an X
or Y direction of two. And I'll set the
text to be the foreground color. Then I
want to make the label of this to be an
icon. Which icon? Well, it's a hamburger
menu icon. But to use icons, I need to
install another package. We're going to
be using an icon library which you might
already know because it's one of the
most famous one out there. It's Lucid
React. I'm going to install Lucid React.
And I'm going to come back over here and
I'm just going to call the menu
component. The menu component is a
component from Lucid that just renders
the icon for the menu, which is the one
that we want for the mobile menu. We can
also specify a size over here. And I'll
set the size to be 24, which is pretty
much the same as it is already. Now,
it's time for us to build the actual
mobile menu. So, to do that, I'm going
to create another section over here.
Call it mobile menu. And in here, we're
going to add a div. And remember, since
this is only in mobile, we need to do
the same logic we did over there, where
in a medium screen and above, I want to
hide it. But other than that, I want to
actually have it be a real section. Now
I want to use the glass class for this.
However, uh I want to make it a bit
different. We have here the glass class.
I want to have a version of this that is
slightly stronger. That means 80% for
the color mix, 80% for the border, and
also the the blur. I don't want it to be
16. I want it to be 24. It's just a
slightly stronger version of this. So
I'll just copy and paste here this other
class. It's the same thing, but you saw
that we changed a bit of the items. and
I'm going to use it as the type over
here, glass strong. Then inside of this
div, I want to add another div. This one
is just going to contain the same stuff
that we pretty much had over here. So,
I'm going to copy this and I'll just
paste it inside of here. It's just going
to render the individual links, but it's
definitely going to be different. Why?
Because in that case, in the normal
desktop menu, everything was appearing
one right next to the other. But in
mobile, they should appear vertically.
So to start things off, I want to come
over here, set this to be a container, a
margin X to be auto, a padding X to be
six, and then a petting Y to be six as
well. Finally, I want to display to be
flex, but then the direction is going to
be column, so they stack on top of each
other. Then I also want to put a gap of
four, which is space them out just
slightly. And then inside of here, I
want to make some changes to the actual
links. Now, what do I want to do? Well,
they're completely different in mobile.
So, I will remove most of that. And I
want to make it such that the text is
actually larger in mobile, so it's
easier to see. The color is still going
to be muted foreground, which is what we
had before. And we're going to have that
thing where when you hover it, it
becomes foreground. Hovering in mobile
is kind of useless in my opinion, even
though you still have to do it because
who hovers over things in mobile, but
we'll do that. And then I'll put a
padding Y of two. Perfect. Then we also
want to have the contact me button like
we had before. I'll just copy this and
I'll put it directly below this. We
don't have to do that check. And it
pretty much is exactly how I want it to
look. Now, you can make it bigger if you
want to since it is in mobile. I'll even
make it bigger. Actually, I think I like
it this way. Uh, no. Let's make it the
medium one. That's fine. And now, here
is where you might be wondering. Okay,
that's fine. But when like how do I make
it only appear when I click on this
button? Because right now, it's
appearing no matter what. And that's a
good question. Now to do that we need to
keep track of whether or not the user
has clicked on this button and that
requires us to have a state and I'll do
that by creating one over here. We're
going to create a state called is mobile
menu open and set is mobile menu open is
going to be a use state which is a
boolean that starts off as false. Now we
only want to show this mobile menu if
the is mobile menu open is true. So I'll
wrap this entire thing around with this
conditional and I'll put a double emper
to represent that I'm only showing this
if this condition is true. Now how do we
make this condition become true? Well on
the mobile menu button we're going to
add an on click to it and we're going to
basically call the set is mobile menu
open and we're going to set that value
to be the opposite of what it is right
now. So that it's kind of like a toggle.
I click on it, it becomes false or it
becomes true because initially it's
false. And then if I click on it again,
it becomes false again. So it just
switches its values. So to do that, I
need to get what the current value is. I
can access it in this callback function
and set it to be the opposite of that.
Now when I click on this, it opens. When
I click on it again, it closes. I can
keep clicking it if I want to. But the
icon here should actually change also if
I click on it because if not, then it
looks a bit weird, right? because it
shows it as in menu. Actually, what I
want to do is if the is mobile menu is
already open, then I want to show a
different icon, the X icon. If it's
false, then I want to show the menu
icon. I'll also set the size to be 24 to
maintain consistency. Now, you see that
when I hover this and I click on it, it
should work. But it actually breaks the
website. Let's check to see why. Oh, it
seems like we didn't import X from Lucid
React. I apologize for that. Let me do
that again. And yeah, you see that now
it switches. It's basically just an X.
If you want to just use X, you can do
that, too. But I prefer using the icon.
I also want to make it such that when I
hover it, it um it actually changes the
cursor to be pointer. So I'll do that.
And you see that it does do that.
Perfect. Now you see that when I show
this, it doesn't have a smooth animation
like you might have seen in my demo.
Actually, we wanted to animate like a
fade in animation as you press on this.
And there's different ways to do
animations in Tailwind or in CSS in
general. However, we're going to be
using normal CSS animations for this
project. So, for all the animations
we're going to have in this project, I'm
going to come here to our index.tss. And
in here, I want to create a layer, which
is going to be the utilities layer. This
layer is going to be used for all of the
utility classes, like for example,
animations. Then, I'll define an
animation. The first one we're going to
have is a fade in animation, which it
just fades some element into the page.
Now, to do that, we need to set an
animation. Now, an animation requires us
to put a couple things. The first thing
is what is the actual animation name or
the animation that you want to create.
So, we're going to create a fadein
animation. I'm going to call it fade in
and we'll create it up here. To create
an animation, we'll set key frames, give
it a name, fade in, and we have to
basically um specify the initial
condition of this animation and the end
condition. The initial condition will be
defined by a from and the end condition
will be defined by a two. So, it goes
from this state to this state. Now,
initially to fade in, you want to have
the item have an opacity of zero and
then when it's over, that opacity will
be one so it becomes fully visible.
Also, you kind of want to it's fading
in, so it kind of moves slightly, right?
It starts at a position slightly above
what it should be at the end. So, I'll
set a transform over here and use the
translate Y function and basically
translate Y that item 20 pixels above.
Then I'll set it back to zero when it's
done. And finally, I want to add a
slight blur when it is when it starts.
And I'll set that to 10 pixels. And then
I'll remove that blur when it's over. So
I'll set it to zero. Now just like this,
we can come here and add this animate
fade in class. Now absolutely nothing
happens as you can see. Why? Because we
basically didn't define how long and how
this animation should play out. So to do
that, we're going to set the duration to
be 0.8 seconds. So it takes just a
slight amount of time to animate in as
you can see. And also I want to set in
the ease out and both. What you'll see
is that now when I refresh this, it has
a way smoother animation in into the
page. Perfect. That's the first
animation we're going to create. And
we're going to create a lot of other
animations. Now, from now on, since I
already went into detail about how to
create this animation, whenever we have
an animation that we want to create,
I'll copy and paste them into the
utilities layer, and I'll just talk
about them. I won't show myself writing
so that I don't waste ourselves our
times. Now, we're pretty much done with
our navbar and we can get started on our
first section. Okay, everyone. To start
things off on the hero section, we're
going to start by defining some of the
most basic classes that we're going to
apply to every single section. So, for
the hero section is actually a bit
different because the hero section
should be the first thing you see and
it's going to fill up the entire screen
and then you're going to be able to
scroll down. So, I'm going to set a
position to be relative, a minimum
height to be of this screen size, then a
display flex, an items center, and an
overflow hidden. Then, inside of this
section, we're going to first set the
background. The background is going to
be the background image to this section.
So, I'm going to set a div and I'm going
to put an image inside of it. Now, you
can use the same image I use on my
project by downloading all of the assets
in the description. In fact, uh, if I
already added all of those assets into
this project, it's going to be on the
public folder. So, if you go to your
public folder, as you can see over here,
I added a bunch of stuff over here. The
first thing is I added this image called
the herobg, which is just the background
image we're going to put in the hero
section. I also added a profile photo.
This is clearly AI generated. I
literally uh I got it from like either
the internet or I generated with PT, but
you can put your own picture, of course.
Um, it's the photo that's going to show
up over here. Then for projects, these
are photos of actual projects that I've
made videos on. So, uh here is where
you're going to add the photos for the
projects that you have built and you
want to showcase. So, you can add as
many as you want. I'll show you guys how
to um add more projects later, but I'm
just adding the photos initially just so
we have that ready. But most
importantly, we want to use this herobg
image that I have over here. So to use
that what I want to do is on this image
I want to set the source to be equal to
/herobg.jpg
because if I access if I put images and
assets on the public folder you can
access it directly without having to um
put the specific pathway. Now you see it
shows up over there but obviously
there's so much more we want to change.
I'm going to add an alt over here which
just says hero image but you can add
something more specific for
accessibility. Then I'll add a class
name. The class name is I want to make
the width be the full width of the
screen, the height to be the full width.
Um, and then I want to set the object to
be covered and the opacity to be 40.
Now, the object cover doesn't really do
anything yet, but the opacity, you see,
it blends in a little bit better. Now,
what I want to do is I want to set this
div to have a class name of position
absolute. So, it should be position
absolute and then have an inset to be
zero. So it actually blends in really
nice. Then below this, I'm going to add
a div that is actually going to be a
self-closing div. This div will have a
position of absolute, another inset of
zero, and I'm going to set a gradient to
be accompanying this image. It's going
to be a gradient. And to build a
gradient to the background, you set the
bg to have a gradient. And you say 2B.
When when you say 2B, it basically
starts at the top and then goes to the
bottom. So that's what it does. If you
wanted to do it to the right, you could
do to right. Now, I want to make it 2B,
so to the bottom. And I want to take it
from the color background, but
background with only 20% opacity cuz I
thought that was a bit too strong to
eventually get to the background at the
bottom. You see it now has this
gradient. However, I also want to add a
color in between. So, to add a color in
between the two, so it's a gradient with
three colors, you add a via in the
middle, and you add whatever color you
want to do. I'm going to make it such
that it goes from 20 to 80% opacity to
full opacity. So I'll make it here in
the middle. It will be 80% opacity. So
this is the background image with the
gradient around it. Then here's where it
becomes a bit cool. I want to make some
really interesting green dots that just
like float around the screen. You've
probably seen this so many times on
websites. I think it's really cool. I've
added multiple times in my projects. And
even if you don't want to add it, I
think it's a good work experience. like
you you'll understand how to do this and
maybe use that for other projects. What
we want to do is we want to create a div
and in this div we want to actually loop
through an array of 30 items. 30 items
because we want to have 30 dots but you
can choose the different value for it.
To do that it's a nifty hack here. You
create an array by using the array
function and you define the length. I'm
defining to be 30. It'll create an array
of 30 items that are pretty much empty.
It's nothing. You don't need to care
about what goes inside of it. What you
need to care is that it's going to loop
through them 30 times. Now, for each
item that it loops, we want to get the
index of that item. And then we want to
render a div. And on this div, we're
going to render a green dot that
represents it. So, I'll start with a
class name. I'm going to set it to be
absolute. The width of the dot is going
to be 1.5. And the height is going to be
1.5. Then, because it's a dot, it should
be fully rounded to make it into a
circle. And then the opacity I'm going
to set it to be 60. Now you're not
seeing anything on the screen, right?
But that's because to make this work, we
it would be better if we didn't actually
use Tailwind. We applied most of the
styles directly through CSS using the
style object over here. For example, I
want to apply the background color and I
want to make it be uh this green color
over here. It's pretty much the you see
all of them now are appearing, but
they're all appearing one on top of each
other. So it's 30 dots appearing over
here. Then I want to actually define
where they appear in the screen. So
because the position is absolute, I'm
going to have to define a left and a
top. But I want them to be random. So I
want to make it such that the left
positioning, it's going to be a random
position. And I'll do this by adding a
variable over here. math.random using
the random function. And I want it to be
one value between zero and 100. To do
that, I just multiply this times 100.
Now why 100? because 100% of the screen
or 100% of the horizontal width. So this
is a percentage. So that's why I made it
into a template string so I can put the
percentage sign in the end. Now I'll
copy this and do the exact same thing at
the top. And you see that they randomly
appear as I refresh this. They'll always
appear at the random places. Now we do
want to make them animate where they
move because this looks really ugly if
you want to do it this way. And also I
want to add some class names here to
make just the overall thing look better.
I want to make this be absolute. set the
inset to be zero and the overflow to be
hidden. And I want to remove any pointer
events. That's just to make sure nothing
funky happens. Then I also want to make
sure if you notice when we added this uh
thing that covers everything, right? It
kind of appears above the the navbar. So
I need to change some things on the nav
bar to make that work. For example, I
want to make the nav bar appear on top
of that gradient. So I'll set the zindex
to be 50. So now it actually appears
just that. Now we'll come back here and
we'll apply the animation. Now how do we
apply that animation? Well, we need to
create that animation. So I'm going to
come here into our index.css and I'll
create it. Now remember I already told
you I'm not going to show myself
creating every animation. So I'm just
going to paste this animation first.
I'll start with the key frame. The
animation is going to be called slow
drip. It's going to have actually a good
amount of stages. On this one we just
had two stages. It starts at a point and
then it ends at another. So that's why
we use the from and to. But when you
want to actually have very specific
structures, right, it goes from 0% to
25. So there's four steps in the way,
you can add percentages instead. So it
starts and ends at zero, meaning all the
dots will always start and end at the
position they were assigned when we used
the math.random over here. But then at
25, it will translate to the to the left
20 and also -30. And then it will move
another uh set of positioning on the 50%
and then again on the 75%. Now because
we're using this animation on our uh
style class over here, we don't have to
create any tailwind um classes in here.
We can just do it directly here. So I'll
just do that. I'll set the animation to
be equal to slow drift. Now you see
nothing happens until we add a certain
length to that animation. We could for
example add here 1 second. And you'll
see that we could for example add here I
don't know 50 seconds and you'll see
that they will start moving. However,
they're all moving in the same direction
and they're all moving at the same time.
That's why because we also want to
randomize how long it takes for the anim
animation to happen. So what I do is I'm
going to add 15 plus math.random and
make it be a random value between 0 and
20 and then apply that to seconds. So
they're all moving at actual different
rates. Then I want to add the is in out
property and make it infinite so that
when it ends it actually restarts the
animation. Now it actually looks like
they're moving on their own. Now I also
want to put an animation delay just so
that they they don't all start at the
same time because if we do that then
there is a chance that they actually all
start moving in the same direction just
by chance right but with an animation
delay we can actually make it such that
some of them are going to start at a
different start time than others. So I'm
going to set math.random and I want to
make them start at an interval of 0 to 5
seconds. So you see some of them takes 5
seconds to start, some don't take any
time. Perfect. Now we have our dots
created. Now it's time for us to create
the content of the hero section. So I'll
create here content and then I'll define
here the div for this section. We'll
start by adding another div inside of
it. And we'll separate our hero section
between a column, a left column, which
is basically going to be the text
content of this hero section, and we're
going to have the right column, which is
going to be the uh profile image. Now,
for the left section, we're going to add
a div, and we're going to add a little
badge. Now, this badge is going to be
for the name of the section. So, I'll
show you how it will turn out at the
end. So, this is the final result,
right? This is how it's going to look in
the end. You see that uh this is the
badge I'm talking about. Now, in mobile
mode, it doesn't matter. They don't have
this uh this left and right column, but
we're going to start building uh for
desktop at the same time. So, we'll
structure it this way. And we want to
start by building that batch. To do
that, I'm going to add a span over here
that is going to show what your position
is or what you work as. So, I'm going to
put software engineer, but you can put
whatever you want. and I'll put that I
am a React specialist, but you can put
whatever specialization you want to
choose. Now, what I want to do is I want
to just apply the styles. So, I'll start
off by adding a style here to this span.
I'm going to make it such that it has a
width of two, a height of two, a BG that
is going to be primary, and it's going
to be rounded full. So, it's that green
uh rounded pill, right? But it's behind
our gradient. So, we'll have to address
that. Then I want to make it such that
this div is going to have the animate
fade in. Most of our elements from now
on are going to have an animate fade in
which is that animation we created for
the navbar just because we want them to
appear immediately when the user appears
in the section. We also want to wrap
this span with another span just so we
can apply some some uh styles. Now, if
you're confused why sometimes I add div,
sometimes I add spans, it's just because
spans literally has no inherent uh
styles to it. So, it's good for us to if
we want to apply styles without having
any other um side effects to it. Now, in
this span, I'm going to add a class name
where the display is going to be inline
flex. The items are going to be
centered. And then I'm going to set the
gap between the two items. A gap of two.
And then a padding X of four and a
padding Y of two. Then I want to set the
rounded to be full. I want the
background to be glass. And then I want
to set the text to be small and the text
to be primary. Now, you might be
wondering why we screwed it up, right?
Because it looked already good before.
But here's what we have to do. we have
to remove this and then make it such
that this is self-closing and now this
will be part of this. Then on this div I
want to set the um class to have a space
in the y direction of eight. That's
because this is the left column and in
between the text and all the sections
here there's going to be a gap of eight
in between each item on the y direction.
Then just to set this up finally I'm
going to set this the class names for
this outer uh div here. I'm going to set
it to be a container, margin X to be
auto, padding X to be six, padding top
to be 32, padding bottom to be 20,
position to be relative, and the Z index
to be 10. Then on this div, I'm going to
set this to be a grid. However, only if
you are not in a very large screen. If
you are in a very large screen, then I
want to set the specific amount of
columns to be two because when you
expand this and you get to a large
screen, it becomes two columns in this
section. But in normal ones, it becomes
one column, right? So that it actually
stacks one on top of the other. I'm also
going to put a gap of 12 in between each
item. Now, we won't see any change in
that just because we we only have one
items right now. But I'll also center
everything. Now, we're almost done. The
only thing I want to do is if you notice
this has a little pulsing animation as
you can see and I want to add that as
well. To do that I'm going to add an
animate pulse over here to this spin.
Now do we have to make that animation?
No. That's actually an animation that
comes already with Tailwind CSS. So we
don't have to worry about making it
ourselves. Now we'll come down below
this div and we're going to add the
headline for the hero section. So we'll
create a div and we'll add an H1 text
that will say something in the lines of
this. So I added here I just copied and
paste it just because whatever you write
is going to be very different from what
I write. But uh it came with already
some styles that I'll just explain what
it is. So right off the bat just put
something like for example that is catch
you right it's what's going to appear at
the top of your page. In our case we
want to put this crafting digital
experiences with precision. But here's
the kicker. We want to make it such that
it is very interactive, very, you know,
you can look at it and be like, okay,
they put some time into it. So, we made
it such that there's a clear change in
the pattern of the text. The big part of
the text is just a normal white um text,
but then the digital part over here is
going to be green, which is the primary
color. And then this last part,
precision, is going to be a different
font. That's why we created the font
serif class in the beginning. It applies
a different font. And also we made it
itallic by setting the italic class. Now
we also want to make it font normal and
text white. And I wanted to do this as
well. Set the color of the digital to be
text primary. And then there's this
class that we don't have right now. It's
going to be called glow text. And it's
going to make a text have a little glow.
So how do we make that class? Well,
we'll come here to our index.css. And
similar to how we did with the glass and
the glass strong, this is going to be a
class that is a component. We're going
to create a class called glow text. And
all it does is it sets a text shadow and
it uses our color primary together with
the transparent color to make a subtle
shadow around the text. Now we can
continue moving forward. The next thing
we want to do is add a paragraph tag
that should appear right below it. It's
a little bit description of what you are
like who you are. Right? So I added this
paragraph tag as well cuz it's going to
be different for you guys. Um, and it
came with a little bit of uh some class
names like a text large to make it
bigger, a text muted foreground to
change the color to gray, and I made the
whole section be a little bit bigger.
Now, I put this, it's clearly AI
generated. I obviously I'm not going to
write a copy for this. I just asked Chap
to generate a description of myself, but
uh you can put whatever you want and
make sure that it doesn't sound like
corny, you know? I mean, I think mine
already sounds a bit corny, but make it
personal, but also make it make sense to
who you are as a developer. Now, here's
the kicker. Because we applied the
animate fade in, you see that this top
over here fades in, right? But the way
we want it to happen is actually like
this. There's a delay between the
different sections of the hero section
and how they fade in. This fades in
first, this fades in second, and then
this fades in after. You'll see that
when I refresh the final product, this
is exactly what happens. So, here's what
we have to do. We have to set a animate
fade in to uh one of the sections over
here. Uh we're going to add more stuff
to this. But uh for now, let's just
focus on this. I'm going to add an
animate fade in here. Now, we don't want
it to happen at the same time, right?
Then I'll come here to this div. I'm
just going to put a space of y of four
so that there is a gap between this text
and this one. And then let me come to
this H1 tag and let me just set a class
name here. I'm going to make it 5 XL so
it's a way bigger. Then I want to make
it be on a medium screen and above I'm
going to make it even bigger. 6 XL. In a
large screen I'm going to make it be 7
XL. Then I'll make the font be bold.
I'll change the leading. Remember we
made it tight. And then I'm going to add
the animate fade in. But here's the
kicker. We want to make it such that
they don't appear at the same time. This
appears first, this second, and then
this third. To do that, we're going to
create a bunch of animation delay
classes. So down here in our utility
layer, we're going to create a animation
delay for each amount of delay we want
to set. So I already created here. It's
very repetitive. And what this looks
like is like this. If I want to apply a
delay of 100 milliseconds to an
animation. Now there's an animation
delay class- 100. Same thing with 200,
300, 400, 500. And what does this mean?
It means that if I want to make it such
that for example this appears first then
this then this then I go to the I don't
put a delay on the first part but then
on the second one which is this one over
here I set the animation delay to be 100
right because then now uh this appears
first and this now it's not that clear
because 100 milliseconds is not that
much but let's make this one have I
don't know 800 just for now just for to
see how how obnoxious that is. So, so
let me refresh this. And oh, that didn't
even do anything. There's definitely
something wrong. Oh yeah, I wrote this
wrong. Should be animation delay. Let's
refresh this. And yeah, it takes 800
milliseconds for this animation to be
done. Now, to be subtle, we're going to
make this be 200. Now, this comes first.
100 millconds later, this comes. And
then 200 millconds later, this comes.
And now it looks a lot better. Perfect.
Now, we can come back here and we can
continue building. Now, the first thing
is I want to add a call to action
section right below the text. So I'm
going to put here CTAs. Now there's
going to be two call to actions. So
they're both going to be buttons. One of
them is going to be a button that has a
size over here of large. So we're
reusing that button class we have. And
then uh did it did that not import that
class? Yeah, it didn't. So it broke our
website. So let me import button from at
slash and then we do components
slashutton. Now that appears. We need to
put a label inside of it. I'm going to
say contact me. Then I want to make it
such that it also has a little arrow
next to it. So I'm going to use the
arrow right class from Lucid. It will be
an icon. And I want to make it such that
the class has a size of five. So I'll
put here size of five. Actually that's
way too small. Uh I didn't want to put a
size. I'll use a class name where the
width is five and the height is five.
That looks a lot better. Then I want to
add another button. However, this button
will have a little bit of a different
aspect to it. This button should look
like this. Just a normal button. But
this one has this really cool border
animation. So, I want to create a button
which is going to do that. Now, to do
that, we're going to actually render a
normal button because we don't want to
apply that other styles that that we
have. And we want to add an SVG inside
of it. Now, I'm not going to show myself
writing the SVG just because this is not
an SVG tutorial. But this SVG is going
to be the animated SVG that we have
around this button. Now, to actually get
it to work, we're also going to put a uh
a text in here. So, I'm going to add a
span. And this span is going to put
whatever you want to add as the
secondary button on this call to action.
On for my website, I'm going to make it
be a download CV cuz you want to make it
very like apparent that you where you
need to download the the the resume,
right? uh you don't want to make it such
that they take forever to find that. Now
I also want to import the download icon
from Lucid. I can just import up here uh
from Lucid download. And then what I
want to do is apply some styles. I'll
start with the button over here. I want
to make it such that the class name and
I actually want to put a good amount of
uh classes here. So to not clutter this
entire page, I'm going to create a
different component over here. I'm going
to call it animated border button.jsx.
And in here, we're going to export con
animated border button. And we're going
to just paste whatever we have from
here. Copy this and then paste it here.
Then we're just going to call that
animated border button. And in here, we
now have to reimpport this download icon
from Lucid. Perfect. And I'm just going
to copy and paste the direct class names
for this button because it's a lot of it
and it's a lot related to how we want
this button to look based on the SVG.
But pretty much this is what we want.
Now there's a bit more that we need to
do. For example, this last class over
here, all of this is just pretty much
what we talked about on the first button
when we were creating. So I don't want
to just talk about it again. But this
animated border here, this is not a
tailwind class. We have to make this.
Now where do we make this? Well, when I
hover this, I want to add the animation.
So, I need to go to the layers of
utility um exactly where we are around
here. And I'm going to create this
class. Now, the class should be animated
border and it should have the following
uh properties, but more specifically
only if it's a hover. As you can see, it
should make the whole thing be kind of
fading in as a glass and green uh by
mixing up the background color and the
backdrop filter. But still, it's not
animating the whole thing. And that's
because we created this class over here
inside of the SVG, the path that goes
around the border. We created this
download CV path. Now, I'm actually
going to call it something else. I'm
going to call it animated border path.
Why? Just because we're going to reuse
this button in another case that isn't
the download CV button. So, I don't want
to call it the same thing. Now what I
want to do is above this I want to set a
group hover and then set the animated
border path and I'll set an animation in
here. Now what animation do we want to
make? Well, it's going to be an
animation that is related to the um that
makes the uh actual SVG move around the
border. We're going to call it animated
border and it uses the stroke dash
offset as a property to make that
happen. Now we have to apply that
animation. So, I'm just going to copy
this, apply it over here, and you see
absolutely nothing happens as of right
now. However, I'm going to put here a
duration of 1.5 seconds. I'm going to
make it linear and infinite so that it
keeps rolling around. And you see that
now it does work, but hear me out. I
know it looks very ugly. So, we're going
to fix that. To fix that, there's a
couple more things that we need to do.
To start things off, I'm going to come
here to this pen, and I'm going to add a
class name of relative, then a Z of 10.
And I want to make the display be flex.
Then items center justify center and a
gap of two. Then on this download, I
just want to make it a little bit
smaller. Make it exactly the same size
as the other icon with a width of five
and a height of five. Now it looks a lot
better. Now I want to put a space in
between them. And to do that I'm going
to come here to our hero section and on
this div I'm going to put a display
flex, a flex wrap, and a gap of four.
The gap is what sets the width in
between them. I also want to animate
this fade in and set a delay of 300. So
I'll say animation delay 300. And now
this should appear after the top as
well. Now we want to add another section
over here which is going to be for the
social links. So I'm going to say social
links. It's going to be any links to
your social medias. Now sometimes you
don't want to do this, sometimes you
want. Feel free to put your social media
if you want to. Now I'll say span over
here and I'll put follow as in like
follow me at and then after the span I'm
going to actually create an object uh
not an object an array of objects with
each of the social links. Now the first
one is going to have an icon and it's
going to be my GitHub account. I'll use
the GitHub icon from Lucid and I'll use
the href over here which is just going
to take you to I'll just put this cuz
I'm not going to link my actual GitHub
but put your actual GitHub account over
here. Don't put a hashtag. Put the link
to where you chose your GitHub account.
Then add two more sections over here.
And we're going to add a link to your
LinkedIn and a link to your Twitter. Out
of those, maybe you don't want to show
your Twitter, but I don't know. And then
put the actual links over here. Now, why
do we make this array? Because we want
to map through it. Now, I need to put it
inside of here. I'm going to map through
each item. And for each item, I'll get
the social. I'll also get the index. And
I'm going to render an a tag that is
going to be the link to the item. Now I
can access this. I like I can't just do
this to render the actual icons. This
are components. That's how Lucid React
works. So to get this as a component and
render, I have to do the following. I
have to say open and close this. And
it's going to be self-closing. And then
I get the social item.
And now it should render each icon as
you can see. Then I also want to make it
so that when you click on this link, it
takes you to that link. Uh I also pass a
key here just so that because it's a
list, you don't have to do that. And
then in href, I'm going to pass here the
the social.href. Now again, mine won't
take you anywhere, but yours should
definitely be taking you to your
individual pages. Then on this div,
let's start styling this by setting a
flex items center, a gap of four, and
I'm going to use the animate fade in and
apply a delay of 400. Now, because you
you add 100 to every single new item you
add. Then on this span, I'm going to add
here a text size to be small and the
color to be muted foreground. Then on
the individual icons, here's what we're
going to do. We're gonna say padding of
two rounded full. Then we're going to
apply the glass effect on each of them.
And when you hover it, we're going to
make it the background be green. So
primary, but only uh 10% of it. So we'll
divide it by 10. So it looks a bit like
this. Then we also want to set the hover
to set the color to be primary so that
the icon colors changes to green when
you hover it as well. And then I want to
make it such that it transitions all and
has a duration of 300. Whenever you have
a transition uh with your colors and
all, you can actually make it a lot
smoother by adding a transition. And you
can specify what kind of transition you
want to add and the duration of it. So
you can see as I hover it, it does
become a lot more smooth. Now we're
pretty much done. Let me just add a
specific size to each icon. We're going
to make it be five and five on both of
them. So they are a little bit smaller.
And now, as you can see, uh oh, this
text says follow me. So probably we'll
do the same thing here. Follow me. As
you can see, we're almost done. The only
time the only uh thing we need to do now
is add the image. Now for the image,
it's going to be the right column. So
right below this right column over here,
we're going to add a div for this
section. Now how's this going to work?
Well, we're going to have first the
profile image, which is going to be
rendered by showing a div over here. And
we're going to put a another div for the
actual image. And then on this image,
I'm going to put the source to be that
of my profile photo, which you should
name the same thing. Now it appears over
here. I also want to put an alt and the
alt here put your name because uh if
whoever is reading your thing has a
disability, they can know who you are.
Then I'm going to put a class name of
this where I set the width to be full,
the aspect to be four out of five.
That's really important. And then the
object of course to be cover. And I'm
going to set a border radius of 2 XL. So
it slightly moves. Now what do we want
to do? Well, I want to make it such that
when we come here to this uh div, it
actually even if it expands, it appears
as a card, right? Not just a random
image in the middle of the website. So
to do that, I'm going to apply here a
class name of position relative. And I'm
going to also animate fade in, but put
an animation delay of 300. Then on this
one, we're going to set position
relative and a max width of medium, so
it's a bit smaller. And then a margin X
of auto, so it's centered. Then on this
div over here, we're going to set the
position to be relative. And also to
have the glass background and for it to
be rounded 3 XL, which is not exactly
the same, uh, but it will look perfectly
fine. A padding of two, so it has that
little border. And I'm going to add a
globe border. What is globe border?
Well, it's going to be a class that we
need to create over here, and it's going
to be the last class that we create on
our components layer. It's basically the
same thing as a glow text, but for
borders. It creates this little glow
around a border. Now, we go back here to
the hero, and there's one more thing I
want to do. I want to add a glowing ring
around the image. So, above this div, I
want to add the following div. Now, this
div will add even more of a glow around
it. However, we need to create a little
animation where it actually pulsates.
There's this animate pulsate glow, which
uh is wrong. It should actually just be
animate pulse, and then it makes this
little pulsing animation around the
image. Now, we want to create the stats
cards that goes around the image. So,
we're going to start by setting uh right
below this div over here, but still
inside of the like the div of the image,
but after the image, we're going to set
two things. the floating badge and also
the stats badge. Now, for the floating
badge, I want to add a div which will
contain another div and then a
self-closing div. You'll see why. And
then a span that just says that you're
available for work. Then I want to set
the class name of this to be position
absolute because it's absolute inside of
this card. I'm going to set it to be
negative to the bottom four. So, it's
basically a little bit below the bottom.
and negative to the right. So you'll see
negative right four. So it's also a
little bit to the right. And then we're
going to make the background be glass.
We're gonna make it be rounded. So I
need to change this to say D. And then
I'll make the padding X to be four. And
then a padding Y of three. And then I'm
going to add another type of animation.
This is going to be an animate float.
Now animate float is going to make it
such that this little card or badge over
here will actually look like it's
floating. To create this animation,
we'll create the the key frames for it
by setting the start positioning to be
at zero and then it will at 50% move a
little bit up. And then we'll create the
actual animate class called animate
float. Set it to be 4 seconds long and
it's infinite. So it will always look
like it's going up and then going down
and then going up and then going down.
Now we'll do this for the other one as
well. But before we get that, we need to
actually set a display flex here. items
to be centered and then a gap of three.
Then in this div, we want to set the
width to be three, the height to be
three, and I and I want it to be like a
a green indicator. So it will be a green
color. So 500 to indicate that you're
like available for work, right? It's a
square because obviously it's a square
by default, but we need to make it into
a circle by setting the rounded to full.
And then I'm going to use the animate
pulse default animation from Tailwind to
make it like it's pulsing. Now, on this
pen, all we want to do is just set the
text to be small and then set the font
to be medium. Now, we build the stats
badge. This one will be very similar,
but just a bit different because it's
going to be at the top. Now, to start
things off, I'm going to just add here
the actual stats that you have. Now,
what stats do you want to put? I don't
know. Put something that makes sense for
you. I'm just going to put that I have 5
years of experience by adding here a div
and then another div that says years
experience. And then on this div, we're
going to set the position to be absolute
and we'll make it be at the top again.
And then we'll make it leg negative left
four. Then we're going to make it glass
rounded XL. Pretty much the same thing
we did for the other one. Petting X of
four, petting Y of three, animate
floats. But this one will have an
animation delay of 500. Then on this
one, we're going to set the text to be 2
XL, the font to be bold, and the text
color to be primary. On this one, we're
going to actually make it a lot smaller.
Text extra small, and it's actually
going to be grayish color. So, muted
foreground. Perfect. Now, we're pretty
much done. And it's and it's time for us
to add the list of skills that you have
on your on your resume. Well, to do
this, we need to first create a list of
all the skills that we want to list out.
So, I'll create here a an array called
skills. And you'll fill in with strings
of technologies and frameworks and
whatever soft skills you want to put as
your skills. Now, I literally just
generated this. This is just what like
uh it's the default what you need to
know if you're going to be uh working as
a full stack webdev nowadays. I would
say it's around this. and I just added
as a template here, but you should put
whatever you feel comfortable with. Then
you come down here and right below here,
we're going to add the skills section.
Now, we'll start by adding a div and a p
tag that says technologies I work with.
Then, we're going to add another div
that is going to have a div that renders
that list. Now, we're doing a little bit
of a trick here with that list. We're
going to make that list extremely Now,
we're going to do a little bit of a
trick here with that list. I'm going to
make that into a copy into a different
list that has the same skills twice. So,
I'm going to use this, which basically
puts the entire list inside of here, and
then do it again. Remember, I'm just
using the skills array that we created
here. Now, did it not actually use it?
Uh, oh, I forgot to put curly braces to
use JavaScript. Then, I want to map
through this. get each skill and each
index and then render a div that inside
of it will have a span and render the
individual skill. Now it looks like this
and definitely that's not how we want it
to look. But first let's set the key to
be the index and then we'll start by
building the top here. We'll set a class
name of margin top of 20 to create some
space. Then we'll use the animate fade
in with a delay of 600. Then on this
paragraph tag, I'm going to set the text
to be small, the solid color to be
muted, foreground, margin bottom of six,
and a text center. Then on this div, I
want to set the position to be relative,
and the overflow to be hidden. Then on
this div, we're going to set the display
to be flex. And here's the kicker.
Everything now appears one right next to
each other. But we want to make them
animate by moving from one side to the
other, right? So, we're going to have to
make a really cool animation. We're
going to call this animate marquee just
like this. Now, to create this
animation, we'll come here and we'll
create the marquee key frames. It just
basically says that at the start, the
item will be at the middle and or
wherever it's supposed to be and then it
will move 50% to the left. When it moves
50% to the left, because the list has
the items twice, the other items should
be appearing at a certain point. So it
will never look like the end the list is
ending or the animation is ending
because it will constantly be moving and
reappearing at the other side. Now we
also want to create the animate class.
So I'll create here the animate market
class. We're making it actually take
forever 30 seconds because it will look
a lot smoother. As you can see, we'll
make it linear and infinite so that it
never stops and then it keeps going to
the left and then it will never actually
stop. Now the next thing we need to do
is actually apply some styles so that
this doesn't look disgusting like it
does right now. So we'll start with
this. We're going to set the uh class
name for the entire div to flex shrink
zero. So it doesn't actually uh you know
tailwind CSS doesn't appear with the CSS
below. Then we're setting a padding x of
eight and a padding y of four. That
looks a lot better already. Now for
individual skills I want to set the text
to be excel, the font to be semi-bold,
the text to be muted foreground, and
then make that be 50% opacity. Then when
you hover it, I want to make it be text
muted foreground so that when you hover
it, it becomes a little bit more clear.
But also, I'm applying the transition
colors which will make it such that it
it's a little bit smoother when I do
hover it. Perfect. This is pretty much
done. There's just one more thing. If
you look over here, when we have this,
just one more thing. If you look here,
we have this little scroll button where
it has this animation and when I click
on it, it actually should scroll for me.
Now, I'm in mobile mode, so this doesn't
really matter that much, but we're going
to add that scroll indicator. Now, I'm
going to copy and paste that scroll
indicator because I didn't make that one
just for this website. I always use the
same scroll indicator. I'll just go over
what it means. Now, what we do is we go
right below the section and we copy and
paste this class and import this icon at
the top. I'm just going to go up here
and then import the chevron down icon.
Now, I'll explain what each of these
means. Basically, if I go down here, you
see it appears now on the top div here.
We set the position to be absolute
because we need to make it at the
absolute bottom and middle. We also made
it be the last thing to appear. And when
you click on it, it takes you to the
about which is going to be the next
section we're going to be building. Then
it's simple uh display flex just making
it appear at the bottom. And here's what
we do. This chevron down, right, this
icon. The reason why it's bouncing is
because there is a default animation in
Tailwind CSS called animate bounce. By
setting animate to bounce, it creates
this little bouncing animation on
whatever element you create. Now, that
should pretty much be it. But I don't
know if you guys noticed something.
There's one thing that we should have
addressed before, but we never did.
However, we never did. Not because I
forgot, but because I wanted to present
the issue before showing the solution,
and that is that when you scroll down,
you see that the navbar overlaps with
everything and it looks really ugly. I
don't know if you thought that this was
how it's supposed to be. It's not right
now. To address that, we're going to
actually come to our navbar and we need
to make some changes to it. This is the
final result. When the user scrolls, it
will actually set a background with the
glassy look to it. Now, to do that,
here's what we have to do. We have to
detect if the user has scrolled or not.
Now, to do that, we're going to create
another state over here and call it is
scrolled. It's a boolean that determines
if the user scrolled or not, and it's
going to be true or false. Now, to
actually detect to see if the user
scrolled, it's pretty simple. We have to
set a use effect which is going to run
at the start of when the component first
renders. Now we need to make sure to add
an empty dependency array here or else
it will break our website. Then I want
to subscribe to an event. What event do
I want to subscribe? I want to subscribe
to listen to whenever the user scrolls
their mouse. To do that I attach to the
window and add an event listener. I want
to listen to when the user scrolls. Now
I want to call a function every time the
user scrolls that handles something. So
I'll create here a handle scroll
function that is going to be called
every single time the user scrolls
through the page even if it's the
smallest amount of scroll. Now what do I
want to do here? Well, if the user has
scrolled right uh below the height of
this navbar which is 50 then we know
that they scrolled past it and now
something should be happening. So this
should become true. So if the windows
scroll y is greater than 50 that's how I
detect it then I want to set is scrolled
to true else I'll set it to false or I
could also just make simplifies this
this logic and write it like this now
because we edit an event listener we
want to prevent memory leaks in react by
returning and unsubscribing to this
event listener when the component
unmounts or else it's going to subscribe
to that event and maybe I don't know for
for some reason the component will
unmount and it will never unsubscribe.
So by adding this logic over here where
the return it returns a callback
function this lets us remove the event
listener at the stage in which the
component is unmounted. Now we have that
logic but what do we do with it? Well to
start things off let's go to this header
class name that we put right at the
beginning and in here we're going to
change this to actually be dynamic. So,
I'm going to put dynamic classes and I
want to check to see if the and I'll put
it right over here. If the user has
scrolled, then I don't want to set the
BG to be transparent and the petting Y
to be five. Actually, I want to do
something else. If the user haven't
scrolled, I want to do that. So, I'll do
this. Now, if the user has scrolled,
then I want to set the background to be
of glass strong, that class we created,
and also the padding in the Y direction
to be three. You notice now that when I
scroll, absolutely nothing happens
still. Oh, actually it does. See?
Perfect. It sets the background to be
glass strong. Now, there's a little bit
of an animation as you can see over
there of fitting in when we do reach the
top. So, we can still do that for now.
It already looks kind of good when we do
this. Now, how do we get that smooth
animation? Well, it's pretty simple. By
adding here a transition all, uh, I'll
put it over here right before this
transition all. We're basically telling
Tailwind that there's going to be a
transition on this thing. And whenever
it changes, we want to set a specific
duration for how long we want that to
happen. I'm going to set it to 500. So
you see it adapts in right in front of
us. Perfect. And by the way, this is the
page in normal mode. So like not in
mobile mode. Already looks very cool.
And that's pretty much it for the hero
section. Now we have to create the about
section, the project section, the
experience section, and the
testimonials. But don't worry because
the first few sections are always the
most time consuming. The rest are going
to come a lot easier. So let's close
this off and let's start with the about
section. I'll come over here and we'll
start by defining um what do we want to
talk about ourselves. If you go to the
final product over here, you'll see that
it has obviously a bunch of text, but it
also has some like individual features
and highlights that you want to make
about yourself. So there's here that I
write clean code that I'm good with
performance. I improve performance of
websites. I'm good at collaboration and
innovation. So what I want to do is I
want to create a list on this about page
that is going to keep track of those
highlights. So I'll create here
highlights and for each highlight we
want to keep track of the icon used for
the highlight, the title and the
description. So for the icon I'm just
going to write this first one. I'm going
to use the code to icon. It's this icon
over here. Uh the title I'm going to say
clean code and then for the description
I'm gonna just put whatever is over here
as a string. So make this for you and
also add four of them. I'll just copy
and paste all four of them and I'll be
back in a second. Perfect. I just added
the four of them but we're not even
going to touch them right now. Let's
just start building the infrastructure
of this. So to start off I want to
create a div inside of here. Now this
div is going to separate this section
into two. Right? So, I'll create another
div here. And we're going to have the
left column, which is going to be some
text. Now, for the left column in the
about section, we want to have a text,
right? We're going to have the title of
the section. Uh, it should be inside of
here. So, I'll make a div. And then
inside of this div, we're going to make
a span that will have the text for the
title. Now, this should appear down
here. It will create some space.
Actually, I'll already do that. I'll set
this to have a padding Y of 32, position
to be relative, and the overflow to be
hidden. Then you'll see that it will
have a lot more space. Now, we also want
to make this into a section. What do I
mean by that? Well, when I click on the
about section, right, I want to be taken
to the about section. So to do that, I
need to set this to have an ID of about.
Because if you remember from our navbar,
when I click on each of the links, it
takes us to the hashtag and then the
name of the link. If you're familiar
with how links work, this means it will
scroll down to whatever element in your
page has that ID. So if I click here on
the about, it should scroll down to the
about section. Now, one thing that I
just want to do real quick before we
continue, if you notice, I want to also
close the navbar when I click on the
link, right? So I can actually do that
in mobile. So if I go to the to the
mobile nav over here, I can add an
onclick to this and make it such that if
you click on any of the links, it's
going to set is mobile menu open to
false. Same thing with the contact but
button, which right now we don't have
the actual section for uh the contact
section. We'll create that. But for now,
at least when we click on this, it
should close it. So let's try again. I'm
going to go to the about section. You
see it also closes that menu. Perfect.
Now, let's go back over here and let's
continue. Now, the next section I want
to put here is the headline. So, it's
going to be an H2 tag that is going to
say something like this. Building the
future. And then below this, we're going
to add a span that is going to say
another type of tagline. I'm going to
say one component at a time since this
developer here is a React developer. So,
what is this? Well, it's this section
over here. about me is going to be the
small title of the section and then
building the future one component of at
a time. That's why we separated the
first part of the H2 tag and this pen
because this spen should be in a
different font. Now we want to actually
apply this. Now one thing you might
notice is that uh there is no spacing
between building the future one
component at a time. It's because there
is actually no spacing here. We can
force it by adding that or we could also
just add an empty space over here by
doing this. But I think you guys will
understand better if I just do it like
this cuz then there's a little bit of a
space. Now before we continue, let's
actually start adding the rest of the
classes. So over here on this div, I'm
going to add a class name. We're going
to say that this is a container and that
the margin X is auto. You notice that
now when we also add a padding ax of
six. There going to be some space. And
then we'll set the position to be
relative and the zindex to be 10. Then
on this part of the column over here,
we're going to set everything to be a
display grid. Now depending on we're
going to do the same style that we did
before where if this is opened up, it's
going to be two columns. If it's uh
mobile, it's going to be just one
column. So to do that, what we have to
do is when it's anything less than a
large screen, it will just have one
column. But when it's large and above,
we're going to set the grid calls to be
two. Then we'll set a gap of 16 in
between the different items, and we want
to center them. Perfect. Now for the le
uh the left column, I'm going to set a
space in the y direction of 8. And I'm
going to add a another div. Actually,
this was a mistake. I need to add
another div over here. And then close
this div over here. And then on this
div, I want to set the class name to
just animate fade in. So it has that
little animation that we created. Then
on this span, I want to set the text
color to be secondary foreground, the
text to be small, the font to be medium,
the tracking to be wider, and I'll also
uppercase this. I could also just make
it uppercase, but I'll force it to be
uppercased. Then for this H2 tag over
here, it's going to be a lot more. We're
going to make the text be 4 XL in small
screens. Then on medium screens, we're
going to make that be 5 XL. And then the
font will be bold. The leading will be
tight. We're going to animate fade in.
But because this is going to be the
second animation, we're going to have to
put a delay of 100. And we're going to
set the color to be secondary
foreground, which will make it uh the
green. However, only the first part
should be green. This part should
actually be white and also be a
different font. So, we'll come to this
pen. We're going to first change the
font by saying font serif. And now it
should be this little really cool font.
We're going to make italic. And then I'm
going to set the font to be normal. And
so it's not bold. And then I'm going to
set the text to be white. Perfect. Now,
you want to put a very large section
talking about yourself, like actually
talking about yourself for those who are
interested in reading. Now, you can add
whatever you want, but it's going to go
below this H2 over here. And I just
going to copy and paste what I wrote
here. You can put something that makes
sense for you, but make it into three
separate paragraphs or how many
paragraphs you want to put. Then for
this div, we're going to set the space Y
to have a gap of four. So each paragraph
has a space in between them. Then we're
going to set the color to be muted
foreground. So it is that same gray. And
then we're going to set the animate fade
in and the animation delay to be more
than 100. So 200. So here's how it
looks. See how it appears way better?
Perfect. Now let's have a section that's
going to be acting as if like it's a
mission statement. See, my mission is to
create, you know, whatever you you don't
have to make it as corny as what I made
over here, but make it to be something
that it stands out whenever the uh
reviewers or whoever is trying to hire
you checks your website. So, below this
div over here, I'm going to add a div
for the mission statement. I'm going to
add a p tag, and I'll copy and paste the
mission statement. Now, what styles do
we want? Well, I want to make the whole
div to be a glass. I also want to make
it be very rounded, but not fully
rounded, just very big because it's very
wide. I'm going to put a padding of six,
so there's some space to it. It looks
like a card. Then I want to set that
glow border effect that we created. And
I want to set the animate fade in and
set the delay that is more than the last
one we did, which was 200. We're going
to make it 300 this time. Then on this
paragraph, I want to set the text to be
large, the font to be slightly bold, so
I'll say medium, and then I'll set the
font to be italic and the color to be
foreground. Perfect. Now, we're almost
done. We just have to set up everything
for the right column. The right column
is going to have the highlights. Now,
just in case you're confused, when I say
right column and left column, it's just
for the desktop mode. In mobile, it's
going to be all in one column. But this
is what we want to build is the
highlights. Right now, we added this
already and we're finally going to use
it. We created this array over here. So,
we're already ready to go to be able to
make this. So, what we want to do is we
want to create a div that will have a
class name of grid. And on even on a
small screen, but above that, we're
going to set it to be two columns. We're
also setting a gap of six in between
them. And then inside of this div, we're
just going to loop through the
highlights, map each of them, get each
item and their index. And then for each
item, each highlight, I want to render a
div that is going to have another div
inside with the icon of the highlight.
Right? We know that each highlight has
an icon, a title, and a description.
We'll start with the icon. We're just
going to render it. And since it's a
component to render it, we have to say
item do icon and then self close the
component. Now there is an error here.
It's just because uh we have to close
this div. So we'll close it. And now we
only see all four icons. We also want to
see the title and the description. For
the title, I'm going to add an H3 and
just render the item.title. Then below
this, I'm going to add a P tag that will
render the item.escription. Perfect. Now
I want to add the styles for this. I'll
start by adding a key which will be the
index. And then for the class name, I
want to set this to have each of them
have a glass background, a padding of
six, a rounded to XL, similar to what we
did with this. Then we're going to set
the group because then we'll apply a no.
Then I want to set an animate fade in so
that they all animate and fade in
together. However, I want them to fade
in in a sequential manner. What do I
mean by that? When I want them to fade
in, I don't want them to appear all at
the same time. I want them to appear
this first, then this, then this, then
this. To make that sequential order
inside of a list, there's a couple ways
to do it. Doing it in uh Tailwind
requires us to do a bunch of stuff that
uh would be overly complicated. So, we
can just do it very easily through this
style because what we can do is we can
set an animation delay over here. And
what we can do is we can set the delay
to be a certain amount of milliseconds.
And that certain amount can be an
increment of hundreds of milliseconds.
But that means that this one should be
should appear at 100 milliseconds of
delay. This one 200, this one 300, this
one 400. The way we make this is we are
inside of a list. So we can just get the
index of each of them in the array and
multiply it times 100 because then uh
for example uh this first one over here
it will have index zero. So that
wouldn't be a really good thing for us
to do. What we could do instead is do
get the index add one to it. So it will
have a one time 100 that would make it
into 100 milliseconds. Right? If I
multiply this times 100 now this string
becomes 100 millconds and the delay is
100 millconds. This one should have
index of 1 which 1 + 1 is 2 * 100 is 200
milliseconds and so on. This should have
300 and this 400. And now you should see
that if I refresh this it appears in
kind of like sequential order. Perfect.
Now we'll come to this div over here
with the icon and we're going to do a
couple things. We're going to set the
width to be 12, the height to be 12 and
for the whole thing to be very rounded.
Then we're going to set the bg color of
it to be primary but we don't want it to
be super uh green. We're just going to
give it 10% opacity. Then I'll set the
display to flex because the icon is not
centered. So I'll just set it to be
center. And I'll also justify it to be
center. So it's also centered
horizontally. Then a margin bottom of
four. And then I'll set a hover where
when you hover it, it's going to set the
BG to be primary but 20 so that there's
a small hover effect when you hover each
of the icons. Perfect. Now we also want
to apply individual colors. So on this
icon over here, we're going to set the
width of it to be six, the height to be
six, but then the color is going to be
text primary. So the icon is green is
green. Then for this H3 tag over here,
it's not going to be much. We're just
going to set the text to be large, the
font to be semibold, and we're going to
set a margin bottom of two. Then on the
B tag, I'm just going to set the text to
be small, and the text to be muted
foreground to make it gray. Perfect. And
that's pretty much it for the about
section. Now we have this beautiful
about section that works both in desktop
mode and also in mobile. Now it's time
for us to build the project section. So
I'm going to come over here, go to the
project section, and we'll start by
defining which projects we want to have
in our website. To do that, I'm going to
create here an array called projects,
similar to what we did with the
highlights. Now, each project will have
the following. It's going to have a
title. It's going to have a description.
I'm just going to already add the
titles. Um the first example project I'm
going to add is going to be fintech uh
dashboard but you add whatever
information for which project you have.
Then for description I have this over
here. It's a comprehensive financial
analytics whatever it's just like a
normal description for your project.
Then below this we're going to set an
image. Now add the images that you want.
If you want to use my images remember
they're not actually related to the
project itself. They all exist in the
public folder inside of a folder called
projects. I added projects that I've
built for my YouTube channel. Uh, but
you should add whatever you prefer. Now,
to access them, I'll start by saying
projects slash and then access the
project number.png.
Then I'll add in a list of tags. These
are tags that are related to the
project. So, if you go to the list of
projects here, you see that they have
little tags at the bottom. So, I'm going
to add that by adding a list and then
adding whatever technologies you use
like React, TypeScript, and I don't
know, I'm not I'm going to use Node.js.
JS and then below this you add a link.
The link should probably be to the demo
website that you have this. I'm just
going to put a an empty link. I don't
have anything for this. And also a
GitHub link which you put the link to
the repository. Highly recommend that
you do this. This is pretty much it. You
do this for all of your projects. And
when you're done, you should be able to
have a list like the following. Perfect.
Just this list over here. We have
another example here. an e-commerce
platform, an AI writing assistant, and a
project management tool. You make
however many projects you want, and then
we're ready to get started. So, what I
want to do first is the same thing we
did here on the about section. Most
sections are going to start pretty much
the same thing. It's going to have an ID
and it's going to have these classes.
Also, I'll also copy this just so that
we can also have that. And I'll put it
directly over here. Uh, that means that
I also have to close this div. So, I'll
do that. And I'll put some space here
cuz it looks like everything is broken.
What did we do here? Well, we created a
we give an ID for this section. I'm
going to call it projects. And we just
set the padding Y to be 32. Same thing
we did before. And we created a
container inside of it. Then what I want
to do is outside of this container, I
want to add some background accents.
They're going to be like background
glows that are going to exist. And I'm
just going to copy and paste them just
because we already worked on making one
for the this section over here. And it's
pretty much the same thing. It's just a
little section glow that appears at the
top and it should really give a nice
like nice accent to the page. Then
inside of this div, what we're going to
do is the following. We're going to
build out the section header, which is
going to be pretty much very similar to
also the one for the about page, uh,
where we have a section just like this,
where it's going to have a title and
it's going to have this H2 here with the
spans. Now to do that I'm going to
create here a div then a span and I'm
going to say featured work. Then below
the span I'm going to add an h2 which is
going to say projects that and then I'm
adding a span giving a space and say
make an impact just like this. Now we
want to do the same thing we did here
where we do this but we want to center
it this time so it gives a little bit of
a a different feel to it. So to do that,
I'm going to first set a class name to
this where I'm going to center the text.
Then I'm going to set the margin X to be
auto. And I'll set the max width to be
uh 3 XL. A margin a margin bottom of 16.
And then below on this featured work
span, I'm going to set the color to be
secondary for ground. A text is going to
be small and the font is going to be
medium with a tracking that is going to
be wider. We're gonna uppercase it and
we're going to add the animation. So,
animate fade in. Perfect. Then on this
H2, we're going to make the text be way
bigger for Excel, but then on larger
screens, we're going to make that be
five. We're going to set the font to be
bold and the margin top to be four with
a margin bottom to be six. Then, we're
going to add the animation with a delay
of 100 cuz this is the f the second
thing on the section. Now, we're also
setting the color to be four or
secondary foreground. Perfect. Now, we
just want to differentiate a bit the
make an impact section just like we did
on the about one. I'm just going to come
here and I'm going to copy the same
class we had here and then just paste it
in this pen. Perfect. Now, we can just
add a P tag that it goes below this H2
tag and it will be the small description
of the section. You can put a like just
a sentence or two uh to describe what
the section is. I'm going to say it's a
selection of my recent work from complex
web applications to innovative uh tools
that solve real world problems. We want
to make that be not that um standing out
on the page cuz the title should do
that. So I'm going to make the color be
the gray color. So muted foreground and
then I'm going to set the animate fade
in and a delay of 200. Then we're pretty
much done with this section. Now the
next section is going to be the projects
grid where we show all the projects. But
on a bigger screen, it should show the
projects in a two columns. And a smaller
screen, they should show up one on top
of each other. So to do that, what I
want to do is I want to create the div.
And I want to set the class name to be
grid. And similar to what we've done
multiple times already, I'm going to set
the on a medium screen and above to have
two columns. And I'll set a gap of eight
in between each of them. Now, we're
going to render each of them by looping
through the projects array. We'll map
through it. Get each project. Get the
index. And then I'll start by rendering
a div. This div will have the following.
I'm going to close it. And then I'll
have a div in here. And this will serve
as the div for the image, right? The
image of the project. And on this div,
I'll just show the image. I'll render it
by saying source and then applying in
the source a project do image. Then I'll
show the alt to be a the title of the
project. And you'll see that now all
three images the all four images appear.
Then I want to set the class name of it
to have a width full, height full, and
for it to be object cover. And I want to
set the there to be a transition
transform with a duration of 700 because
what I want to do is when I hover it, I
want it to actually scale the image a
bit. But to do that, I want it to be a
group scale. So I'm going to apply that
uh logic actually to this div at the top
over here. So to do that we'll apply a
key. I'm going to do index and then
we're going to add a class name. And in
here I'm going to set a class name of
group. Then glass. Then I'm going to set
it to be rounded to Excel. We're going
to set the overflow to be hidden. When
you hover it, uh actually not when you
hover it, but there's going to be a
animate fade in. And I'm setting the
medium uh on a media screen and above.
I'm going to set the span of the row to
be one. Now it applies to everything,
but then we want to do that same logic
that we did before with the about
section where each of them has a small
delay depending on the index, this style
over here. So we'll copy that. We're
going to apply it to this div. And then
in the image section, here's what we
want to do. We want to set the class
name to be relative. Then the overflow
to be hidden. And I'm going to set the
aspect to be video. So all of them has
similar heights. It kind of zooms in a
bit so that it all fits on this aspect
ratio. Then I want to set the hover
where when I hover it, it should expand
just like this. To do that, it's
actually not that hard. We set the
transition to be transform and the
duration to be 700. 700 is the amount of
milliseconds that it takes to actually
expand. What I do then is I'm going to
set a group hover and set the scale to
be 110. 110 meaning one 10% more than
100 which is its original scale. And now
all of them will scale very smoothly. If
you want to make it even more smoother,
you can just increase this value to 900
or whatever. If you want to make it
quicker, you can make it at 100 and then
it goes very quick. But 700 is the sweet
spot in my opinion. Now what we do is we
have this image. I want to just add a
little uh gradient that should go around
the image. I'm going to apply it just
like this. It's an a gradient that goes
from the top to the bottom and it kind
of fades in the image so that it doesn't
like stand out that much since the
colors might not match the color of our
website. Then I want to add the overlay
link. It's this links that appear over
here and it should take you either to
the demo or to the GitHub. Now to do
that, I'm going to add a section here
over lay links. And I'll add a div that
will render a a tag for the demo, which
should be just an arrow. I'm going to
use the arrow up right icon. It's an
arrow on the upright direction. So it
should appear over here. Uh it's
currently not appearing anywhere, I
think, but it will appear later. And
then we'll add another link, but this
one is for the GitHub. So I'll change
this to say GitHub. Now, to make them
appear, I'm going to actually have to
make this be position absolute. And then
try to center them. I'm going to set the
inset to be zero. And now they're over
here. Then I'm going to set the display
to be flex. Uh the items to be center.
Justify center. And then I'm going to
set the gap in between them to be four.
So there's a space opacity to be zero.
Now you might be wondering why did I
make it opacity zero? It doesn't make
any sense. Well, only when you hover it,
then the opacity becomes 100. So you see
only when I hover it, it actually
appears. Then I want to set the
transition opacity. So we decide how
long we want that opacity transition to
be. I'm going to make it 300 so it goes
in a bit slowly as well. Great. Now in
this a tag, I'll put an href. That
should take them to whatever their demo
website is. So I'll say project.link to
link that. Then for the class name, I'll
set a simple padding to be three. I'll
make it look like a circle. So rounded
full. I'll set it to be glass as the
background. So it looks like this as you
can see. And then the last thing is I
want to make it such that when you hover
it, the BG will become primary and also
the color will become the foreground of
a primary background. And I'll set a
transition all at the end. Perfect. For
the icon, I'll just set the width to be
five and the height to be five as well.
Now we want to copy this, paste it over
here. I'll even copy this as well. Paste
it over here. We'll change this to just
say GitHub. Now you see that I can go on
each of them and click on it and it
should take the you somewhere. Now I
honestly didn't put a link, so that's
why it's taking me to the start, but it
works on every single one of this
images. Perfect. Now, what do we want to
do? We want to add the content for the
project. So this section over here at
the bottom. So, we'll go down to divs
below that the overlay links and we'll
render the content. Now, for the
content, I'll add a div. Also, close a
div over here. And inside of this div,
I'll add another div. Close that one as
well. And I'm going to add an h3 tag
that has the project.title.
Then I'll add an arrow up right similar
to how we did with the overlay link. And
that will serve as actually a indication
that you can click on it to go
somewhere. Then below this div, I'm
going to add a p tag that shows the
project description. Then below this uh
p tag, I'm going to add another div. And
in here, we want to do a loop inside of
this loop. We want to loop through the
list of tags and render them
individually. So I'm going to say
project.tags
dom. And then for each tag, I'm going to
get it. I'm also going to get the tag
index. We can't call it index because uh
we already have we're already inside of
a loop that has a index variable. And
then we're going to return for each tag
a span that should represent that tag.
So I'll just show the tag in here. And
now we should see just the tags
appearing as uh words, right? It's a
list, but it appears as a word. Now
we're pretty much done adding the stuff
for the content, but all the styles
should go in, or else this will look
very ugly. For the content, I'm going to
set the padding to be six and there to
be a gap in the Y direction between each
of the different sections. Already a lot
better. Then here, I'll set the display
to be flex, the items to be start, but I
want to justify between so that the name
of the project and this link have a huge
space in between them. One is on the
side and the other one is in the other.
Then on this H3 tag, I'm going to set
the text to be Excel, the font to be
semi-bold, and then I'll set a group
hover, which should have a text primary,
and I'll set the transitions to be
colors. Then we are good with the title,
but for this up arrow, right, I'm going
to apply a bunch of class names. It's
pretty much the same class names we
added for the other icons. Uh, so I'll
just keep it the same like this. So you
can take a look at it. But basically the
main difference here is that when we
hover it, we translate it uh a bit to
the right. That's how you translate
stuff on a hover in Tailwind. You set it
translate on the X direction by one and
on the Y direction by one. So when I
hover this, this should move one to the
right and one up and it has this really
cool effect. Then I want to add a class
name for the description. In here I'll
set the text to be muted foreground and
the text to be small. Then on this div,
I want to set the class name to be a
display flex. Then I'm going to set a
flex wrap in case any of the text have a
a line that breaks and a gap of two in
between them so they don't look like
they're all one word. Now for each tag,
what I want to do is I want to set the
padding X to be four and then also a
very small padding Y because a pill
usually is more wide than it is tall.
Then I'm going to make it be rounded
full. And I'll make the uh BG to have a
color of surface. If you remember,
surface is one of the colors that we
defined right at the beginning. It's
just a variation of the other colors
that we have. Then what I want to do is
after this, I want to set the text to be
extra small. Uh a font to be medium. And
I want to set the border for it to be a
border. But that color should have the
default border color that we defined in
the beginning. but only 50% opacity of
that. So, it's barely visible, but it
does have some effect to it, especially
when we add the hovering. I also make
the color be muted foreground. And then
I'm going to set a hover where when you
hover it, the border is going to become
primary. And then divide that by 50. So,
it's basically it's currently very slow.
And then when I hover it, it becomes the
green color that we are all used to.
Also, let's change the color of the text
when we hover. So, when you hover it,
we'll set the text to be primary. We'll
set it to have a transition just because
it's all very messed up. Transition of
everything will have a duration of 300.
You see that now when I hover it, it has
a lot of a smoother effect. Perfect. I
also want to use this tag index as the
key cuz remember we have to do that in
React. Now we're pretty much done with
the project section. There's just one
small thing which is in case you want to
link like your entire GitHub, I don't
know, you want to take them to every
single project you've ever built,
there's going to be this button for view
all projects. It's very similar to the
button we have here for download CV.
That's why I created that as a component
so that we can just reuse it very
quickly. So I want to go to that
download the animated border button that
we created. I'm going to copy this. I'll
come back here and then below this div
uh but not still inside of the last div
and inside of the section I want to add
the view all call to action. I'll add a
div that should render the animated
border. Is that not even going to show
up? Yeah, animated border button. And
then I have to import that. So I'll come
over here. I'll import from and then
I'll do at slash components slashan
animated border button. And I'll import
the animated border button. Now we have
to put a it shouldn't be self-closing.
It should be it should allow me to put a
text here. But if you remember when we
created this animated border button over
here, we didn't make it such that it
accepts children so that we can
customize the the actual info inside of
it. So we want to change that. I'm going
to remove this or I'm going to add a
children as part of the props. And I'm
going to make the children here be what
is rendered instead of this label. I'll
keep this exactly the same, but I'll
just render the children here. Then I'm
going to copy this and I'm going to put
it back on the hero section which is
where we call it the first time. So
where we call the animated border button
instead of making it self-closing, I'm
just going to do this where I paste that
over here. Then we'll import this
download icon as part of what we import
from Lucid and it should keep it the
same. But what that means is that now we
can pretty much do the same thing for
this view all button. I'll come here to
where we have our projects and I'm going
to add the following. It's going to be
the view all projects and the arrow
upright which is that same icon we
already have where we set the text to be
center a margin top to be 12. Then we're
going to animate fade in and we're going
to set a delay in that animation to be
of 500. Perfect. Now we have this
beautiful project section created and
we're almost done with the website. Like
I said, this website takes a lot longer
in the beginning to build, but after
that, we already have a lot of the
initial uh knowledge set up. Now, as you
can see, the only stuff that we have
left is to add the experience section,
the testimonials, and the contact and
the contact. So, we're going to do that
really quick. Okay. So, now let's make
the experience section. This section is
pretty interesting because it shows a
timeline of events of your previous jobs
or I don't know anything notable,
curriculum, studies, whatever you want
to put. To start things off, we want to
create a list that is going to represent
the different experiences we have. Uh
similar to what we did with the projects
and also with the highlights. So I
already created my list and I want you
to create something similar. It's going
to be a list called experiences and it's
going to have objects inside of it. Now
we want to put uh the following. the
period of when that experience happened.
So you should make it in order where
like the oldest experience is at the
bottom of the list and the latest it's
at the top. So you see the bottom one
goes from 2018 to 2019, the current one
goes from 2022 to present. Then you put
the role if you were just an engineer, a
student, whatever, the company name, the
description of the job, the list of
technologies, and if it is current or
not. Technically only one of them should
be current unless you are multi-jobbing
which I don't know maybe you are. So,
make sure to put false as current for
all the other ones. And then only one of
them will be true. Now, we can start
building the section. We're going to
copy the same intro to the section as we
did with the about in the projects page.
And we're going to set the ID to be
experience. Then, inside of here, we
want to add a background glow similar to
what we did with the project section.
This one will be uh as follows. You can
add it if you want to, and it should
look a bit like this. Then below this,
we're going to add the same kind of
container like div that we added also on
the projects and on the um about
section. Both this, this and this, they
were all done exactly the same as how we
did on the other section. So you can
just copy and paste. Another thing that
is very similar is if you go over here,
you see that uh this section over here
is very similar to not the one from
projects, but the one from the about me.
So we're already kind of used to doing
that. Now to structure this, we're going
to have here the section header. And
we're going to put here a div that
should have a class name of max width of
uh 3 XL. And I'm going to set a margin
bottom to be 16. Then in this div, I
want to set here a span that is going to
say career journey. Then a section that
is going to have a title. So we're going
to say experience that. and then put a
span like we did before because this
part is going to be with italics. We're
going to say speaks volumes. Put a space
in between this so it actually has a
space. And we're good to go. Now for the
classes, we're going to just copy and
paste the classes that we added for uh
the about and project section. For this
span, we're going to add a uh a text
secondary to make it have be green. And
we're also going to uppercase it and
animate the whole thing in. For the H2,
we're going to add a lot more. We want
to make it big and fully uh primary and
also add a small animation delay to it.
Finally, for the span, we want to add
the italic and the font serif so that it
it stands out as well. Now, the next
thing I want to do is add a small
paragraph. We've done this on the other
sections as well. So, I'll just copy and
paste it. And it should go below the H2
tag. It's just going to have a text
muted foreground. And it should animate
with a delay of 200 so that it comes
after the first part of the title.
Great. Now we're done with the section
header. So we're going to go down a div
and we are going to build the timeline.
Now to build the UI for the timeline,
it's going to be a bit different from
what we've done because it's a very
specific UI and there's a lot of cool
effects that we have to put. To start
things off, I'm going to set a container
div that is going to be position
relative. Then I'm going to add the
vertical line. This vertical line is
going to be this line that shows up over
here. You see, it's a vertical line that
goes from the top of the section to the
bottom and it slowly fades out as it
goes down. To do this effect, we're
going to create this vertical line
that's going to have a class of timeline
glow. Now, what even is that? Well,
that's a class we need to create on our
utilities class. Now, I'm going to put
it over here. I'll come down at the
bottom, and I'm going to add this
utility class. It's just a box shadow,
and it's going to have a color mix of
our primary color to transparent. And
depending on the size, it's going to to
create this slowed fade in effect. Then
what we want to do is we want to come
back to the experience and we want to
make it such that this uh vertical line
has a position absolute. It's going to
start at the left zero. But the thing is
this is only in a small screen. In a
small screen in mobile it's going to be
at the left. But on a big screen it
should be at the bottom like at the
middle sorry with this two uh the
experiences like alternating which sides
they're in. So to make this kind of
effect we'll set the medium to be at the
middle. When you're using position
absolute to center stuff, you set it to
be left and then you make it to be 1/2.
So it's 1/2 of the screen. Then what we
have to do is set it to be at the top.
So top zero and also bottom zero. Then
the width is going to be very small.
It's so small that I want to specify it
in pixels. It's going to be two pixels.
We want to set a background to it so
that you guys can even see what we're
talking about. But we're going to be
using a gradient that goes from the top
to the bottom. And that's what creates
the effect of literally disappearing,
right? Together with the glow. Now, this
gradient will start with the color
primary, but not fully primary, like not
the full green color. It's actually
going to be 70% opacity. Then, it's
going to go through the color primary in
the middle, but then at 30% opacity, and
then finally, it's going to end being
transparent. Now, we have to set a a
translation to it when we are in a
medium screen and above so that it's
fully centered. So, we're going to use
the negative translate function the X
direction to be a half. Finally, I'll
also add a very specific shadow to this
item. Now, this shadow over here is
going to be the same color that we have,
but it's going to be uh a slight less
opacity as you can see. And I used RGBA
so that I could change the opacity
directly in the shadow. Now what we have
to do is we have to build the actual
section so that the because this is
going to be the size of this div but we
have nothing on this div. So it
basically doesn't show the line. If
there's nothing in the timeline then it
doesn't show anything. But if I were to
for example copy this paragraph tag over
here and add something it will have some
space. So you see the line actually
appears. But we don't want that. We want
to create the experience items. So I'll
show you here experience items. And to
do that, we want to use a div that will
have a class name of space y12. And then
in this div, I want to loop through the
experiences list. M map each of them,
get the experience and the index. And
then for each of them, I want to render
a div. To start things off with this
div, I want to set the key of it to be
the index already so I don't forget. And
then inside of this div, I want to
render another div that is going to
actually uh determine if the experience
is the current one or not. Why? Because
if it's the current, we're going to
apply this little pulsating animation,
which the other ones don't have. Now,
we're going to let that be for later.
So, I'm going to just create this div
and add here that this is the timeline
dot. Let's create the rest of this first
so that we can even see that. So, the
content is going to be the most
important part. So the content is going
to be a div that inside of it, it's
going to have another div and this inner
div is going to have a period section.
The period is going to be when this uh
experience was from till when. So I'm
going to render the experience period
which is just a text. So it should look
like this. Then below this uh period
section, we're going to add an H3 tag
that shows the row. So I'm going to say
experience row. Then another a P tag
this time that shows the company. So
experience company. And then below that
another P tag that shows the
description. And finally we need to
render the technologies. So for the
technologies I'm going to actually
create a div that should loop through
the list of technologies in the similar
way to what we did with the tags on the
project section. We're going to get the
experience say technologies do map
through them. Close this off. get the
TAC and also create the TAC index. Then
we're going to render each technology as
a pill similar to what we did before.
Going to add a spend that for now is
just going to render the TAC. Okay, we
have a bunch of stuff. Now, let's make
it look good. To make it look good,
we're going to start off right over
here. In this div, we're going to add a
class name where we're going to set this
to be actually a position relative uh
grid. And in a medium screen and above,
we're going to set this grid to have two
columns. Remember the columns are going
to alternate. There's going to be a gap
of eight in between them. And I'm also
going to use the animate fade in. Now
remember this all we don't want them to
appear at the same time. Every time we
add a fade in animation on a list, we
want to add that slight delay that
depends on the index. So what I'm going
to do is I'm just going to copy and
paste that same code we had uh used
multiple times already so that the
actual items appear one by one. Uh I
refreshed it and you couldn't see it,
but that's how it's going to look. If I
were to change this to say experience,
then you'll be able to see it better. Uh
let me refresh this. You see they appear
one by one. Then on the uh content
section, we're going to start by
actually making it such that this
content section has a dynamic class name
because it's going to depend especially
if we are in a big screen. It's going to
depend on whether or not you are on the
left or the right side of the screen.
How do we determine that? Well, let me
show you. If I open this up, you'll see
that there's just one column. But on
this content section over here, I'm
going to make it such that the first of
all, the padding in the left direction
is going to be eight. And on a medium
screen, that padding is going to be
zero. But then we're going to check to
see if the current index is even or odd.
Because if it's even, then we're going
to align everything to the right. And if
it's odd, we're going to align
everything to the left. That's how we
make it such that they alternate in a
medium screen. So we're going to check
to see if it's even by doing index
modulo two and if that leaves the
remainder is zero then we know that it
is even then we put here that in a
medium screen and that's the case the
padding right is going to be 16 and on a
medium screen and that's the case the
text will be aligned to the right so
it's going to be on the right of the
screen if not then we're going to do the
following we're going to set in a medium
screen because remember no matter what
this logic only happens if it's a medium
screen and above not in mobile we're
going to set the column start two and
we're going to set it also to have a
padding left of6. You see that now there
is a clear alternation between the
items. Now there's some a lot more stuff
that we want to do to make that look
good. So I'm going to go back to mobile
and we're going to start building the
rest in mobile because uh we don't
really care about desktop right now. But
at least you guys saw that this worked
in desktop. Now in this div, what we
want to do is we want to add a class
name that also is dynamic because it's
also going to have some logic like we
did over here. Now the general uh the it
doesn't matter what we're going to apply
is the background is going to be glass.
It's going to have a padding of six and
we're going to make it be very rounded.
It's a card, right? Then we're going to
set a border with a border color that is
actually primary at 30. It's not the
border border. Then when you hover it,
we just increase that border color to be
a little bit more visible. So at like
50. Then we're going to apply transition
all with a duration of 500. So
everything is very smooth. Finally, we
want to check to see if it's odd or
even. But actually, thinking more about
it, I don't think we even need that. Uh,
most of what this issue is is actually
we have to make one small change. But
for now, we should just leave it as it
is. Now, the main change that is caught
now, the main reason why it's broken
right now like this is just because we
haven't actually made the timeline dot.
Currently, this dot is part of the grid,
which it shouldn't be because it should
actually have a position of absolute so
it doesn't affect the rest of the
design. When I do that, you see that it
actually works. So, we just left that
for a little bit later, but I wanted to
fix that just so you guys don't have a
broken section. We're going to come back
to this in a second. Let's continue
building this section over here. And
we'll start by building the UI for the
period. For the period, we're going to
set the text. Uh, actually, I don't know
what happened here. Wait, we'll keep the
span or edit class name text to be
small. Then we're going to set the color
to be primary, and the font to be
medium. Then on this H3, we're going to
set the text to be Excel, the font to be
semi bold, and the margin top to be two.
On this P tag, we're going to set the
text to be just muted foreground. On
this other P tag, we're going to set the
text to be small and the color to also
be muted foreground. And also a margin
top of four. Finally, we get here to the
technologies on this section. We want to
set that the class name is going to be
dynamic. Now, why are we making it
dynamic? Because we're going to justify
it to the end if we are on a medium
screen and the thing is aligned to the
right. So, we'll set a display flex and
also flex wrap so it doesn't break the
line. We're going to set a gap of two
and a margin top of four. Then, we're
going to do that check where we check to
see if the index modulo 2 is equal to
zero. And if that's the case, then we're
just going to justify everything to the
right if it's in a medium screen. So
we'll justify end. If it's not, then we
don't do anything. Now, what happens is
we're going to come to this pen and
we're going to add a petting x of three,
a petting y of one to make it a pill so
it doesn't look too big. We're going to
set the bg to be surface like we made
that other pill. We're going to add the
text to be extra small. It's going to be
rounded full and the color is going to
be muted foreground. Perfect. Now I'll
also just add a key over here and make
it be t index. Perfect. You see looks
pretty good. I can hover it. It looks
fine. And on a bigger screen, it also
looks fine. There's just one small thing
I want to make, which is uh make the
dots that appear through the timeline.
If you remember on this version that we
have over here, there's the dots. And
obviously when it's the current one, it
should pulsate. To do that, we're going
to come here to this timeline dot that
we didn't touch before. And we'll just
add some styles to it. We'll start by uh
adding a position of it. Left is going
to be zero. On a medium screen, it's not
going to be zero because it's going to
be in the middle. So, I'm going to say a
half top zero. And I'll set it to have a
width and a height of three so that it
actually becomes a circle. I'll add the
color to be primary. Now, on each of
them, there should be one. And I'm going
to make it rounded so it's a circle. So,
I'm going to do rounded full. Then, I'm
going to translate X to be a half so
that it actually centers in the middle.
I'm adding a ring around it of four, but
I'm going to add the ring to be of color
background and then a zindex of 10. Now,
to make it pulsate, here's what we have
to do. We'll go inside of this div just
like this and we're going to check to
see if the experience current is true.
If that is, then I'll render another
span that is going to be inside of it.
Now, this span is self-closing. So, I'm
going to remove this and do this. Now,
what do we want to do with this span?
I'm going to add a class name of
position absolute insert zero rounded
full bg primary and then animate ping
which is going to start pinging. We also
want to set the opacity to be 75 just so
that it's not too obvious. Now it's a
little bit more smoother and you can see
perfect. That's pretty much it. Now this
section as you can see is the hardest
out of the last out of the next ones
that we're going to make. So, if you
want to practice the next ones without
continuing the video, feel free to do
so. But I'm going to show you guys how
to do everything. The next section is
going to be the testimonial section. In
this one, because it just reuses a lot
of the stuff that we've already learned
so far, I'll go a little bit faster. To
start off the bat, if you look over
here, you'll see that for each
testimonial, it's a card that appears in
the middle. It has a profile image, a
name, and also a description of who they
are. Now, all of the images I'm using
here are actually very commonly used
images. I always use them in projects.
they have a public URL and it's just I
don't know if it's fake people but
they're used everywhere in different
projects when you're trying to mock
something. Now, you don't need to put
images for people. You don't even need
to put the profile images or their name,
but it's good to have a testimonial so
people can vouch for you. And to create
this kind of thing, what I want to do
first is create an array of testimonials
like we did for all the other pages.
Now, this is what I want you to put on
that array. Each item in the array is
going to have a quote, an author name, a
row, and an avatar. If you don't want to
put their profile images, don't put the
avatar. If you want to use the same ones
as I did and pretend like it's a real
one, feel free to do so. I'm not in
control of you, but just use the URLs
that are over here. Then, we're going to
come down here and we'll start building
the section. The first thing we need to
build is the intro of the section, which
we've done multiple times as well. Just
make sure to change the ID to
testimonials. Then we want to add a like
a a glow around it just like just like
this. And it should look a bit like
this. Then we'll create the container
like we did on the other ones as well.
And now we're ready to go for the header
section. I'm not going to show myself
writing it because we've done it already
four times. But here is what you need to
put. This is the section header. This
time it's going to be centered like the
project one. You're going to apply a
text center, a max width, margin x auto,
and a margin bottom of 16. Then you do
the same kind of manipulation we did
with the spen for the first section. You
uppercase it. And then on this one you
use an H2 and a span to write like uh
the different fonts for you. One minor
change that I did was I used the this
notation of adding a empty space using
this instead of just adding it over
here. But you can do whatever you want.
Now we go down this div and we're going
to create the testimonial carousel. This
one I'll show myself doing it because
it's different from what we've done. Now
to create this testimonial carousel,
I'll create here a div and another div
and I'm going to create the main
testimonial. Now, now what is that?
Well, differently from how we rendered
lists in the past, we're not showing all
of the items at the same time. Actually,
we're only showing one at each time. So,
we just have to build a UI for that one.
Now, we have a list. So, we're going to
have to keep track of which of these
testimonials in the list we're going to
be showing at each time. At first, let's
just show the first testimonial, which I
believe is going to be this one over
here. So, we'll go back over here, and
for the main testimonial, I want to add
a div that is going to have a another
div. Now, this div is going to actually
be for the quote. Quote is an icon from
Lucid React. That should look like this
to indicate that this is a testimonial.
Then, below this quote, we're going to
add the actual quote. Based on how HTML
works, you can add quotes by adding the
block quote tag. Then in the block
quote, we're going to get the list of
testimonials. And for now, we're just
going to render the first one and get
the quote just like this. Then below
this block quote, we're going to render
information about the author. We're
going to first show their image if
applicable. If not, then just ignore it.
Uh for the image, we're going to show
the source here. We're going to apply
the testimonials. get the first one and
show the avatar. We're going to then
apply the alt. And for the alt, we're
going to do something similar. We're
just going to apply it just like this,
but not the avatar, but rather the
author name. Then, uh below this, we're
going to add a div that is going to show
more information about the author. Uh
we're going to show in this div the
actual uh name of the author. Again,
we're going to say author. And then
we're going to have another div below
this that is going to show the role of
that person. So I'm going to say
testimonial zero row. Perfect. Now let's
add the styles for this whole carousel.
We'll start by adding the top styles for
the carousel. Just this. We're going to
set the class name to be max width for
XL and a margin X of auto. Then on this
div, we're going to add a position
relative. Then I want to come to the
main testimonial and I'll make the
background be glass. Have a padding of
eight. And I'm going to set it to have a
very rounded corner. So 3 XL. Then I
want to go and make it so that in the
middle screen and above I'll make the
padding be bigger. And I'm going to set
the glow border so that it has that glow
in the border. Now I'm also going to
animate fade in and apply a delay of
200. Then in the quote icon I'm going to
set it to be completely absolute so it
doesn't affect the inside of it and it
appears over here. So I'll say position
absolute. I'm setting it to be at the
negative top four so it goes a little
bit up uh not an equal sign so it's over
here and then a little bit more to the
left so I'll just say left eight then
I'll set the width to be 12 and the
height to be 12 and for it to be rounded
full then a bg primary then I'm going to
put a display flex items center and
justify center then we can come down
here for the actual quote I'll change
the color cuz white is too strong and
then I'm going to put the width to be
six the height to be six so it's a bit
smaller and then I'm also going to make
it such that the color text primary uh
yeah primary foreground perfect now we
come down here to the block quote and
I'm going to add a text XL and make that
be to XL on larger screens make the font
be medium and we'll add a leading
relaxed with a margin bottom of eight
and a padding top of four perfect then
on this div I want to set the class name
to have a display flex item center and a
gap of four. Then on the image, I'm
going to set the class name to have a
width of 14, a height of 14, then a
rounded full, and an object cover with a
ring of two. And that ring be a primary
color with 20% opacity. So it creates
this little circle around. And because
it's object cover, the image goes inside
of that circle. Then on this div, we're
going to set the display to flex. We're
going to center the items. And we're
going to put a gap of four in between
them so they're spaced out. Now for the
author, I want to set the font to be
semibold. And on the other one, I want
to set the text to be small and the text
to be muted foreground. Now, this is one
way to show it, but if you want to show
it exactly how I show it over here,
where it goes below, some people prefer
either way, you just have to remove this
at the top as well. Now, we're pretty
much done with rendering this, but we
have to know how to switch between one
testimonial to the other. So, we're
going to add the navigation controls for
this testimonial section over here.
We're going to go down four divs. So,
just over here. And this will be uh
testimonial
uh navigations. Then, I'm going to
render a div, put a button, and I'm
going to add the left uh navigation. So,
I'm going to use a chevron left, which
is an icon to show the left uh button.
Then, I'm going to show the dots. Now,
what are the dots? Well, if you go over
here, it shows how many of the um
testimonials you have. So, it's going to
be a bunch of dots that we're going to
render, and it will depend on the
testimonials list. So, I'm going to do
testimonials map through each of them.
But, it's going to be a bit different
because we don't really care about the
individual stuff of the testimonials.
Those are rendered over here. We just
care to know how many of them there are.
So I'll just get the index over here.
And for each testimonial, I want to
render a button that is going to act as
a dot. So in this button, it's going to
be self-closing actually just like this.
And we're going to make it such that it
become it represents a dot. But before
we do that, I'm going to add this other
button that is going to be the right uh
we're going to do chevron right. And it
should be the right button. Okay. Let's
style all of this because it's looking
pretty ugly. We'll start by doing
display flex items center justify
center. So it's s center centered
vertically and centered horizontally.
We'll put a gap of four in between each
item and a margin tab top of eight. Then
on this button I'm going to add a
padding of three. I'm going to make it
completely rounded. I'm going to make it
be glass. And then I'm going to add a
hover effect where the color becomes
slightly more green when you hover it
but just a bit. Also the color will
become primary. So it becomes green. And
we're going to add a transition all. Now
this is what it looks like. I can hover
it and it becomes slightly green. I'm
going to copy this class name and I'm
going to just paste it on the chevron
right as well. Then for the dots, here's
where a lot of the styles come in. We're
going to actually have a class name that
is dynamic because if you look at how we
styled this over here, when you are in
the individual but dot that you want to
be, the style changes. Also, I don't
know if you guys noticed from the demo,
but you can click on the dots to move.
You don't have to use the left and
right, which is pretty cool. So, we'll
make this dynamic. We'll set all of them
to have a width and a height of two. And
we're going to apply a transition all
and a duration of 300. Then, I'm going
to insert here a another item where it's
going to get the index and it's going to
check to see if it's equal to zero. Now,
why am I doing zero? well, is because
for as of right now, we are only showing
the first testimonial. But then we're
going to change this to actually check
to see if it's the testimonial that we
want to currently be in. And then when
that's true, we want to check and add a
width of eight to make it bigger and a
bg primary. So you should see that it
should only have one as of right now.
That is pretty long because it's the
active one. Now, what I want to do after
is on the other ones, I want to set the
BG to be muted foreground with 30%
opacity. All of them should be gray, but
they're all together. So, we want to
separate them. And also, when you hover
them, I want to just set the same kind
of color, but it's going to be 50%
instead. Now, to separate them, we have
to add a class name on here to set
display flex. And then, we can put a gap
of two in between them. Also, I want to
make it fully rounded. So, I'm going to
add a rounded full over here so that
they actually look like what we wanted.
Now, we're kind of ready to be able to
make it dynamic. I want to be able to
click on this sections and be able to
move through them. Also, I notice as of
right now that some of our buttons don't
have the pointer, right? When I hover
it, it doesn't change my cursor to
pointer. That's actually pretty fine for
me to do. I can just come here to our
base layer, add a button layer, and make
it such that every single time we have a
cursor on a boat button, it should
become a pointer. I don't really mind
doing this for all buttons because I
think that uh all the buttons deserve to
have a cursor to be pointer. Now, what
do we want to do? Well, we want to keep
track of which testimonial we want to
show. And to do that kind of stuff, we
need to know which testimonial is in the
screen and be able to manipulate that.
So, we're going to be using states just
like we did on our navbar. Going to come
over here and I'll create a state called
active index. It's the state showing the
active index, meaning the active
testimonial. It's going to start at zero
so that it shows the first testimonial.
Then I want to make two functions. the
next it's going to be the next
testimonial function and I'm also going
to make the uh previous testimonial
function. I'm going to call this prev.
Now when I call this function all it
does is it sets the active index to be
equal to and then I'm going to get the
previous one uh oh I just realized that
I can't I shouldn't call this prev. I'll
call this previous. And then I'll get
the previous item and I'm just going to
increase it by one to move it once more.
And then here's the tricky part. I'm
going to modul it uh with a testimonials
length. Why am I doing that? Because if
I move to the last item, if you look at
the final result when I'm over here,
adding one to it is going to actually
make it be out of bounds and it's going
to the prev plus one at the last item is
going to be equal to the total length of
this. So if the list has four items,
right, the first index will be a zero,
the second one will be one, the third
one will be two, and then the last one
will be three. But the length of this is
four. Right now, if I'm in the first
item, which is how we start, and I click
the next button, it's going to call this
next function. It's going to add one to
it, and then it's going to become um
one. Then it's going to become two and
then three. When it reaches three, we
want it to go back to zero, right? What
modulate does is it gets the remainder.
So, what it's going to do is when we
have our three, it's going to add one to
it, which is going to become four. And
then it's going to modulate with the
length, which is four, which there's no
remainder. So, it's going to become
zero, which means it's going to return
back to zero. And it creates this
perfect loop. This is a very nifty
trick. And if you're not familiar with
how modular works, um, I wouldn't worry
that much. It's not a front- end topic,
like a front-end concept is more of a
programming and a math concept. So, uh,
I recommend just checking out other like
video tutorials on it. Uh, or you
definitely saw this if you did a
computer science degree or even if you
didn't, uh, just one Google search away
if you didn't fully understand my
explanation. But what we want to do now
is copy this logic, put it over here,
and do kind of the opposite. But the
opposite isn't just doing minus one
here. It's also adding the testimonials
length to the end of this minus one.
Then what we do is we go to the two
buttons, right? The chevron left over
here and the chevron right. I'm going to
put the previous here. And then on the
chevron right, I'm going to call the I'm
going to add it here actually so it's
easier. I'm going to call the next
button. And then I'm going to switch
what we show here. Instead of showing
zeros for all of them, I'm going to show
the active index. I'll copy this and
replace every single instance of where
we use the zero. It should still remain
the same, but when I click on this
button, you should see it should now
switch. Now, it's not switching this
bottom thing cuz we haven't manipulated
that yet. But we're going to do that
right now. So, what we need to do is
replace the zero with active index. You
see that now at least it shows it, but
we're not able to click on the
individual buttons. To do that, we don't
need to create an external function.
We're just going to add an on click and
call the set active index to be the
index that that specific circle is. So
now I can click on that one and it will
take me there. This one and so on. So
that's pretty much it for the
testimonial section. It's uh pretty
interesting. You can create this little
carousel and if you've never done this
before, you can now do it on every other
project that you build. Now it's time
for us to build the only fully dynamic
part of website, which is this part over
here. It's the content uh contact
section. On this section, we're going to
be using an email provider to send
emails to ourselves and we're going to
be using email.js. It's not sponsored by
email.js. I've used them multiple times
in my videos, but you can use any other
email provider if you want to. Now, to
build that, here's what we want to do.
So, what we want to do is we're going to
close that off and open up the contact
section. Now, the first thing we want to
do here in the contact section is create
an array called contact info. This one
will include certain things about how to
get in contact with you. None of these
things are true to myself. I'm obviously
not going to dox myself, but put the
information that you want. Now, some
people don't want to put like very their
phone numbers out there. I used to put
mine on my website until some of my
subscribers back in the day started
calling me and then I was like, "Oh,
it's better not to have it." Uh, but uh
I recommend you guys putting it just in
case like uh people will try to call
you, like recruiters will try to call
you. That's very common. And location,
you don't need to put your direct
address, but you can just put like the
city and the state that you live in. I
obviously don't live in San Francisco,
but I put it over here. Now, we'll start
building the section. To start things
off, I'm going to paste here the section
for the contact. Again, same thing as
what we've done so far for the other
ones, including adding a background glow
that looks like this. It's just going to
add that little glow that appears on the
section. You can just copy and paste it.
Again, just using all the stuff that we
have already used. Then I want to create
the container section. Just going to
copy and paste it as well. And inside of
the container section, I'm going to add
the header. Since we are at the section
after the testimonials where it's
centered, it should be on the left. I
think I might have not rendered the
contact section over here or I did um
but it's not rendering actually because
you see in the contact info array, we
rendered some icons, but I forgot to
import them. So we have to import them
at the top over here by just saying
import mail from Lucid React. Then
import the phone icon from Lucid as well
and the map pin icon. Now it should work
when I refresh this. Perfect. Now let's
go down here and let's see how it looks.
So this is the title section for the
contact. Now we got that stuff that we
have already worked on out of the way.
It's time to build some really
meaningful stuff. We're going to build
the contact form. We'll start by
building a div and then another div
inside of it that will have a form. Now
for the form, there's just a couple
things that we need for each uh from the
user to actually send a message to us.
We needed to have a label for the name,
the email, and also whatever they want
to send. So for each of those inputs,
we're going to have a div here with a
label representing that input. For
example, the name should have that. Then
we're going to have the actual input.
And that should be pretty much it. Then
I'll copy this, paste it here twice
more. This will be for the email. And
then this will be for the message. Now,
what do we want to do? Well, let's start
with this div over here. I'm going to
add a class name here. I'm going to make
this be glass. And I'll add a padding of
eight. You'll see that now it looks like
this. Now, I'm going to make it be
rounded 3 XL to look like a card. I'll
add a border. Make that border be
primary. 30 opacity. And I'm going to
animate fade in with a delay of 300.
Then what I want to do is on this div
over here. Actually, sorry, this class
should be on the div below. I made a
mistake in that. It should be here. And
this class should be just structuring
how this form looks. It should be a
display of grid. And in a large screen,
it should have two columns. So we're
going to do grid calls 2. Then a gap of
12. We're going to mix the width at 5xl
and a margin x of auto. Then for the
actual form, we're just going to put a
space in between each inputs because
they're all cluttered together. We'll
put a space in the y direction of six.
Then on each label, we have to pass in
an HTML 4. This is a value that is
corresponding to what we pass in here as
the ID for this input. So I'm going to
make it be name. And then on this, I'll
make it be name as well. Then on the
label, I'll make it be display block
text small font medium and margin bottom
of two. Then I'll copy this and I'll
paste it on this label and on this one
too. Now I'll change them. For the
email, I'll call this email. And for
this one, I'll call it message. And then
for the input, here's what we have to
do. We have to add a bunch of stuff
related to it. Like for example, what is
the type? I'm going to make it text. And
also the styling. We want to make it
such that the input has the full width
of the card. It has a padding x of four,
a padding y of three. And then I want to
make it have a background of surface.
Then inside of it, I'm also making it
have a rounded corner. I'm going to add
a border to it with the color border.
Border. Then I'm going to when you focus
on it, I want to add a border to make it
be green. So while I'm writing on it and
I focus, it becomes green. But there's a
problem because when I focus on it, you
see that there's this weird ring around
it that comes with every input. So I'll
actually make it such that when I focus
on it, the ring is only one size and the
color of it is primary as well. So you
see now it shouldn't look like that. But
to remove that, we just need to remove
the outline. So I'll say outline is
equal to none. And now it looks like how
exactly how I want. I'll also add a
transition all so that it's a lot
smoother. I'm going to copy this and I'm
going to paste it on the email input as
well. Now, for this one, I'm going to
paste it in here as well, but there's a
major difference for the last one
because the type that we have here for
the first one is type text. The second
one is going to be type email, but it
still looks like an input. But this last
one over here is actually not an input.
This should be a text area. And on the
text area, the only change that we need
to make is I don't want to allow it to
resize. See how it allows us to resize?
I want to remove that possibility. So
I'm going to make it be resize none. And
then when we refresh this, it should be
Yeah, I can't do that anymore. Perfect.
Now I'm going to come up here and I want
to set some requirements to our inputs.
For example, each input is going to be
required and they're going to have a
placeholder on the name. One is going to
be your name. I'm gonna copy this and
I'm gonna add it over here. This one
will be your email. And then on this
one, it's going to be just your message
just like this. Now, did we not add it
to the email? I realized I added to the
complete wrong place. It should go in
the input itself. Now, on the email one,
actually, I'm going to format it. So, it
should look like an email to let them
know. Just like this, and they should be
fine. Now, for the text area, I want to
make it a bit bigger. And we can do that
by setting the specific max amount of
rows to be five. Now we have a form
ready. But we need to have a button at
the bottom to submit the form. So below
this div, I'm going to use our button
class that we created in the beginning.
And we're going to create a button that
is going to say send message and it's
going to have a send icon as well which
we can import from Lucid React. Now we
have to import that button component.
So, I'll say import button uh from and
then I'll import at slashcomponents
slashbutton. Pretty sure that's how we
called it, right? Uh yeah. And now we
should have that button at the bottom.
Send a message. But let's make a small
change to this button just because we we
allow ourselves to customize this button
more by passing a class name. And what I
want to do is I want to set the width to
full. You see it will actually make it
entirely full width of the contact form.
I also want to make this button be of
type submit. And then I want to make the
size be large. Now, one thing you might
have noticed is that when we pass this
type submit, how will this work? Because
when we look at the component we created
here for the button, it doesn't accept a
type as a prop. But that's fine. What we
can do is situations like this, we can
just pass along every prop that we pass
here. So to do that, we can accept all
of the props by destructuring them over
here like this and then just passing
them back into the button when we call
it and then whatever I pass in as a prop
that I that isn't one of the specified
types will just be repassed down to that
button including this type. And now it's
time for us to actually make such that
this form can submit the the
information. To do that, we're going to
create a state that is going to keep
track of the form data. So we're going
to create here a use state and the form
will have the following data. It's going
to be an object with a name which is a
string, an email which is a string and a
message which is also a string. I'm
going to call this state form data and
the set form data function. Then I want
to create a function that when called is
going to submit this form. So I'll
create a handle submit function. It's
going to be async because just to send
an email it's an async operation and it
will take in the form event. If you've
ever submitted a a form in an HTML page
before, you know that it refreshes the
page. But we don't want that to happen.
We are going to prevent default, which
prevents the default behavior of
refreshing the page. Now, how do we get
uh to keep track of what the user is
typing on this form and set it to this
form data state? Well, what we do is we
go to each input and we're going to add
the following piece of code. For each
input, we want to add an onchange to it
where whenever there's a change to the
input, we're going to call the set form
data function. We keep all of it the
same. So the rest of the inputs that
aren't being touched, keep the same, but
this specific input that we are changing
here, which in this case is the name.
We're going to set that value equal to
whatever the user is typing on the
inputs. We also added a value here just
to make it such that they are both in
sync. And we do the same thing for all
of the other inputs. For the input for
the email, we do the same thing, but we
just change this to say email. And then
we change this to say email. And then on
this one, we do the exact same thing,
but we change this to say message, and
this to say message. Now, we're pretty
much ready to be able to submit this
form as a uh as an email. But to do
that, like I said, we have to set up an
account on this other external service
called Email.js. Now, this is Email.js.
Again, not sponsored. So, if you don't
want to create an account, you don't
have to do it. I'm going to log into an
account I have. I'm going to click here,
sign in. And when you create your
account, you're going to come here. It's
completely free. I want you guys to do
the following. I want you guys to click
add new service. Choose the personal
service that you have. So, to make it
free, you're only going to be receiving
emails on an account that you connect.
So, connect your own account, right? So,
your email, your Gmail, your, I don't
know, Outlook, whatever you have, and
that's the email you're going to be
receiving the contact messages from. You
choose I fetches Gmail. You click this.
You click connect account and it's going
to connect to your Gmail account. And it
allows up to 500 emails per day, I
believe, on the free plan. After that,
you're going to get a service ID. I'm
just going to use this one that I
created before creating this video. I'm
going to copy this and I'm going to come
back to our code and we need to save
that information somewhere. But we want
to save it in a environment variables
file aenv file because it's going to
make it such that we don't have we don't
have to publish this information uh to
github when we push our code. So I'm
creating here aenv
file and I'm going to create an
environment variable in this project. To
create an environment variable in vit
you have to start the name of it with
vit and then write the name of the
variable you want to create. For
example, we're going to keep track of
the service ID. So, I'm going to call it
vit emailjs
service ID and set it equal to this.
I'll do the same thing two more times
and we're going to create two more
variables. Now, we're going to create
the template ID, which I'll show you
guys how to actually make that. And
we're going to create the public key,
which I'll show you how to get that as
well. So, the public key is your public
API key. You're going to go to account
and then right over here, you see you
have access to the public key. You get
that key and then you just put it over
here. Now for the template ID, here's
what you have to do. You go to email
templates after you have already created
your service. You will see nothing. This
is what I created for the demo, but you
click on create new template. You're
going to choose contact us. Click on
create template. Then you'll have a
simple template email that you might
want to use. Now the template ID is part
of the settings over here. You're going
to copy that, come back to our code, and
paste it over here. Now before we
continue, we want to make the email look
a little bit better. Now to do that, you
can use their edit content over here.
And they have two options. Either you
write HTML to make the email look better
or you use their design editor. I hate
using design editors because I don't
know how to use it. Every website makes
it different. But HTML is universal, so
I made it in HTML. Now, if you want to
use the same one that I used, just copy
and paste. It's going to be there in the
description. Now, if you want to use the
same one, just copy. It's going to be in
the readme in the description and you
should have an email format that looks
like this. Now, this I think looks fine.
You click on apply changes and this is
the kind of email that you're going to
get. You see that there are some
variables here and they all depend on uh
what we actually send from the code that
we are sending from ourselves. Now, all
of the emails are going to be sent to
the email that you connected. I'm using
this fake email over here called Pedro
Techch Rumés. I've used it multiple
times on videos. Don't send emails to
there cuz I'm never going to look at it
and it's just the email that I use for
testing. Now I'm going to click on save
and the email template has been added
successfully. Now we can get out of
email.js and we can come back to our
code. I'm going to make it look uh in
mobile. I'm going to resize this to
mobile again. And we can come back here
to our context.jsx.
And the first thing I want to do is on
our form here I want to add an onsubmit
and call the handle submit function when
that happens. Now to send an email using
email.js JS, we have to in install the
emojis package. To do that, you're going
to run npmi email.js/browser
and then press enter. It's going to
install that package. Then you're going
to come down here to the handle submit
and we want to try sending the email and
catch any errors that might happen.
We'll start with the try case. Now,
while we send the email, we want to keep
track of some statuses of how the email
sending functionality is working. So
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
create two more states. One is going to
be an is loading and the other one is
going to be a submit status. Now what
are they? The is loading is while I send
the message when I click on this button
to send a message. While it's sending
the email I want this to show a
different like UI while it's loading,
meaning it's sending the email. And the
submit status will let us know if it was
successful or if there was an error.
We're just going to keep track of that
in case we want to show to the user
because the worst thing that can happen
is you're saying that you're good at
writing or at making websites and then a
recruiter tries to send an email to you
and you're not handling errors correctly
and then they figure out that you're not
as good of a developer. So, you want to
make sure to let them know by handling
every single state that can happen in
your website. So, right off the bat,
when we start submitting the form, I
want to reset the submit status in case
this is the second time we're sending an
email and there was an error in the
first time. And also, I'm going to set
is loading to true. Why? Because I'm
going to set is loading to true inside
of this try case over here. We're going
to try some asynchronous behavior. And
when that's done, we're going to add a
finally clause over here where I'm going
to set is loading to false. So, no
matter if it's uh an error or it was
successful, I'm going to set it to
false. Now in the strike case we want to
get the environment variables that we
created over here. To get environment
variables from uh your yourv file in vit
you basically import them say import
meta.env
and then write the name of the
environment variable. I imported all
three of them and I set them to their
respective variables. Then we want to
make sure to check to see if we got them
correctly because maybe we didn't set
it. In case we didn't, I just throw this
error. This should never go to
production. Like this should never
happen in production because in
production we're going to set our
environment variables. But we see over
here that we check it before we actually
continue. And then the next thing we
want to do is we want to send the email.
To send the email I'm going to call the
email js package. Now that I can import
over here. I'm going to import email.js
from at email.js/browser.
And what I want to do with this email.js
package is I want to call the send
function. Now the send function requires
us to pass three actually four things.
The first one is going to be the service
ID and we already have that from our
environment variables. The second one is
the template ID. So what is the template
of the email you want to send? The third
one is going to be an object with the
information that we're sending through
that email. And the final one is going
to be a public key that we have for our
account. Now what we send over here is
the actual data. So what I'm going to
put is I want to send the name, the
email, and also the message. Remember
those are all variables that we defined
in our template. If I go to our email.js
template over here, uh I think it's this
one. You'll see that it includes over
here the name, the message, and also uh
the email. Right? So what I want to do
is I want to pass in as the name the
form data.name. As the email, I'll do
the same thing but dot email. And for
the message, I'll do the same thing but
message. Then if this was successful,
I'm going to set the submit status to be
a success. And a little message just to
let the user know that everything was
correct. If it w it was also successful,
we want to reset the form data so that
the inputs are clear. Finally, in case
there's an error, I want to console log
that error so that we can see it
internally as the developers and also
set the error message to be displayed in
the screen. Now, to handle the loading
state and all of that, we're going to
come down here and for the button, the
submit button, I'm going to disable this
button if the form is currently loading.
Meaning, if I'm submitting the form, the
user can just keep sending emails and
spamming me. That's a great way to
prevent spam. Then I'm also going to
replace what we show depending on if the
user is submitting the form or not. So
hang on for a second. I'm going to check
here. If is loading is true, then I want
to render a different UI. If it's false,
I want to render what I already have.
Now, what UI do I want to render while
it's true? Well, I want to render a
message saying sending and I don't want
to show any icons. Also, let me just
make this icon a bit smaller because I
realize it's a bit big over there. I'll
make it width of five and a height of
five. Now to show the error message, I'm
just going to paste it over here because
it's a bit of the same of what we've
done so far as well. The only thing we
need to do is add the check circle and
alert circle as uh icons over here. So
we'll also add the alert circle. Now
what this is going to do is in case the
submit status is true and it's a
success. So what I'm going to do is I'm
just going to remove this check so you
guys can see what happens in case it's
true. Then we see a and then I'll make
this be success. So what happens is if
this is success and this is success. I
know this looks really weird. We see a
success message over here. If it's not
if it's an error, we're going to see it
red and we're going to see this look
like an error message and it only shows
if the submit status gets updated. Now
it's time for us to try sending a
message. I'm going to open up my email
and we'll see if we do receive it. If we
don't, I'll address any errors. Okay, I
have the email opened over there and I'm
going to also inspect element over here
so we can see if we console log
anything. I'm going to send an email.
I'm going to pretend I'm a recruiter
called jack raider from jack
atraider.com
and say hello, we are interested in
hiring you. Going to click send message.
It changes to that state and then it
says message sent successfully. So it
seems like everything was great. The
only way to check is if I actually got
that email. And guess what? I did get
that email. I got that email and it was
sent from another account that I
registered, not my uh not this account
specifically, but it looks fine. It
looks great. I actually got the correct
information from what we said and the
actual message. So, the email contact
form is working perfectly. Now, you
might be noticing that this is a bit out
of place, and that's because I also
added this part over here that talks
about uh your actual contact
information, and that's why we even put
this uh list at the top. Now, to do
that, it's pretty simple. I It's a lot
of what we've done so far. So, I'm also
going to just copy and paste it. If you
don't like that I'm copy and pasting
this end of the video, you can criticize
me in the description, but I feel like
it's better to just go a bit faster
because I already spent a lot of time
explaining the rest of this to you guys.
Now, below this deal over here, we're
adding the contact info. Now, for the
contact info, I'm going to paste the
following. This is how it's going to
look. You're going to render a title for
the section. You're going to loop
through the contact info list that we
created, and you're just going to render
a little tag for each of them. Now, this
is how it's going to look. You map
through each of them. render it, show
the icon, show the label, and at the
bottom, we just added a very simple
availability card that blinks by using
the enemy pulse that we have used as
well previously in this tutorial. And
that's pretty much it. Now, the final
thing that I want to do is I want to add
a footer at the bottom. Now, for the
footer, I'm going to create here a
component, and it's going to be in the
layout. It's going to be called
footer.jsx.
Then if you want to have my footer, just
copy and paste this code and it's going
to just be a representation of the nfbar
at the bottom with the current year and
all the social links that we have. It
should look a bit like oh actually I
didn't call it. So we'll come here to
our app.jsx and I'm going to call it
right below the main tag and I'll call
the footer. And it should look like
this. So feel free to use the same kind
of footer if you want to. It's basically
a re redone of the navbar. And that's
pretty much it. Now, we just have to
deploy this website so that everyone can
access it no matter where they are. Now,
it's time for us to deploy our
application so that our recruiters can
see our website being live. Now, to do
that, we're going to be using two free
services, GitHub and Verscell. GitHub is
going to store our code and Verscell is
going to host it. Now, in order for us
to get this to work, we need to first
push our code to a GitHub repository.
So, I'm going to create a new
repository. I'm going to call it React
Tailwind personal portfolio. And I'll
create this repository. This is going to
be the repository that you guys see when
you um access my code. Then we have an
issue because you know this file, this
is not a file that we want to push to
the public. Why? Because it has all of
our uh API keys for email.js and we
don't want it to be available for
everyone browsing our GitHub account. So
what I want to do is I want to just
simply make this file be a local file by
adding av.local.
This on top of also coming here and
maybe making all env variations
likev.local
anything it will make it such that in
our whenever we push this code to GitHub
it's going to ignore um the env file
that we have here. Then I want to push
this code. So to push it, I'm going to
copy all of this command and I'm going
to initialize a new repository in our
project. You see that thev.local is kind
of hidden. It's gray and that's because
it is not going to be sent when we push
this code. Then I'm going to run git at
dot and I'm going to paste all of the
commands that we copied from there. This
should paste and push all of our code.
And if we look right here, you see that
we have our entire code, but it doesn't
include thev.local file. Now we can go
ahead and create a Verscell account. I
highly recommend that you create an
account with GitHub by using your GitHub
account so that both of them are already
connected. Now when you get to Verscell,
you're going to come here to projects
and then overview and click on add new
project. Then what I need you to do is
you need to find the repository that we
just created. We created here the React
Tailwind personal portfolio and that's
the one that I want to choose. I'm going
to click on import and you see it
automatically detects that this is a VIT
project. Now the important part is that
we need to set on our environment
variables. That's why we remove the
environment variables from in push for
GitHub because we're going to actually
add them in the back end here while
deploying it to Verscell. We're going to
copy this entire list. You can just copy
like this and paste it here and Verscell
will recognize what they are. Then we're
going to click deploy and it's going to
start deploying the app. Now if there's
any issues while it's building, I'll let
you guys know and I'll show you guys how
to fix it. Once in a while I do see
failures like it's saying here failed to
load data. We'll see what this is.
However, uh if everything is fine like
it seems like it was a website should be
deployed. Now where is it deployed?
Well, it's deployed to this public URL
that is the name of our repository on
GitHub and then doverell.app. You can
access this website if you want to by
just clicking the link in the
description. Now we have our website
fully working and if you want to change
the URL, maybe put your own domain, you
do all of that in Verscell. The great
thing about Versel as well is you can
check a bunch of stuff here like
analytics and so on. But this video is
not sponsored by Versel. I'm not going
to go into high high details on what you
can do there just because also uh most
of them are in the paid plan. So this is
basically it. If you enjoyed the video,
