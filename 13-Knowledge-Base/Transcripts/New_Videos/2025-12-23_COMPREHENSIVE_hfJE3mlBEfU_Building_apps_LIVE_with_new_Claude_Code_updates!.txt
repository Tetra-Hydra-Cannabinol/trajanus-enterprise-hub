Today we are going to build out a full
startup live on stream using Claude Code
and all the new features they just
launched. They released a ton. We'll go
over the new features real quick. And
then we are going to go over building
and launching the Vibecoded app store.
We are so close to launching this. So
buckle in, get in the chat, get in the
replies, say hello to everyone watching
this live stream. We're going to do so
many cool things on here. You're going
to love it. You're gonna enjoy it. I
can't wait to get into it with you.
There's been so many changes to Claude
Code over the last few weeks. For those
who've been missing out, they've been
doing the advent of uh Claude Code on X.
They've been doing the advent of Claude
Code on X and they've had so many
changes. Let's go into those changes. I
want to go into those changes that
they've done. We will start off there.
then we will get into the uh building of
the app. Let me pull open these changes.
Here we go.
Let me share my screen. Hope everyone
had a great weekend. I did not sleep a
wink last night. I am running on zero
hours of sleep. Zero hours of sleep. Uh
this is truly after being sick all last
week and then doing this live stream
with zero sleep. It is a truly
impressive performance from me. All
right, let's see what we got here. Wasim
2K with the first to like. Thank you,
Wasim. Leave the likes down below. Let's
blow this party up. We had a huge video
this morning. So I created a video this
morning. We'll get into the building of
the app. We'll get into Claude code in
just a second. Patience, my friends.
We're going to get into the changes to
Claude Code first. Uh there have been
massive massive change. I think they've
had like 20 different updates and
changes over the last uh few weeks. I
picked out my top 10
changes which I'll go over here. I put
them on my last video which is blowing
up. My last video is blowing up. I
posted it this morning. If you haven't
checked out my latest Claude Code video,
make sure to do that right after this.
Uh it is blowing up right now though.
You guys want to see the numbers? We're
way above average on the Claude Code
video we posted this morning. Way above
average. 6.2,000 in the first four
hours. Not bad. It goes over my top 10
changes of Claude Code over the last few
weeks. Uh bunch of changes. Some of
these are older, some of these are
newer, but these are all some sort of
recent changes they've announced. No
sleep. You'll hallucinate with Claude
and I'm here for it. Yeah, this might be
a uh a drunk uh live coding session. a
drunk as in no sleep live coding
session. Resume old sessions. When you
go in a project and run this command,
you'll see all your old Claude. So now
you can resume old sessions, right? You
open up Claude, you reset your computer,
and it lost all its contacts from your
previous session. Now you can do dash
resume claud-res
and it will resume your last session or
any of your older sessions you choose,
which is pretty sick.
I hope your health is fine now. I am
healthy. I think I don't feel sick
anymore. I just have a crazy cough. I
have a lingering cough. I don't know. Is
this CO? Do I have COVID? Was this
entire video just flagged because I said
the word COVID? I don't know. I don't
know. But that is where I am at
currently. Happy Monday, brother.
Cheers. Shout out. You got any grapes?
Representing the Twitch community.
Twitch community is growing. Don't sleep
on the Twitch community. I don't
advertise it at all. It seems to be
growing organically. That's great. Glad
you are alive, my friend. Well, I'm not
close to death, but
uh tough tough week of sleep when you're
really sick. Claude Code is cooking
crazy good. Yeah, I don't get the people
on X saying uh it's nerfed. So many
people on X saying Claude Code's nerfed.
I'm building out some crazy stuff with
Claude Code recently. Some crazy stuff.
And it's performing great for me. I
don't know. What are people complaining
about? Is it? Do you guys feel like
Claude Code's gotten stupider? Let me
know in the replies. If you're watching
the replay, let me know in the replies.
Do you feel like Claude Code's gotten
stupider? If you're watching it live,
let me know in the chat. Do you feel
like Claude codes got gone ster? I
haven't felt it getting stupider. It
feels totally normal to me. I have been
building some incredible things right
now that it it's continuously blown me
away since it's launched. It's
continuously blown me away since Opus 45
launched. Ever since Opus 45 dropped,
I've been nothing but blown away. I
really think it's the greatest
technology I've ever used in my entire
life and by by far. Claude is 4.5 inside
claude code is the greatest technology
I've ever used in my life. By far
and it's done nothing but get better for
me. So I don't understand the people
saying it's getting stupider. I feel
like compaction is very aggressive now.
Are you see uh I am seeing that I am
seeing compaction is getting more
aggressive where it seems to be
compacting a lot more. I'm going to be
honest. I don't do the best context
management. And what I mean by that is
I'm not clearing a ton. I'm not opening
up separate sessions for a bunch of like
for very delineated tasks. So I could do
a better job of uh I think context
management myself
as some nerds call it context
engineering or something. Bologoney. Uh
but it does appear that compaction is
getting more aggressive, but I haven't
seen like
a downturn in uh performance because of
it. It compacts more. I have to sit
there for a couple extra seconds every
once in a while because it's compacting
more. Uh but I I I don't I haven't seen
like a downturn in performance
cuz there aren't people on X just bots.
Uh correct. [laughter]
There's there's I mean there's humans
there's humans on X but they're bot
humans. It it seems like it seems like
half the people in X are bots. The other
half are people that are just bots. Like
as in like they just repeat stuff and
don't think for themselves. They don't
think independently.
Nope. Working great. Using it right now
in the background. Quite the opposite.
That's what I'm talking about ASAP,
Carl. That's how I think people should
be using this live stream. Use it as a
vibe coding session, right? You can hang
out with me and see what I'm doing and
learn stuff and I teach you stuff and no
one teaches it better on YouTube. We
have the number one vibe coding channel
on YouTube by far. Number one vibe
coding channel on YouTube by far. But
you can also use this just as kind of
background noise to vibe code
here
out
built your own things in claude code.
Use this as inspiration. Say hello to
the chat. Share your idea in the chat.
They go, "Wow, that's amazing idea. I
love that. I want to be your first
customer or I want to be your
co-founder." That'd be the dream of how
this live stream works. So, I'm I'm ASAP
Carl. Love it. Love it that you're uh
vibing while I vibe. No, I think it's
the opposite. It's getting smarter. Heck
was optimizing 3D mods for me last
night. Who knew? Kyle Travis KC, what
are you doing
for 3D models? What are you What are you
building? I'm I'm curious because I want
to build a game. I have like 10
different projects I'm working on. Uh,
one of the ones I want to build is a 3D
game. A top-own 3D game,
top down 3D shooting game. I have like a
genius idea for uh, right now I'm doing
Claude Code connected to Unity where I
have it connected to a Unity project,
but it's very it's kind of tedious. It
automates a good amount of it for me,
but a lot of the model stuff is not
automated. So, I'm curious, what are you
doing with Claude Code and 3D models?
Tell me what you're doing if you don't
mind. I'm curious.
Someone tweeted yesterday about a
claude code uh Unreal Engine MCP server
and I'm going to experiment with that
today. As you can see, I have the tab up
here for an Unreal Engine MCP server. Uh
I'm said that you can uh use Cloud Code
to build 3D models, which would automate
a lot of this process for me. So, I'm
curious what you're doing.
I had to delete my memory steering and
start fresh. I think my old markdowns
from when I tried to fix old problems
and making it do crazy things.
Yeah, you have to you have to update
your markdowns and your claw rules
often. As Claude evolves and changes,
you got to update your rules with them
because it starts doing some things
better, some things worse. So, that's a
good call. It's a good call you got any
grapes. Definitely not nerfed. I've been
using to orchestrate Gemini 3 flash
agent has it's been amazing. Gemini
Flash is an incredible value. See, this
is what's up. Finnfam is smart. FinFam
is next level. If you're watching this
live stream right now, you're next level
thinker. You're next level, right?
You're not one of these bots on X
saying, "Oh, Claude Code's degraded.
Claude Code's degraded." That's a skill
issue. If Claude code is degraded for
you, that's a skill issue. Us in the
Finnf Fam, people watch this live
stream, we don't have skill issues,
right? If you watch this live stream,
you're going to be a master of Claude
code. You're going to be next level.
You're not going to see performance
degradations. Okay. Same. I've never
noticed any degra. Yeah, we're 100% not
noticing any degradation here. It's been
working fine for me. I'm convinced
people are just hating on it for
engagement. There's I think there's
multiple reasons people hate on Claude
Code on [music] X. One, cuz they're
idiots. They just don't know how to use
Claude Code. That's reason number one.
Two, engagement. So, they're just rage
baiting for engagement. And three, and
this one's a lot more pertinent than you
can imagine. Pertinent. Great
vocabulary, this guy.
A lot of people are getting paid by AI
companies. And not disclo, we talked
about this last week, but I think a lot
of people, I'm not even joking,
are being paid to hate on Claude Code.
I'm not joking. I think there are a lot
of people getting paid by other AI
companies, other vibe coding tools to
hate on Claude Code.
There is so much money in this game that
you can't imagine. The corruption from a
lot of content creators is sickening.
There's a lot of corruption in the
content creation game for AI where they
don't disclose sponsorships. They don't
disclose they're getting paid. They're
getting paid to hate on tools. They're
getting paid to crap on tools. They're
getting paid to promote tools and they
don't disclose it. They don't disclose
it. That's illegal. That's illegal.
That's a crime in a lot of content
creators on X on YouTube. Uh
I mean, I'd call it selling out, but
it's not even selling out. It's just
crime. It's crime. If you don't
disclose, you're getting paid. It's a
crime.
I watch your claw. New commands. I
implemented those commands my project
today. Context. Yeah. Slashcontext is
great. The memories, the hashtagmemories
one is great, especially for the design
skill. I I find Claude Code doesn't use
the design skill enough. The design
skill is incredible. It's an
unbelievable skill. Uh, use the design
skill and having it put in memory to use
the design skill anytime it changes the
UI has been helpful.
It compacts when you use up your
context. Not much room for it to get
more aggressive. No. Um,
I just have noticed that it compacts way
more often. I just have noticed that.
So, I don't know if it's becoming less
efficient with context. If I'm doing
things wrong, it's a skill issue on my
part where I'm using context up quicker.
I'm not complaining. It hasn't nothing's
degraded. Just something I've noticed.
What percent of the time do you spend on
optimizing improving your cloud code
workflows versus building your projects?
I'm going to be honest, 95% building, 5%
optimizing. Um, I try my best to spend
time on the optimizing, improving,
studying side of that. I buy I have
machine learning books out the wall.
Like I this is not just for claude code.
This is for everything AI. Like I think
it's important to study AI and
understand on a deep level how it works
and like do the studying part, but I'm
going to be honest, I find the building
part significantly more fun.
I just enjoy building a lot more than I
do optimizing. And I think a side effect
of building is you actually organically
learn how to optimize as you go. And so,
um, I'd say 95, if not 99% building and
then 1% to 5% optimizing. And then I
learn how to optimize as I go. And I
just carve out some time to spend
healthy uh amounts of time during the
day consuming content around AI, whether
that's podcast, blog post, tweets. And
when I say healthy, what I mean by that
is not doom scrolling, not reading rage
bait, not reading stuff that's trying to
destroy your brain, not reading
undisclosed shills. Um, I have a very
curated content feed when it comes to AI
as well that helps me optimize, but most
of my time is spent building. I just
love building.
I don't think you're going to become a
billionaire off studying and optimizing.
I think you become a billionaire off
building and creating things and putting
it out in the world. [music] So that is
what I'm doing. I've seen a downturn.
Feels like cursor Q2 than Claude. Uh
feel keeps taking the simple comment out
rather than fix. So I know what you're
talking about when it comes to cursor
Q2, right? It seems right when Claude
code came out, cursor went to [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] for
me. Try not to curse as much. Uh right
when we were transitioning from like
Sonnet 35 to Sonnet 37, right when
Claude Code dropped for me, cursor was
basically unusable. I was like literally
punching holes in my desk. I was so
upset at it because it would go in bug
holes and error holes and loops and
[music] it would it wouldn't be able to
fix things.
And then clawed code comes out [music]
and it blew my mind and it was way
better. I never went back to cursor
since then. But I I I mean I think
Claude Code has had downturns. I think
like June of this year Claude Code had a
downturn. maybe went like halfway
through 37 where it just became like
super frustrating and unusable and I was
going on like Reddit boards. I hate
Reddit, but I was going on Reddit boards
like what the hell's going on? Uh, but
since Opus 45, I'm going to be honest,
I haven't had a single downturn. Opus 45
has been I don't want to call it
flawless, but I kind of want to call it
flawless. It's been kind of flawless for
me. Tell us about our product marketing
strategy after vibe coding our MVP
product. Create content.
I mean, you have two there's two paths.
If you want to get customers, there's
two paths, right?
Paid and unpaid advertising. So, you can
do paid advertising where you pay for
ads on Instagram, YouTube, Tik Tok,
whatever. And then you have unpaid
advertising which is organic,
which is free.
creating content, doing what I'm doing
literally right now as you watch me. I'm
live streaming. I'm building a
community. I don't have anything to sell
you right now other than maybe Vibe
Coding Academy, my uh community where I
have the courses and weekly calls and
stuff like that and hackathons,
right? But like when I build and ship
products, I've already shipped creator.
When I ship my next product, I'm just
going to come on this live stream and
tell you about it and probably get a few
customers for it. So, there's the unpaid
side, which is content. I'm gonna be
honest with you, I strongly prefer the
unpaid side because when you do the
unpaid side, you're doing more than just
selling products. You're building
community. You're building you're
building so much, right? It's so high
leverage. Building an organic community
through content is so high leverage,
it'll blow your mind, right? Let's look
at my earnings on YouTube.
Like, I'm not only building a
distribution channel where I can sell my
products. I can sell my community, where
I can sell my educational content,
right? It's also earning its own money
on top of that,
right? We have $4,600 in the last month
off YouTube ads.
Boom. So, not only am I selling products
through my distribution, not only am I
building community, not only I getting
more eyes and building, [music] you
know, a huge advertising channel, but
it's also making money itself.
So, even if I didn't sell a damn thing,
I'd be making a living off this, right?
So, that's pretty amazing. And this is
just YouTube. There's also X, which
makes I think like $2,400 a month in
advertising. Then there's like the
subscriptions on there and and all that.
So, even if I didn't sell a damn thing,
it'd be good. So, tell us about our
product marketing strategy after Vibe
coding our MVP. I think building a
content channel is as good as it
possibly can get. If you want to go the
best route, I think uh YouTube's the
best content distribution route. If you
want to go the easiest route, I think X
is the easiest route because all you got
to do is write tweets. Takes like a
minute to write a tweet and you press
send and you get views and engagement
and clicks and likes. So you want the
hard route, which is the best YouTube.
If you want the easiest route, which is
the best to start, X.
If you like to dance and shake your ass,
I don't know, maybe do Tik Tok. If you
like to put on bikinis, I don't know, go
on Instagram. It's up to you. But that's
what uh the product marketing strategy
would be. We'll get to vibe coding in a
second here. We're just w We're just
warming up the crowd. You know what I'm
saying? We're warming up the crowd.
We're answering questions. We're talking
Claude. We're talking vibe code. We're
talking bikinis.
More updates to Claude Code recently.
See what takes up your context. Running
this command shows you what takes up
your context window. Great to use when
Claude is hallucinating a lot or not
cooperating. Slashcontext. Run
slashcontext and claude code and you'll
see what's taking up your context. If
you're using Claude code right now while
you're watching this live stream, why
don't you just type in slashcontext
right now. See what's going on.
Did you just call us the FinnFam? Says
relax sleep2712. Relax and sleep 27.
Yes, I did. That's the name of the
community is the FinnFam [music]
community. If you're watching this,
you're part of the Finn fam. If you
don't want to be part of the Finn fam,
you can see your way out. Relax and
sleep. You can go relax and sleep. If
you don't want to be a part of the Finn
fam,
yeah, I think when people get to a
certain point and they need more skill
to get to the last mile and they don't
know what to do, need to implement some
skills, clean up memory. Yep.
Non-Claude bots. I don't understand. If
someone's hating on Claude Code,
they are either really stupid
or
a paid actor. That's it. There Claude
Code is so obviously the best product in
this space. It's so obvious. And I'm not
getting paid by Anthropic. Anthropic
doesn't even talk to me. There's no one.
The only AI company that actively
reaches out to me is Google.
And I spend very little time shilling
Google on this channel,
right? So I'm unbiased.
Anthropic does not reach out to me. Open
AAI does not reach out to me. Google's
the only company that reaches out to me,
which is very nice of them. Shout out
Google. Shout out that multi- trillion
dollar Goliath Google because they reach
out to me. Anthropic does not. And I'm
going to say it right now. Anthropic is
so clearly the best product in the
[music] space. Claude Coat. It's so
obvious.
Would I still like it if Anthropic
reached out said, "Hey, shout out to
you, Alex. Shout out you for doing
nothing but pumping our bags 24/7."
I would hate it.
I wouldn't hate it.
Uh, it's still great, but this certainly
does seem to happen a lot more. But I
guess it's not a big deal. Will there be
some coding or just spitting hate? Says
Carol Song. All right, dude. Chill.
Let's code. Chill.
Chill. Let's code. Huh?
Let me pull open the Vibe Code app store
we're building. Eh,
where is it at? I'm pulling it open.
Everyone relax. Everyone relax.
Here we go.
What are we working on? The the the
Carol song of the world ask. What are
you working on? Uh we're working on a
vibecoded app store and a store where
any you guys any of you guys watching
here can go in submit your own apps that
you're building. We had a question five
minutes ago where guys said, "Hey, what
happens when I MVP build my own app? How
do I get customers?" Vibecoded app
store. You'll be able to do it. You'll
be able to submit your app here and get
your first customers. We only have a few
more details we're going to add here.
We're adding We're going to change a few
more things
and then we're going to launch it and
you guys can submit your apps. It's also
a social network in a way. There's a
community section where you can add, you
know, what are you doing in Claude Code?
What are you doing here? You can you can
talk to each other, chat. Side note,
anything you want to see in here, let me
know. Put in the chat. I'll add it.
We'll build it out right now. We'll make
this interactive. You anything you want
in the vibe coded app store or community
section, let me know. I'll put it in.
I love your CE CEO co-pilot flow. Do you
have your own set of instructions for it
or just ask Claude on demand? Well, so I
use chat GBT 52 as the co-pilot
and I use a project in chat GPT. Uh I
use a project that has like a bunch of
documents I created that has information
about, you know, my many lines of
business, my content, all that. Uh so I
would recommend doing that. If you
prefer Claude for chatting, I prefer
chat GBT for chatting. But if you prefer
Claude for chatting, uh you can use
Claude, start a project there. But I
would start a project in your chatbot of
choice. Add a bunch of documents on what
you're building, what content you write,
your lines of business, whatever it is.
And then start a chat in that project
and say, "Hey, you're my co-pilot CEO
for this project I'm building. I'm going
to ask you questions. You ready?" Uh and
that's how you use that chat. I like
Chad GBT because their memories are the
best in the industry. It remembers the
most stuff about me. It remembers
conversations from months ago. I love
the memory uh features.
Um but you can use whatever you want for
the CEO.
You should search about autoclaw. Crazy
good. What the hell's autoclaw? Auto
claude.
Auto claude.
Auto claude. It's an autorecker in
France.
What? Maybe not them. Uh, autonomous
multi session AI.
Who's this guy? Andy. Andy Mick.
Andre Mickelson.
Well, he's doing a good job of
promoting. You search AutoCloud, all you
see is his face and then you go to the
GitHub for AutoCloud and it's by him.
So, he's doing a good job promoting his
product at least. [music] Uh, is this
guy who did the No, Sergio Santos 3840,
but might be Andre Mick.
Uh, what's AutoClaude? AutoClaude, your
AI coding companion. Build features, fix
bugs, ship faster with autonomous agents
that plan, code, and validate for you.
It's a desktop app that supercharges
your AI coding workflow. Whether you're
a vibe code or just getting started,
autonomous task describe what you want
to build and agents handle. Planning,
coding, validation. Agent terminals. Run
cloud code up to 12 terminal. They clean
layout. Smart naming based on context
and oneclick task injection. Safe by
default. So what is this? Just a canband
board that's connected to cloud code.
Can't you use linear MCP to do the same
thing or am I confused? I guess this has
terminals built in. So if you want an
integrated terminal, I guess this is an
advantage.
Uh I had an idea about building a
project management tool for vibe coders
that was something like this where it's
connected to your cloud code. Oh, on the
small screen here that where you where
it's like a canband board connected to
quad code and you just move cards over
and it kind of runs it and does it for
you.
I'm going to be honest. Um,
my thought process when it comes to
adding more tools to my tool stack,
whether it's tools like this, MCP,
skills, anything.
I'm kind of like Elon Musk when it comes
to like hiring.
Elon Musk's process for hiring is a lot
uh is very similar to my process for
adding tools like this, which is I like
am ruthlessly efficient. I just don't
add things for the sake of adding
things. Like it's like, okay, if I'm
going to hire you as a tool, I'm going
to hire you as an MCP. Like, you better
improve my workflow so outrageously
much. It's worth the complexity of
adding you on. I'm going to be honest. I
don't know if a cananband board that
just automated that's just automate
itself uh adds the efficiency I'm
looking for.
Like I don't think this so dramatically
changes how I work that it's like okay I
need to add this and make my workflow
more complex by adding it. You know for
me I open up a terminal and I talk to
claude code
right that is my workflow. What's your
workflow Alex for claude code? My
workflow for claude code if you want to
know is um
it's this I'll show you I'll show you my
entire workflow in one screen. [music]
Here's my entire workflow. Uh it's I
open up claude code in the terminal and
then I talk to it. Right? Any complexity
that want that's going to be added on
top of that it needs to so dramatically
improve what I'm doing that it's worth
it. For me, the design skill, the claude
code design skill is worth the added
complexity cuz it makes my UI so much
better that it's worth it for me to type
in, hey, make sure to use the design
skill. I'm adding complexity by saying,
"Hey, use the design skill." And to me,
it's worth that added complexity because
the designs are so nice. Am I going to
open up a canban board and like update
cards
so that like it automatically goes
through the cards? I don't know. I think
I like the workflow of me talking to
Claude Code better. I think I like the
workflow of going in here and talking to
Claude Code and saying build this for me
a lot more. I enjoy that. I enjoy
telling Claude Code to do things and
then it does those things and I watch it
do those things. I enjoy that. I don't
know if I need it to be 100% automated.
Speaking of that though, how many views
this guy getting on his videos?
Auto clawed 28,000 views in the last
five days.
Shout out Andre Mickelson.
Got a good camera. He's looking good. I
like the lighting. I like the studio
setup here. He's looking good. Kind of
like that.
He's looking good. He's getting views.
People are liking this. 28,000 views in
5 days for the AI AI coding on steroids.
That's a good That's a good title.
That's a good title. That's good. That's
good. That's good. Tasteful. That's
tasteful clickbait. AI coding on
steroids. I got to I'm going to steal
that. Andre, if you're watching, I'm
stealing that. I don't know how I'm
stealing it. I got to think of a
subject. I'm gonna think of a subject
that fits into AI coding on steroids.
I'm going to take it. Uh what's his uh
thumbnails look like.
They're all right. They could be better.
They could be better. Thumbnails aren't
great. Thumbnails aren't great. They
could be better. Yeah. It's why he had
that banger 28K, but only 110 views. 100
views. 136 views. Got to work on the
thumbnails. Andre, this is how you start
to operate when you become a content
creator. here. This is how you see
things. This is how you see things.
Cursor AI tutorial vibe coding for
beginners. Not a good title. Stream
highlights. No one's going to click 68
views. It's not surprising you only 68
views. All right,
it's your content review. If more of you
guys start making content, I'll start
doing more of those, but I have a
feeling not many of you are huge content
creators. So, let's go back to building.
Huh.
Have you done any iOS apps? I've been
using Kur to help me then with Swift.
Yeah, it's great. I I haven't launched
any iOS apps, but using cursor cla code
to build iOS apps is fantastic. I got a
couple videos on it.
Books, where we're going with ML, we
don't need books. Well, funny thing is
I'm reading books about ML.
Have you seen the anti- vibe coding
folks recently? Yeah, me neither. There
are anti- vibe coding people, but
they're just like idiots. Alex, can you
do full walkthrough on Claude Skills
agents? I'm seeing some exciting stuff
in the space. I can't fully wrap my mind
about. I'm getting a lot of asked
recently on on videos for Claude skills.
Do you guys want to see more videos on
Claude skills?
I was planning a video. This might be my
next one. I was planning a video on like
eight Claude skills you need to
implement and how to use them. Is that
what you're looking for from a Claude
skills video or do you want more highle
this is why claude skills are so
powerful? What are you looking for from
a Claude skills video? Let me know. They
are tracking the issue in the current
version clock but the people claiming
it's an Opus 45 nerf just don't
understand the difference between the
coding agent rap. Yeah, I agree with you
SNBart. I think I think if you've seen
any degradations from changes they're
doing to the harness. I don't think it's
from the model.
How are you solving for verification
validation task in claude code? How are
you solving for verification and
validation task in claude code? How do
you automate with very high accuracy? is
hour 20s.
When you say val verification,
validation like do you mean like
verifying it completed the task? Are you
just testing? Like are you asking me how
do I verify the work it did? What's good
hour 20s?
Um I mean this is a big reason why I
don't use like the tools we just talked
about like that auto cloud or whatever
is I like to work handinhand with claude
code, right? where I give it a task to
do, it completes it, and then I go and I
open it up and I test it in and out
completely myself. Make sure the data is
flowing to the database. Make sure it's
using good security,
you know, all of that. Is that what you
mean by validation, verification? I know
there's some MCPs out there like
Playright where it'll auto control your
browser and test it for you. I know
anthropic building that into cloud code
now with claude for Chrome.
I don't love where it's at at the
moment, you know? I I just don't trust
the MCPS that control your browser and
test things for you. I like if I'm going
to sit there and watch a robot click
around and not know what it's doing, I'd
rather just do it myself. So, I just I
just test vigorously myself. Am I
putting like the best unit test in my
code? No. Should I? Maybe.
I'm all about speed, baby. It's all
about that speed. Ironically, I love the
fact that your videos are not just
reading off a script that AI created.
Most channels, you might as well just
read the transcripts. Not engaging at
all. Uh I mean, I don't know if you're
talking about specifically my videos or
like uh these live streams
when it comes to like I watch every AI
channel on YouTube. I watch every single
AI channel on YouTube.
And I think that you you have kind of
one of two people and I don't this is
not me talking crap on like content
creators or other content creators. I
respect the hustle. It's not worth
starting drama, but it's like I feel
like most people that create AI content,
they're either more on the tech side or
more on the showman side.
And both are necessary. A lot of people
on the showman side, they're not super
deep. They're not balls deep into the
tech and building it out [music] and and
you know, so they go more highlighted.
They pull up when a new product comes
out, they pull up the blog post and they
just the whole video is them just going
down reading the blog post, right? And
then there's more the technical people
are actually balls deep into the
technology and then it's more of them,
the video is them just kind of clicking
around, clicking around, right?
I try to find that sweet milky center. I
try to find that sweet milky center
where you get some of the showmanship
where I make it exciting and interesting
and entertaining to consume the content,
but at the same time I'm giving you
practical advice. I'm telling you
practically how to use it because I'm in
it all day. Every day I'm in this stuff
12 hours a day. I'm flawed coding out
the law, too. I'm building stuff. I have
10 projects going at once. I'm building
a extraction shooter video game. I'm
maintaining my $300,000 a year SAS
creator buddy. I'm building out 10 other
things. I'm building AGI. So that's what
I like to I like to keep it I like to
find that sweet bullseye center of
entertaining, interesting, educational,
but efficient.
You know what I'm saying? All right,
where we at? Uh, give me a rundown. All
right, wait. Let's see where the last
chat was with this Vibe Code app store.
Um, okay. So, for the app screenshots.
Okay, so we completed the app
screenshots
for the listings pages for every app.
How many of you guys are submitting
something when I launch this app store?
By the way, it's going to be free, free,
free, free, for free. How many of you
guys are submitting your vibe coded apps
to the app store? I'm curious.
All right, give me a rundown of where we
are at. And please put it in a new
project rundown markdown file. So, some
every once in a while, I like to do this
when I'm building
because I do like 20 projects at once.
If I'm somewhere where I'm resuming a
super complex project like this, I'll
just say, "Hey, give me a rundown where
we're at,
make a new run a markdown file that has
a full project rundown everywhere we're
at the Tekken and everything so that
when we go back, we can use that
markdown file as context."
You building AGI? Yes, I am. I'm
building AGI. I'm building AGI.
That might sound crazy.
That might sound crazy. Uh, but I'm
doing it.
I don't think AGI is when a
AI model is
smart enough.
Like I don't think AGI is like,
oh, this model is so smart we're at AGI,
right? Like I don't think it's a
scaling issue where we just got to get
the models a little smarter, a little
smarter, a little smarter. I actually
think the AGI is going to come in the
harness
where
it's a system
built that uses the intelligence in the
right way.
I think a like and obviously AGI has
many different definitions. I don't
think there's one agreed upon
definition. Most people say, "Oh, it's
when AI is just as good as human beings
at everything or just as smart or
intelligent as human beings as
everything." I think we're already
there. Now,
what what is Chad GBT 5.2 or Gemini 3 or
Claude Opus 45 weaker at human beings
then?
Can you name anything? I think it's just
as good intellectually. So then why
aren't why aren't we considered AGI?
Well, I would say it's probably because
in order to experience that
intelligence,
you need to go into a chatbot and ask
the chatbot questions, right?
I don't think that's is is like is AGI a
chatbot? I don't think an AGI is a
chatbot. I think it's the experience
with the AI that's going to do the AGI.
You know what I'm saying? as in like
right now AI is reactive through a
chatbot. In order to experience
intelligence, I need to go into a
chatbot and ask a question and then it
gives me intelligence back.
AGI will never be that. There'll never
be like, oh, the model is so smart now
we're at AGI because I can ask questions
and it answers the questions really
well. And I hope you're following along
with me here. I think AGI in my opinion,
and who the hell am I? I'm some guy on
YouTube. Um,
AGI in my opinion will be when the AI,
the very intelligent AI, which I think
we're already there when it comes to
intelligence,
do knows you, does things for you
proactively and gets work done for you
and creates economic value for you
without you having to do any creative
thinking whatsoever.
You catching my drift? AGI in my opinion
will be when you can,
this is the entire AI experience. Follow
along with me here. You hit a button,
click,
and now you are experiencing economic
value in perpetuity.
from that point forward.
That's AGI in my opinion and that's what
I'm building or that's what I'm working
on right now. That's what I want to
build
is an AI experience where you hit a
button click and then for years after
that an AI is going to work without any
input from you necessary doing work
creating economic value for you
improving your life making your life
better.
If you can hit a button to do that, then
that button won't exist. That's insanely
dumb. Says the smash cash. Smash the
cash.
Well, I'd call you insanely dumb, but
then I'd feel like I'd be punching down,
so I'm not going to say that.
And shout out ALD. I see you, bro. I
don't know who ALD is, but shout out
ALD. Have you tried using Automaker yet?
Uh, I don't know what automaker is.
Yes, nothing high level. I want
practical examples of claude skills and
agents working together. Your videos are
clear. Most others are too technical.
Let's go. A Finn, I will pay. Well, Ben
Yamam525, the good news is my YouTube's
free, so you won't have to pay unless
you want to join the Vibe Coding Academy
link down below. You get a full Claude
code master class which does have a
Claude skills section. And you also get
weekly calls with me. So you can go on
the call and ask me questions or uh
call me dumb, whatever you want to do.
Oh, Amy Leondor. Yeah, it's my favorite
brand.
It's my favorite brand. I got a bunch of
Amy Leondor stuff. It's my favorite
brand. I just think it's classy. I think
it's a classy brand. Shout out Amy
Leondor. If anyone hasn't connected, Amy
Leondor,
hit your boy up. Sponsor me. A Leonor. I
know this isn't a clothing channel, but
I don't know. Send me free stuff. Is
that begging? I don't know.
Uh, good live. I am watching from Gaban.
Shout out Gaban. I hope I pronounced
that right. Shout out Gaban. Will new
courses be added to the master class as
more things come out and develop? Well,
Wasim 2K, I got good news for you. I've
already added a full second course since
launch. We have been launched less than
a month and I've already added a full
second course. So, to answer your
question, yes, to answer your question,
I'm way ahead of you. I already added a
second course. We added a full content
marketing course to it. Uh, XGrowth
Masterass. So, yes, we are adding I'm
adding a third course over the next
couple weeks for like super deep dives
on specific vibe coding topics. So yes,
I don't think you're dumb. I do think
it's dumb to not grasp that if everyone
can push the button, then the button
loses its value instantly. [music] No, I
think I think you have a zero someum
mindset. Smash the cash. AI is not zero
sum.
AI is positive sum.
You have a zero sum mindset. Smash the
cash. You have a Bernie Sanders mindset.
[music]
Right? How does Bernie Sanders, and I
don't want to get political here, but
this is a factual conversation we're
having here. How does Bernie Sanders
mind work? Zero sum, right? Oh, if there
are rich people out there, then that
must mean there are poor people, right?
Oh, if there are billionaires, that must
mean there are people starving because
billionaires exist. That's zero sum.
That's a zero- sum mindset. If some
people are happy, then other people must
be unhappy. So, we need to make sure
everyone's even, right? That's a zero
sum mindset. AI is not zero sum.
AI creates economic value.
AI creates economic value. Let me give
you an example.
I as a one person am building a very
complex video game right now. Before AI,
I could not build very complex video
games. In fact, I could not build 1% of
a simple video game before AI. Now,
because of AI, I'm able to create more
economic value because I can create
great video games. I put out Creator
Buddy. Creator Buddy's an AI that
creates content and helps you make
better content. That's making me
$300,000 a year. That's $300,000 of
economic value created. I could not do
that before. And now I can do that.
Because I'm making $300,000 on my AI
software does not mean someone else is
making $300,000 less off their software.
I created that economic value. AI
creates economic value. And so if
everyone in the world was using AI to
its maximum efficiency,
that's economic value created for
everyone. You're running on smash to
cash a zero sum mindset.
AI is not zero sum. AI creates value for
people. It creates value from nothing.
That's positive sum. So you got to work
on the mindset which is
positive sum.
You are able to because you have
intention and perspective and a holistic
understanding of what you're trying to
achieve and AI helps you achieve that.
That's not pushing a button.
Correct. But I think it could be
pushing. We don't cuz we haven't
achieved that yet. We haven't achieved
AGI, which I believe is pushing a button
and creating economic value autonomously
and proactively.
If I had it, I bet it would be creating
that for me by pushing a button, but
doesn't exist. So, I'm trying to build
it.
AI is not zero sum. It's positive sum.
[music] And I want to build something
that makes it as easy as humanly
possible. smash the cash to achieve that
positive s some value creation. Right
now I think it's too difficult for a
majority of people to experience that
value creation, right? Because right now
to experience that value creation, you
need to go into a chatbot and ask
creative questions. And I think for a
lot of people asking creative questions
for an AI is not intuitive and difficult
to do. [music] But if it was as easy as
pushing a button, I think it can be
done. If you push a button and then the
AI does research on you and learns about
you and finds your interest and learns
about your career and what you do
and then is able to think of ways for
you to create economic value and then it
just does those things for you.
I think that's AGI and I think that's
very possible.
There is no reason for a human to push
the imaginary button. The button pushes
itself at that point. That's human out
of the loop. That's not the goal.
Why isn't that the goal?
Why is that not the goal? I completely
disagree. That is the goal.
The goal isn't to make life as easy as
possible to have value creation
with no work. Like isn't that that is
then poverty is gone. If you can have
value creation with no work,
then poverty is gone.
Then hunger is gone. If you need val if
work is required for value creation,
there will always be poverty. There will
always be hunger because not everyone
can work, right? There will always be
people left behind. And I'm not saying
work is a bad thing. I'm just saying if
you can create a value creation system
that does not require human beings and
you can create infinite value and scale
that up and eliminate poverty
because I have purpose and meaning and
intention and perspective that I want to
paint into the world. That's okay. Then
do that. Congratulations.
Then go do it. Nothing stopping you. But
I want to create a system that creates
value for everyone.
Not everyone's experiencing AI right
now.
Not everyone's getting the value at AI.
A lot of people are being left behind
for one reason or another. And I want to
create a product
that creates value for everyone. Even
the ones that don't understand AI. And
listen, after poverty is eliminated
because AI is doing all the value
creation autonomously, you can still go
and work if you want. Becomes optional.
Go and do work and paint the world. What
do you what do you say here? uh
intention and perspective that I want to
paint into the world. All right, go
paint Go paint the world.
Smash the cash. Go paint the world. Who
cares? Do it. Paint the world. I want to
help the people that don't know how to
paint the world. Not everyone has what
do you say here? Purpose, meaning
intention. Painting the world. Not
everyone wants to paint the world. I
want to help those people out too.
I think y'all what is being missed in
communication is this. There are some
people who are capitalist by nature who
look for how things can make them money.
Others who are not won't look at it that
way.
As AI gets smarter and we replace the
ability to push the button, we will
become managers of the AI and then we'll
just increase from there.
Right? But we're not anything close to
that now at the moment.
We're not even we're not we're not
anywhere close to there. Right now,
where we're at with AI is you go to
chatgbt.com
and ask questions and then it gives you
answers in text form. That's where we're
at with AI. And I think that's a very
bad user interface [music] for the
future and what we want to achieve with
AI.
Then help them learn how to have
intention and perspective and purpose,
which I think you already do by the way.
You're like the best channel reai stuff
like this. Then help them learn how to
have intention and perspective.
I don't think it's mutually exclusive
though, Smash the Cash. I don't think
just because you have an AI autonomously
working for you, making your life
better, doesn't mean you can't have
intention and perspective and purpose.
Let me give you an example. Let me let
me paint in your nomenclature paint Let
me paint you some Let me paint you a
picture. Smash the cash.
And I want people's feedback. I'm glad.
Smash the cash.
I play around. I crap on people. None of
this is personal. We're just doing a
little sparring in the chat.
Let me paint you a picture. Say you have
Let me give you this user experience for
what I'm building.
You hit a button.
The AI goes, "Okay, Alex Finn, hit this
button."
The AI goes finds my ex.
Okay. He tweets about AI. Oh, he
announced um a new newsletter. Oh, looks
like he announced a new newsletter every
Thursday for the past four years. He
must send out newsletters every
Thursday. Then he looks at my YouTube.
Oh, he's live streamed every Monday,
Wednesday, Friday at 11 a.m. Pacific for
the last five months.
Oh, he releases three to four YouTube
videos a week about AI.
Let me go look at his newsletters. Okay,
he writes about this this Vibe Coding,
how to build apps. Oh, looks like he was
talking about Vibe Coding Academy, which
is a community with courses in it. Let
me see what the courses are about. Okay,
interesting. Okay, so here's what I'll
start doing. How can I help out Alex
Finn the most?
I'm going to start writing him
newsletter drafts. Get it into his inbox
Wednesday nights in preparation for
Thursday. He does the live streams
Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So, the night
before I will give him a rundown
document of all the big AI news from the
day before so we can talk about it on
his live stream.
Looks like he tweets about 5:00 p.m.
Pacific every night. Let me uh find a
rundown of the top AI tweets from that
day. Send it to him at 4 p.m. so we can
start prepping his content then.
Looks like he wears a bunch of really
fabulous Amy Leon door clothes. Looks
like they have a sale going on right
now. I'll send him that over. Uh oh,
also
he tweets about owning Tesla stock a
lot. He must own Tesla stock. Well,
there's been some brand new news on
Tesla. They're releasing this new car.
Let me make sure that gets alert to him.
I'll text him right now and let him know
about that.
That in my opinion is AGI.
How does that what I just described to
you smash the cash take away my
intention, perspective or purpose? That
did nothing but create economic value
for me. That did nothing but make
writing newsletters, creating videos,
doing live streams, vibe coding
significantly easier and better with
less effort. And I still have my
purpose. I still do those live streams.
I still create those videos. I still
write the newsletters. Maybe it's a lot
easier to do those things. Maybe we get
to the point where the AI is so good it
writes the scripts and writes the
tweets. All I have to do is hit send
send. But I still have my purpose.
So I'd claim that's creating a
tremendous amount of economic value for
me without eliminating my purpose. And
that's what I'm trying to build right
now. That's the product I'm building on
the side.
And all I did was mindlessly press a
button, as you call it. You're right.
All I did was mindlessly press a button
that caused all of that to happen.
Correct. But that did not eliminate
purpose. That just created economic
value.
Sam and Elon are watching the channel.
So keep that in mind when asking
questions. Correct. Watch your mouth.
Sam and Elon are Sam Alman and Elon do
watch this live stream. I I have gotten
confirmation.
I have gotten confirmation. Guys, Alex
literally knows all. Shout out Phantom
Platypus. My number one man
representing the Twitch community today.
For real though, AI on the other side of
the button is capable of all that you
described. It'll have pressed itself
before you get the chance to build the
button. We're not there yet. So, I want
to build that button. I want to be the
one that builds the button. I think we
ultimately agree. It's just framing
we're debating anyways. Me at distinct
disadvantage because I'm the one typing.
That's true. You are at a disadvantage.
Uh I'm the one talking with my face on
the big screen.
I can choose to ignore. If you make a
really good argument, I can just choose
to ignore that message and pretend like
I didn't read it. I can twist your words
any way I want. So, yes, I am at a
distinct advantage in this in this
little debate. Smash the cash. But I
appreciate uh you participating in it. I
appreciate you participating in this uh
debate even though I'm going to win no
matter what happens. I mean, mostly
because I'm right, but even if I wasn't
right, I'd still win. That's a good
position to be in. Get into arguments
where you win no matter what. That's a
good place to be in. Don't get into an
argument unless you're 100% guaranteed
to win. No matter what happens, no
matter what you say.
Alex, answer. Please. Please. Alex,
answer. Alex, answer my question. Answer
my question. Will you answer other
questions? Alex, answer my question.
Answer it, please. Alex, please. Alex,
answer other questions. Please. Please
answer my question. Please. Please.
Please shut up.
Shut up. I don't know what your question
is and I'm no longer interested in it. I
was in the middle of a very good
conversation. Dev very good conversation
with Smash the Cash. The fact that you
listen to that highlevel philosophical
debate on AI and the only thing you
think is answer my question please
please answer my question please means
you're you're you're in the wrong place.
You're in the wrong place.
the hell are you talking about? What's
I'm All right, here's what I'll do for
you. Dev.x, I'm going to find your
question. And if this isn't the best
question I've ever read in my entire
life, I'm banning you.
How about that? Let's make an agreement
right now. Dev, you have two options.
You can let go the fact I didn't read
your question, or you can
say, "Read my question." And if it's not
the best question I've ever read on this
channel, I'll ban you. Which one is it?
Ignore the question or read the
question, but if it's the worst ever,
you're banned. Which one?
Totally up to you. Fine. Deal. Which
Which side of the deal are you taking? I
read the qu. So, do I read the question
or not? We have a deal. Okay. So, I'm
going to read the question. Read. All
right.
I like I like the balls on you. Dodev.
I like the balls. If this isn't the best
qu I'm going to I'm going to scroll all
the way back for it. If it isn't the
best question I've ever read in my
entire life, I'm instantly banning you.
Got to hope this is a good question.
All right, here we go. I found it.
Let's see.
Can you confirm that you should prompt
small features one at a time instead of
asking AI to do a whole thing at once?
The poll's live.
Was that
Is that a banable qu? He be he begged
for 25 minutes for me to answer that
question. Is that a banable question?
The a listen the agreement we made was
if the question was not the greatest
question ever asked is banned. So shoot
which I'm not saying is the question
good or not. The question is is it the
best question of all time or not?
If it's not the best question of all
time, he's banned. So get in the poll,
banned or not banned. You didn't read
the follow-up question. All right.
What's the followup?
Like instead of saying build a whole
tracking system, you should ask it to
build a dashboard, then a header, then a
footer, etc., etc.
I'm going to answer I'm going to answer
the question. I'm just curious what
people are saying in the in the poll
right now. You're right now
people are doing this. You ready? Right
now.Dev people are doing this
not banned. 65% say you should not be
banned for that question.
Another solid question, but it's not
about if it's a solid question or not.
It's a question. It's about is that the
greatest question of all time. He begged
for 20 minutes for me to answer that
question. It's not about
is it a solid question. It's about is it
a banable qu is it the greatest question
of all time. That was the agreement.
That was the deal.
I I mean, I'll answer it and we'll
determine if we ban you or not.
Um,
it depends if you're using plan mode. If
you use plan, it depends on the
complexity and it depends if you're
using plan mode. If you're just building
a dashboard,
you can go into plan mode and say, I
want a dashboard with all these things.
and claude code with Opus 45 is smart
enough to like plan out the header, the
the footer, the text, all that all in
one shot,
right? Using Opus4 then the complexity
of a dashboard with headers and footers
and stuff is not too complex for plan
mode. If you want to build AGI, which is
what I was talking about a second ago,
yeah, I mean, you're going to want to
break it down step by step, right?
So you have to think of you have to what
I would say is get comfortable enough
with Claude Opus 45
where you kind of know what it can
handle what it can handle in just
straight shooter mode or what can handle
in plan mode and then you you'll get a
feel for what can be one-shot and what
can't I er don't things I towards the
side of build it out step by step
because you'll learn a lot more as you
go too
uh hopes to survive that scope of I got
a lot, right? Especially with plan mode.
The plan mode's incredible.
So, I hope that answers your question.
Now, are we going to ban you or not?
It appears like the chat's on your side.
There's been 30 votes and it looks like
it's 20 to 10. 20 people say do not ban
you. 10% say ban you.
So, um
right now it's trending toward you not
getting banned. Dev. Uh, so
congratulations on that. You can
continue to ask questions. Thanks, chat.
We have an empathetic chat. We have an
empathetic chat.
Dashboard can literally mean anything.
It's like Peter Griffin's mystery box.
Yeah. I mean, like, what are we going to
do?
I'm not gonna sit here and pro at him a
hundred different details. [music]
A lot of this was addressed in Alex's
Claude Code video from this morning.
That is correct. Watch the video from
this morning's popping off, people. The
video from this morning's popping off.
Everyone, after this stream ends, make
sure to uh Oh my god, it is popping off
like crazy right now. Make sure to watch
my latest video. I always worry like
when I live stream the same day I
release a video, uh, does it hurt the
views? Not for this video. This video is
popping off. Watch my latest video after
this uh after this ends.
Alex, I was I'm going to be honest.
There's no offense. Dev, I was a little
disappointed I didn't vote to ban you.
You're lucky. It was up to me to be
banned, but it's not up to me. It's up
to the chat. This is a democracy. This
live stream is a democracy.
The the coding people are getting upset
at me. The coding people are like, "What
are you doing? Build something." Sorry.
Apologies. I just came for the live
stream. I just did, too. You're not the
only one. I think there's a lot of
people in the audience that did as well.
Is Opus 45 nerfed in anti-gravity? Sorry
if that's a silly question. I'm going to
be honest. I don't use OP. Like, why
would I use Opus in anti-gravity?
Like, it's clear opus
was built for Claude code.
It's like saying
it's like saying, "Is the bagel at
McDonald's any good?
Why would I get a bagel at McDonald's
when I can go to,
you know, the local deli down the street
that makes fire bagels and go there
instead? It's like, I'm not even going
to try the bagel at McDonald's. I
already know it's not as good as the
deli down the street
that that boils the bagels there. You
know,
if I'm using anti-gravity, I'm using
Gemini 3.
Do you pin your video in the YouTube
chat? I don't know. Should I Should I do
that? Is that a thing? Is that gonna get
me more views if I pin my latest video
in the YouTube chat?
Am I going to get more views that way?
I want people to watch the live stream.
I don't want them to click off. Just go
to my latest video after this is done.
Once this Once this is done. Oh. Oh,
you're on you're on Twitch. Um Yeah. I
don't know. Just go to my YouTube after
this is done and watch it. Do your boy a
favor and leave a like down below. Leave
a like down below if you're watching
this. Leave me a like right now. I
demand it. I demand you leave me a like.
All right, here we go.
Where we at? Let's see where we're at
with this uh Vibe Code app store. We're
an hour in. We haven't done much here.
We We had a lot of chatting. I think the
chatting's been good so far. No, had
some good chats. Oh, we got more
questions fromdev.dev's really fueling
themselves. Will you see my website that
I made with Claude? No.
Think Tesla will ever make a minivan?
Well, they're making the robo van. I
want them to make like a full-size SUV.
That'd be sick if they made a fullsize
SUV. I'd be pumped about that. I have
the Cybert truck and it's great.
Cybertruck's incredible.
My partner picked up the Model Y over
the weekend.
She picked up the Model Y.
So, we're now a two Tesla family.
You guys want to see the new the new
family?
I don't want to do this show off, but we
are a Tesla. We are now a Tesla family.
You guys ready for this?
Here's uh
here's the new fam. This is the fam.
We got Sai on the right, Yolanda on the
left. It's Yolanda on the left, Sai on
the right. That's the name of our cars.
Pretty cool picture, huh?
Maybe you could give advice that people
may need to know of. I am unable to send
my product link here. I think I turned
off sending links. I don't want spam
links. All the crypto people come in and
send links once I enable links. Uh
what's the best alternative if you want
links? Uh join the vibe coding academy.
You can send links there.
The reason why you don't want to use
opus and anti-gravity is because Google
just doesn't like they're not going to
understand opus the same level as
anthropic. Right? You look at the
harnesses, anti-gravity is a harness.
Claude codes a harness. [music] Uh,
you know, Claude codes the harness built
by Anthropic and Integrity is the
harness built by Google.
They're going to build they're going to
know their models the best. So, they're
the best harnesses for them. So, if I'm
using Opus, I'm going to do Claude Code.
They're sick. Get them both wrapped. Uh,
the Cybert truck will be wrapped on
January
12th. January 12th, I'm getting it
wrapped.
I'm deciding between matte black and
glossy black. Originally, I wanted
glossy black. Now, I'm switched over to
matte black, but I saw a glossy black
Cybertruck a few days ago, and now I'm
now I'm torn again.
Is it really pronounced Tesla? Every one
of their mothers calls me out on this. I
don't know. I say Tesla. You want to say
Tesla? Tesla. Here's our Teslas. It's
easier for me to say Tesla. I don't
know. Just my I have a half Boston half
uh New York accent. Deal with it. Wrap
it in pastel yellow. Yeah, right.
One day I'm going to get my girl a pink
wrapped Model Y. I think Teslas look the
best wrapped out of any car. The only
car [music] I'd wrap. I wouldn't wrap
anything else. Maybe if I got a G Wagon.
I'm not nearly wing up the G Wagon. So,
&gt;&gt; you sat in black. Best of both worlds.
That's what I'm thinking. That's what
I'm leaning towards. Let's see where
we're at with the project. Okay, so the
Vibe app store project rundown. A
product hunt style marketplace for vibe
coded apps.
Okay, so we got everything in here.
Awesome. That was a good rundown. What
else do we need to add to our app?
Perfect the postings page. All right,
let's look at the postings page.
Where we at on the postings page for our
Vibe app store?
Cybert truck is banned in the EU. I
can't get one. Why would you leave? Why
would you live in Europe?
There's so many rules and regulations.
Like you can't buy a cyber truck. Like
that. That's how far they went. You
can't buy a Cyber Truck. Every other car
on the road in California is a cyber
truck. And there's been like nothing bad
that happened.
The fact that they banned the Cybert
truck like should be enough where you
go, "Okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving
Europe."
Shout out Europe.
I go there like every summer. I love it.
I love the visit. I would never want to,
you know, run a business there.
It's beautiful.
I'd argue in a lot of ways it's more
beautiful than America. I mean the
history I mean America [music] is not
old enough to have the history Europe
has right. I went to Rome over the
summer. Beautiful. Incredible food.
America food stinks.
Plastic everywhere. Everything you eat
tastes you you you don't realize until
you go to Europe how fake American food
is. Like you eat tastes like plastic.
You don't realize how everything tastes
like plastic until you eat European
food, which tastes incredible.
But at the same time, you can't own a
Cyber Truck in Europe. So screw that.
Like there's like
every successful company in history is
in America.
Factory pickup is the best program for
buying a new car.
Yeah, it's sick. Tesla's genius. What
skills do you think will be in high
demand between 2035 and 2040? Says AI
techniqu. That's a good question.
That's a good question.
What skills do I think will be hiding at
2035?
That's 10 years from now. So what skills
do I believe that's not the next 5
years, that's 10 to 15 years from now?
I think the biggest one will
I think all valuable skills
in the post AI world will be creative
skills,
soft skills,
sales, communication,
any sort of creative thinking. Anything
that requires creative thinking
will be the most val I mean I think it's
already there. Like I think we're
already in a place where creative
thinking is like the most important
thing you can do because that's the only
way to use AI right now is to creatively
think about how to use it.
But I think that only becomes more
important as kind of the hard skills get
uh abstracted away by AI.
So if you don't know sales yet,
learn sales. Read sales books, right?
Read
uh you know what's the book called? How
to make friends and
attract people, whatever the book's
called, read that. That's a good that's
a good one. Any sort of soft skills
books like that I think are very
important.
If you're early in your career, if
you're in like your your early 20s, uh
get a job in sales, become a BDR, become
an account executive,
learn how to sell, learn how to talk,
learn how to go to up to people cold,
tell them what they need to do, right?
Learn to grow a pair of balls to do
crazy things and say crazy things. I
think those are the most important
skills. I'm not sure if it's
anti-gravity generally itself, but there
are a lot of hallucinations with either
one of them. If it's anti-gravity or
cloud code cursor, yeah, there's tons of
hallucinations in anti-gravity. They
still have a lot a long way to go. I
think the app is great. I think their
their product
direction is fantastic in anti-gravity.
Uh they just need to work on the
execution a little bit. All right, so
here's the product listing page.
I'm going to screenshot this
and I'm going to go back into Claude
Code and I'm going to say how can we
improve this? I'm going to use Claude
Code as a creative partner.
I'm going to say make this a little
bigger.
Here is what the product listings
pages look like. How would you improve
it?
What are your thoughts?
I'm gonna paste the screenshot. Command
V. I'm going hit enter. Let's figure out
Oh, you can't see it because of the
question on the screen. Um,
we're going to figure out how to improve
these product listings pages. [music]
What can we build to assist with the
shop? Maybe an art theme chosen to help
allow us to contribute on the design
site. Oh, that's a very nice question.
has more rat.
I think the number one thing you can do
to assist with this shop
is one build your own apps, right? So
build apps you can post into it. That's
the number one thing if you want to
assist building this uh Vibe app store.
The number one thing you can do is build
build your own apps. Build your own
thing submit. This app's gonna suck if
there's only like four submissions,
right? People are going to come back and
look at the same four submissions over
and over and over again. They they want
like
an ever growing inventory of apps on
this store.
So, the number one thing you can do is
build your own apps that you have to
submit. And then I'd say the number two
thing is is when it launches, like just
engage,
ask questions on the listings. Hey, what
can I do? What what tell me about this
app? Whatever. you know, ask questions
to the makers, the builders, participate
in the community, talk with each other,
talk about what you're building, what
you're doing. Share out links on social
media.
I think that'd be the best way.
How's that sound?
I appreciate you asking that though,
Asalat. Thank you. I'm glad that you
want to engage and participate. Looking
at this, here are my thoughts. What's
working? Clean header with app icon name
tagline screenshot gallery make your
session clear empty description looks
bad no description provided add you can
either hide the section show a prompt
for owners to add one
number two missing info that we have we
built these features but they're not
showing text stack badges pricing model
GitHub link one sentence pitch change
log
sparse layout lots of empty space on the
left. The sidebar could include more
useful info.
No last updated button date. Users want
to know if an app has been actively
maintained. That That'd be a good one.
Let me write that down.
On product pages last updated fields.
See, this is the benefit of like working
with the AI and bouncing ideas and
getting creatives. It's coming up with
good ideas. We can add on to this.
EU is trash. I wouldn't go as far to say
as the EU is trash. I'd say their
leadership might be trash.
You know, they're driving away a lot of
innovation. They're driving away a lot
of businesses. The people are great.
Europeans are great. The food is
outstanding. The history is outstanding.
The beauty is outstanding. The nature is
outstanding. Uh but they have leadership
that does not want to see them win or
innovate or create economic value.
You can even mirror your iPhone to the
Mac. Forget a Cybert truck. You can't
even mirror your iPhone to the Mac.
Forget a Cybert truck.
The safety is better here in the in
Europe than the US. Um,
what in in what regards?
What what uh
what do you mean?
Like because there's no cyber trucks on
the road, everyone's safer. What do you
mean by that? I like states, but food is
really bad. Yeah, America's great. I
love America, but the food here's
obviously pockets of great food. You go
to any city, you'll find great food. But
I say on average, like I go to Europe
and anywhere eats blows my mind.
I want I built a product MVP. Should I
market it or go to building another
product? Well, if you just built more
products every time you built an MVP,
how would you ever successfully launch a
product? What sense does that make? You
got to try to market it.
Are the apps in the store going to have
GitHub links? Is that where they are
being hosted or is this true
distribution point for direct download?
So, I don't in my mind this isn't even
about downloads.
In my mind, this is just about listing
your vibecoded apps and having
discoverability and helping people
discover your solo built vibecoded apps.
I I don't think people are going to
download from here. I mean, they could
maybe I will give download links, but
it'll just be links to your site, links
to your app, description of what your
app is, so people can discover other
people's vibe coded apps.
Alex, will you share how much money you
have made out of building web apps with
AI? Yeah. Uh well, I only have one web
app that I launched that I built fully
with AI that's making money. That's
Creator Buddy. It's a $300,000
uh annual recurring revenue business.
Meaning
the amount of money it's on pace to make
every year is $300,000. It launched
10 months ago, so pretty good pace.
Um
my other business lines are YouTube. So,
the uh
ad revenue on YouTube, which I think's
on pace for like 60k a year.
Vibe Coding Academy, you know, I I put a
bunch of courses out in there. I do
weekly calls, things like that. That's
trending towards six figures a year. Um,
Twitter ad revenue, it's like 30k a
year. I get on Twitter ad revenue.
Twitter subscriptions are like 30k a
year.
Newsletter
newsletter sponsorships, newsletter
premium subs,
YouTube sponsorships. I think I've done
like four sponsored videos the last
several months. And those are just
videos where I open up. I say, "Hey,
this is a sponsored video by this
company. I'm going to take a look at
their tool. I'm going to give you my
unfiltered opinion. Thank you to this
company for giving me access and
sponsoring the video.
Can I get a story time like your
background and how you started etc.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'll give you I'll give you a
quick background on me.
My whole journey.
Well, I start I studied computer
science. I was a developer. Then I was a
sales engineer. Then I managed a team of
sales engineers at a company called
MongoDB.
And four years ago, I bought
a Cartoon Monkey NFT for $30,000 on a
whim.
And I went, "Holy crap, that was the
stupidest thing I've ever done in my
entire life. I got to make something out
of this." And I decided at that moment I
was going to start a Twitter account. I
said, "Hey, I bought this $30,000
Cartoon Monkey NFT. I'm going to make
like an anonymous online account and
tweet under that image. [music]
Maybe I could quickly get followers
because other people had that same
cartoon monkey and they go, I got to
follow this guy. Could be easier for me
to get a following. So, I started a
Twitter account called NFT god. I was
literally like, what is the most
obnoxious
handle could I possibly come up with
that will make the maximum amount of
people hate me? and but it will turn
heads and get me attention which is all
that really matters on social media.
And so I named it NFT god and I started
tweeting under that moniker. Uh and I
tweeted for a while. I tweeted for
years. I I kept my job. I would just in
between meetings fire off tweets. It was
pretty fun. And then I blew up. Six
months in I blew up. I got to like
10,000 followers. people just liked what
I had to say I guess about tech crypto
the world
business entrepreneurship to start
blowing up to 10,000
and then my big tipping point was about
two and a half years ago two and a half
years ago Elon Musk buys Twitter and
open sources the algorithm
and I was on X the moment he open
sourced the algorithm and I saw him
tweet it out in real time and I'm I'm
like, "Oh, I know coding. Maybe I'll
take a look at the open source algorithm
and write a tweet about it." And so it's
a Friday night. I pop open the open
source algorithm, the GitHub. [music] I
look through all the code. Like I sit
there for hours reading all the code,
seeing how it works, and I write like a
thread on how it works. And that went
super viral. Super viral. Uh Elon
commented and replied. Uh Mark Cuban
DM'd me and hired me for like contract
work. Uh it blew me up. I mean, it sent
me to like 150,000 followers. Like it
was my big tipping moment. And I'm like,
"Wow, this is amazing.
You know, I went from like kind of a
niche NFT god to like a mainstream
account." And I think there's something
here. I think there's something here. I
think I could turn this into something.
I don't know what it is, but I can turn
this into something. And so I quit my
job
at a, you know, a highpaying tech job
managing a team at a big public company.
I changed my Twitter account to Alex
Finn from NFT God, so I made it my face
and my name.
I started tweeting more about tech and
AI and things like that. And then uh
about a year and a half ago, July,
August
2024,
I stumbled upon an app called Cursor.
And I'm blown away. I'm absolutely blown
away by this app, Cursor. [music] Blown
away. Can't believe it. I mean, I went
from being kind developer to like
building full-scale apps in the second.
I'm like, this is incredible. This is
mind-blowing.
And I was so inspired by cursor. I was
so inspired by this technology coding
with AI that I started a YouTube
channel. I started my YouTube channel in
August 2024. I was just so blown away
and inspired. Didn't start a YouTube
channel to make money. Didn't start it
for any any reason other than I loved
coding with AI so much I had to create
videos on it.
And that started blowing up. And I I my
first app I built with cursor. The first
app I started building with cursor was
an app I called Your mic behaves weird
sometimes. The audio gets weird. I don't
know how to explain it. I don't know,
man. Wish I knew. Wish I knew. Uh the
first app I built with cursor.
I think it might be the background
music. I'm going to turn down the
background music a little bit.
The first app I built with cursor was an
app I called Creator Buddy, which is
basically just an AI trained in all your
tweets and posts. Uh, I released that
January of this year, 2025.
Hit 100K ARR in 15 minutes, hit 200K ARR
in two hours, and then hit 300K ARR in
like a month or so.
That takes off. It's around that same
time my YouTube channel took off. I went
from zero subs to 100 subs to a thousand
subs, 10,000 subs, all in a couple
months. And uh you know, I for the first
time in two and a half years of being
independent and not having a job and I
for the first time in 35 years on being
a human being on planet Earth
found a direction and found a purpose
and found a place to go, right? like
vibe coding, AI, AI coding. That is my
purpose. That's the reason why I'm on
this planet.
That's what I'm here to educate others
about. That's what I'm here to talk
about. That's what I'm here to do. And I
haven't taken a day off since.
I work 24 hours a day, seven days a week
on this and I love it. I haven't been
stressed for a moment.
since I started doing this. Zero stress
I feel at any time. Um,
and that's my story. That's how I got
here. And I like talking to people. So,
I started a live stream. There's no
purpose of this live stream other than
talk to you guys. The the sole purpose
of this live stream is to carve off two
hours every couple of days to make sure
I move forward on my coding projects
since I have to do a live and to talk to
you guys. Uh, I don't make any money
from these live streams. [music] I don't
sponsor them. Maybe I'll sponsor in the
future. Who knows? Don't pay me.
Anthropic pay me. Uh, I don't do
sponsorships for these. I just sit here
and I talk to you guys. I enjoy it. They
don't grow my channel at all. I get zero
followers from these live streams. I get
zero discoverability from these live
streams. There's zero pretty much zero
benefit from these live streams. I just
enjoy doing them and hanging out with
you guys and chatting with you. So,
that's my story. Yeah, your mic might be
ducking the music. Not sure set up. I
don't know.
No one has more audio issues than me.
Nobody. I'll turn down the music more. I
don't know. I don't know. Alex, you got
to take that clip where you tell your
story and put it somewhere. Where do I
put it? What is What is a good venue to
take a
eight minute clip
talking about myself? What's a good
social media site that likes eight
minute clips of me talking about myself?
It's not Tik Tok, is it?
Is that Tik Tok? Is that a t Did I
create a Tik Tok? Twitter? No. Twitter's
not the place for that. Is Twitter the
place for that?
Twitter. No one's If if you've ever
posted a video on Twitter before, you
know Twitter ain't the place for that.
There's not a single video in the
history of Twitter where they sat where
the audience sat there for more than 25
seconds to watch it. If you I post
videos on YouTube and the engagement is
like 30% till the end like at the end
30% of the audience is still there. You
post any video on Twitter
1% at the end 1%. No one watches past
the 30 second mark on any video when
they have Twitter.
Nobody ever
people who have similar aspirations want
to hear it and relate and feel inspired.
Not Twitter definitely not the place. I
don't know.
Maybe we'll just keep this for us. News
be for me and you. Me and you, the
people who sat here on Monday, December
22nd, couple days before Christmas,
hanging out, vibe coding.
Maybe you out like YouTube intro video.
Can I just post it as like an intro
video but not as a mainline video? I
don't know. Maybe I'll clip it and just
save it.
That too. Why am I seeing I'm seeing
like uh
I'm seeing different chats on the screen
in my stream than I am on my other I'm
seeing different chats. I don't know.
Whatever. What's your view on Bitcoin?
Uh bullish.
As long as governments keep printing
money, Bitcoin will go up. And I think
governments are addicted to printing
money.
I don't think we will ever have a
government
that does not print money.
They're addicted to it. If you give
people unlimited power, they will take
advantage of that unlimited power. It
just is what it is. We will have
governments until the end of time that
promise they will stop printing money
and inflating and then they will always
go in and print money and inflate.
There's nothing you can do. It's
infinite. So, as long as that is the
case, which I think will be the case
forever, I think Bitcoin will be will
have a reasonable bull case for Bitcoin.
I'm not one of those crazy like, oh,
Bitcoin everything, but uh I do believe
um
the government will not stop printing
money. And I do believe that is good
news for not only Bitcoin, but all
assets, stocks, real estate. The only
reason I'm not a big real estate
investor is I think that a majority of
people in the country and the world
want to see price of housing go down.
And so I don't want to invest in things
where most people want to see that thing
go down in value. So that's why I'm kind
of scared of real estate. I'd rather in
stocks because I feel like uh
everyone in the world wants to see
stocks go up. So, why would I fight like
the people? I don't know. I'm a believer
just buy a house and live in it. There's
no need to buy like a hundred houses.
That's kind of silly and a lot of work
when you can just buy either stocks or
Bitcoin. It just sits there and goes up
and takes almost no work.
What's your major? Computer science. I
went to a school called Wentworth
Institute of Technology in Boston where
I studied computer science. It is a
school where I got a 2.4 GPA. It is also
a school that basically allows anyone
in. If you apply, you get in no matter
what. This is kind of a I don't mean to
crap on my alma mo here. We're kind of a
dummy school where I got a 2.4 GPA. So,
I was not a good student. I was a very
bad student throughout all of school and
all of college.
I did not find my purpose until later in
life. I was a very
directionless youth.
Very directionless and purposeless
youth.
I didn't even do anything bad. Like I I
wasn't like a drug addict or anything.
Like I didn't I wasn't one of those guys
doing like doing crime and drugs. I just
didn't understand life for what the I
wasn't even I wasn't like this sounds
depressing but I wasn't even depressed.
I was just like
living life as a drone. I was just a I
was a uh
you know a passive viewer as life kind
of went by and then around 25 I kind of
discovered my path and jumped into life
and started creating a life for myself.
I'm I'm 35 years old. What's your How
old are you? I'm 35.
Am I shadowbanned? Lol. Why don't my
chat show up? I don't know. Your name's
Iawaska data scientist. So maybe that's
why. Yeah, I was an NPC up until 25
years old. I was an NPC.
Terrible grades. Didn't try hard at my
job. Didn't have many friends. Didn't
have any hobbies. Didn't have any
interests. Didn't have any things that
made me happy. Didn't have anything that
made me sad either. Wasn't a sad guy. I
wouldn't say I was a sad boy. Wasn't
depressed. Didn't have anxiety. I was
just
existing. I was just always I was just
existing for the first 25 years of my
life. Now I'd say like
instead of life happening to me, I think
for the first 25 years life happened to
me and then now from 25 to 35 I'm
happening to life. That [music] makes
sense. I think that's I think you got to
do some deep reflection about that
yourself if you're watching this is like
what what's your experience like? Is
life happening to you right now or are
you creating life? Right? Is life is
life happening to you or are you
creating life and it's coming out of
you? You know what I'm saying?
Are your circumstances controlling you
or are you controlling your
circumstances?
Right? You just waking up in the
morning,
you know, turning on your phone, getting
on the toilet, taking a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] scrolling
your phone for an hour, then going to
work, then coming home, then sitting on
the couch and scrolling your phone, then
going to bed. Is that your life?
Or you creating something, right? You
building something. You building a
business. You building a better future
for yourself. You building a skill set.
You're learning a little something here
and there.
What are you doing? Where you where you
heading towards? I I don't even think
you need a goal. I've never had a goal.
I don't have any goals right now.
The way I look at it, life is it's like
a pirate ship.
I don't know where this pirate ship's
heading. I don't know what's at the end
of the map. I don't know what's on the
other side of this water. I just want to
make sure this pirate ship's going in
the right direction. I'm just steering
the ship in the right direction. That's
all I'm trying to do every day. Make
sure it goes in the right direction.
You know what are you doing? Are you
sitting there as the pirate ship just
kind of floats in the water or are you
steering the ship and moving it forward
every day?
I'm self-studying computer science back
in dev. That's good.
It's a good move. I know the feeling.
Why would I want to understand coding in
assembly language in CS200? I checked
out in college as well. Yeah, I just
didn't care. Just didn't care. the chat
where you aren't seeing all the messages
probably set the top messages. Is it?
Let's see.
I don't know what's happening here.
Your mom
is heading towards the button. We're
heading I'm building the button. Who's
building the button here? I'm building
the button. I'm really torn between
Claude's UI front end and Gemini 3.0.
I I I don't think it's close to be
honest with you. I do not like any of
the UIs Gemini 3 has built for me.
I think the claw design skill is by far
the best UI designer uh in all of AI and
it isn't remotely close. And again,
Anthropic does not pay me. Anthropic
doesn't even talk to me. Gemini talk.
Google emails me out the wazoo. I've had
early access to everything they've ever
put out at Google. They love me at the
Google Google team and I love I I love
the Google team, but uh I'm just going
to be honest. I think the Claude's UI
front end design skill is mind-blowingly
good. Damn, Alex has me ready to run
through wall and that's what I want.
That's kind of the purpose of the live
stream. You want to learn things? I
mean, I want you to learn here, but like
if you want like hardcore learning,
educational, watch the the mainline
channel videos here. We hang out. We
learn things. We laugh. We live, laugh,
love. Make you want to run through a
wall. I give you a map. I give you a
direction of where you need to go. You
know what I'm saying?
All right. Where we at with this
building?
Make sure once this ends, you watch my
video I put out this morning. It's
popping off. It's popping off. The video
I put out this morning, people are
loving it.
People are loving the video I put out
this morning. Apparently, it's doing
well. Um, what are we building? Where we
at? Let's see where we're at. Let me
pull this open again.
What am I eating for lunch today? Oh, I
got leftover enchilada. I got leftover
enchilada for lunch. I'm going to do leg
day at the gym. Um, here are my
thoughts. What's working? Clean header
with app icon name tagline. Okay, so
here's a suggested improvement. Hi, show
tech stack as badges below category
in this vibecoded app store. Do you want
to see the text stack of all the apps in
there? Is that something you're
interested in?
Let's give the option for the creators
to display the text stack.
Should we make it optional to display
the text stack of the vid the apps you
submit to the app store or mandatory?
Klein, bro. Klein. What about Klein? Why
do I keep seeing messages about Klein?
What about Klein?
Klein, bro. Klein, what about it? Oh,
have you used Klein? Open source
extension and can use all the
proprietary models. Claude code. I mean,
I'm sure client is fine,
but like Claude code with Opus 45 is the
greatest AI tool I've ever used in my
entire life. Would you say client is
better than with Opus 45?
If not, then why should I use it? Also,
didn't their CEO just fire the guy?
That was
I mean, I'm not like a cancel culture
person where I'm like, "Oh, don't use
Klein because their CEO did this." But I
don't think that was very cool what the
CEO did.
I mean, listen, Klein, tomorrow morning
I wake up and it's the best AI tool on
planet Earth, I'll use it. I don't care.
Sorry to the guy who got fired but I
used tomorrow if it was the best but
it's not the best code with Opus 45 is
like what are we talking about?
What are we talking? Yes to text that
make it mandatory so people can learn.
All right let's make it mandatory.
Okay, let's add the tech stack
as badges
and make sure the tech stack is in the
workflow when people are adding apps to
the app store. I think it might already
be there, but I'm not sure.
You and Nate B. Jones both put out
videos this morning about Claude's
updates this month. Both excellent
videos. Who's Claude B. Jones?
Is that another AI creator on YouTube?
What's his name? Oh, Nate B. Jones. Nate
B. Jones.
AI News and Strategy Daily. Is that is
that Nate B. Jones?
See what we got here. Nate B. Jones.
Cloud code snuck in seven updates in two
weeks. Here's what you need to know.
Okay, I'll have to talk. I'm gonna
bookmark this.
Wasn't familiar with Nate B. Jones's
game. I got a list of like every AI
vibe coder on YouTube.
I did not have him on the list. Nate
B. Jones. Shout out him. Putting the
middle initial in there.
Sometimes you got sometimes you gota
just put the the nuts on the table and
say, "Hey, I demand call me by my middle
name initial."
Should I do that? Alex Tin. Should I
just start change the channel to Alex
Tin?
Uh, what's he got? 5.2,000 views in five
hours. So, he's doing decent. He's doing
a good job there. All right. Damn, he
gets a good amount of views. He gets a
good What? He He posts every day. Wow.
He's a He's a daily poster.
Okay.
Kilo is better. Forkked from Klein and R
code. Best of both.
Uh yeah, but is it better than claude
code? Like why wouldn't I use the best
tool?
reported degradation of Opus and Claude
Code, but not others like Cursor Klein.
What's your take on that? I use Claude
Code with Opus 45 every single day. I've
experienced zero degradation. I still
think it's the best tool on planet
Earth. It's building me incredible,
mind-blowing technology. I don't see a
single reason to switch off of it.
If anti-gravity figures out their stuff
and makes it so it's like bug free and
works really well, I'm switching. But,
uh, they haven't figured out their
stuff. So Nate Jones is awesome. Deep
thinker. All right. Well, at some point
Nate Jones have to pay me here with the
amount of promotion I'm doing.
Nate is a skate to where the puck is
going to be kind of guy. What am I, a
skate to where the puck is?
He has very different views than other
AI guys that I follow and thinks outside
the box on some stuff. I think you'll
like his perspective on stuff. not
trying to show. I think half the chat's
showing right now. I'm gonna have to
check I'll check them out. Listen, I'll
check them out. Everyone relax. I'll
check them out.
How long are his videos? 12 to 20
minutes. Around the same time as me.
That's good. I like that time range.
Like 15, 12, 20 minutes.
The app boom we're in is very
fascinating to me. What might you be
interested to seeing in the near future?
I'm interested in seeing a double
cheeseburger in the near future. I'm
going to be honest. Petrizzle,
I'm very interested in seeing a double
cheeseburger in the very near future.
You use claude code side by side a kilo
open material and run claude code in the
same directory.
You skate to the button. I skate to the
button. I like that. All right. Where
were we at here? Let me pull open again.
Uh, done. Here's what I changed. Text
stack and submit workflow already at
there. Okay. Text stack display move
from sidebar to header area for better
visibility. Now shows right below the
action buttons. Visit website.
Is this working? Let me see.
You move a puck forward. You Yeah, you
move the puck forward and not complicate
things. That's what I'm about. Let's
keep moving that puck forward. Let's not
make it complicated. Let's just move
Let's just do the simplest thing we can
do to move the puck forward. That's what
I'm all about. Skills are just a
directory of markdowns. And yeah, you're
just a bag of bones. I
was it was the matter. Yes, skills are
just a directory of markdowns and you're
just a bag of bones wrapped in flesh.
What does it matter?
And a cheeseburger is just
ground up cow meat surrounded by
goo that comes out of cow's uters mushed
together.
But it's more than the sum of the parts.
It's just ground up cow's meat mushed
between mold that comes out of a cow's
uters,
but I still eat cheeseburgers a lot.
Difference between rag and agentic
workflows. I don't know. Ask Chad GBT.
Who am I? Am I a living walking chat GBT
and ask me every question on planet?
What am I? What is this? Jeopardy.
Go to chat.com and ask me that question.
I ask a data time. Use some Iawaska and
maybe the gods will give you the answer.
Skills are markdown files of
descriptions and guidelines for skills
that get called by the agent.
Your mother is just a directory of
markdowns. I ask a data scientist. All
right.
see the app.
I'm I'm running on zero hours of sleep
right now. For the record, I did not
sleep a wink last night. Not a week.
I was sick the last seven days and then
last night I didn't sleep a wink. And
I'm doing this live stream and I'm
putting out videos
at 6:15 a.m. that go hyper viral. You
kidding me?
This is Take note. Take note. This is
how you become the number one vibe
coding channel on YouTube. Okay.
What is this? What's that button? Just
copy the link.
Uh okay. So now it's got the badge here.
AI. So it's got it shows you the tech
stack right here up above. It's got the
badge for each tech stack.
I like it. Can we upvote? We can upvote.
You can see the updates. You can add
comments. You can ask questions to the
maker. I like that. We're looking good
here. We're looking good here. Let's go
back. Let's go back to Claude Code. Bro
doesn't like me. Lol.
I like you, Iawaska.
I like you. What makes you think I don't
like you? I crap on everyone watching
here. Relax, dude. I crap on everyone. I
like you. Don't worry. I like you.
I like you a lot. I like you more than
you can imagine.
You might be my favorite.
Skills are specific instructions,
workflows, enhanced prompts with
description instructs cloud code when
they should be referenced for
instruction. Basically small bulletin
rag processes. There you go. Whoever
said, what was it? Iaska
skills are just directory and markdowns.
Yeah, you're right. I don't like you. I
forgot you were the one who asked that
question. You're right. I do not like
you.
You know, I do like Bart because he
understands what skills are. All right.
To test, submit a new app called Creator
for and select some technologies. All
right. Let's do that. Let's uh let's
create a new app in here.
Submit app.
App URL.
We'll say X.com. App name X. Tagline.
The best place
for bots. One sentence pitch.
Come here to talk to bots. Category AI.
Description
bots.
Uh, paste URL. Text stack. Here we go.
Anthropic.
CSS. Ozero.
Gemini. Playing chain. MongoDB.
This is all AI generated. That's pretty
good.
Please enter URL. Oh
URL.
Where'd it go? Damn it.
Damn it.
X.
Talk to
talk to bots. The best place to talk to
bots.
Don't you love talking to bots?
Uh AWS
Express, Google Cloud, LChain, [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]
Next, Open AI,
Submit.
Boom. All right, let's see. X.com.
Where's the text stack?
Doesn't display the text stack. All
right.
Did I need to do a
database update for this?
What's going on? Did we crash here?
Boy, they
What part of the country are you in?
California. What do you want my You want
my address? What do you want here?
Nicholas Graves. Um,
USA number one.
Number one, USA.
Uh, let me reset the server.
USA number one.
Not seeing the tech stack. Not seeing
the tech stack. Let's go back to Claude.
Huh? Let's fix this.
most effective way for me to get an app
idea.
I'll tell you
not seeing the text tag in the listings
page after I create an app.
Uh most effective way for me to get an
app idea thinking well yes that's the
best model I think for business ideation
there's two ways to come up with good
app ideas I have an entire module about
this inside the vibe coding academy so
if you want to be a part of that link
down below vibecodingacademy.dev
dev weekly calls of me, full Claude code
master class, full Hex Growth master
class, full hackathon going on right
now.
Uh there's two types of things you can
do for good ideas. You can come up with
an idea that solves other people's
challenges.
It's a good that's a good one.
Or you can sol you can come up with an
idea that solves your own challenges
in your day-to-day life. And I think
that's the best type of app idea
because if you create an app that solves
your own challenges,
the worst case scenario of releasing
your app, even if no one buys it, even
if not a single person buys your app,
you've at the very least made your own
life better. Right? If you build an app
that solves your own challenges, you
make your own life better, even if no
one buys it. So that's why I highly
recommend you come up with app ideas
that solve your own challenges. Now, how
do you come up with those ideas? I would
highly recommend
either opening an Apple note or I like
using pen and paper, carry around a
little notebook and every challenge went
into dayto day, the next few days, write
it down in the notebook. Write down that
challenge.
Right? For me with Creative Buddy, my
challenge was I like to analyze my
tweets
every night. For years, I was writing
down all my tweets in a Google
spreadsheet and going back and analyzing
it
by hand manually. Took me like an hour a
night. And so I wanted to build an app
that was powered by AI that would pull
all my tweets from X automatically and
analyze them for me.
And so I built Creator Buddy and I
launched it and I thought, hey, if even
if no one buys this, my life's much
easier, which my life was much easier. I
use Creator Buddy every single day. It's
helped my content creation process
tremendously.
Um, and the good news is other people
wanted to buy it and so a bunch of
people bought it. So those are the best
ideas,
Zane. And yes, I use Chad GBT thinking
to like develop those ideas. Boston to
Cali.
Boston to New York City to Cali.
And yes,
a fantastic decision. Fantastic
decision.
How would you roll out your app to
obtain customers?
We talked about this at the beginning.
Winner Circle family 397. Uh create
content. There's two ways, right? Paid
ads and non-paid ads. Paid ads are you
going on Instagram and buying ads or
going on Tik Tok and hiring some
13-year-old to dance and talk about your
app. Non-paid ads are what you're
experiencing right now as you watch,
which is organic content. You're
watching organic content. I name drop my
app. I name drop
Vibe Coding Academy. And if you're
interested in the pitch, you go and buy
the product, right? Completely free. I
think this is the best way to do it.
organic content, right? Because one,
it's fun. I have fun creating organic
content. Two, builds you a platform
which is infinitely scalable, high
leverage,
and can allow you to make money in a lot
of different ways. Um,
builds you a brand, builds you a
platform, builds you a distribution
channel. I think organic content is the
best way to do it. So, start tweeting,
start creating YouTube videos. If you
don't feel like doing it, do it anyway.
Stop being lazy.
Well, you're a smart man, Archist 54.
You're a smart man. Uh, we're up against
time. Do me a favor. Leave a like down
below if you enjoyed this. Do me a

stream ends, click on my name. Go back,
watch the video I posted this morning.
It is fantastic. It'll go over 10 new
updates from Claude Code from the past
month. 10 new updates, amazing updates.
Go watch the video. Watch it till you
hit it. Then watch it to the end. Let it
run to the end. Leave a like on that

master class in Xmaster class. Bunch of
things. Fun. It's fun. Or don't. It's up
to you. Um
we'll be back Wednesday. Wednesday, same
time, 11:00 a.m. Pacific. We will not be
