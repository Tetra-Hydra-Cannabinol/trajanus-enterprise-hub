In this episode, Amir takes us through
how to use Claude skills to build
digital employees. We go through AB
testing idea agent, marketing insight
agent, and then we build one live
together. You're going to learn about
what [music] cloud skills is, why it's
the biggest thing that happened since
sub agents, and how [music] to actually
build them yourself.
[music]
Amir, what are we learning today?
&gt;&gt; Today we're going to talk about claude
skills. I'm going to tell you what they
actually are, how they're different from
projects and sub agents and claude, and
why this matters, and how you can
actually apply for work.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And by the end of this episode,
are we are we going to be able to apply
Claude skills?
&gt;&gt; 100%. I'm going to show you first I want
to talk about what it actually is and
why it matters. But I'll show you how to
use existing skills in claude that they
just came out with and how to create
your own and how to apply for your work.
So whether you're in marketing, in data
analysis or any sort of document
creation, you can actually use skills to
do that.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Let's do it.
&gt;&gt; Cool. So first thing is I want to talk
about cloud. So not a lot of people are
familiar with cloud projects and I want
to talk about what that actually is and
why it matters and how it's kind of
related to skills. So within Cloud AI
specifically, you can actually create
projects and they're essentially
workspaces with a set of custom
instructions. So this is a system prompt
and it has relevant context, memories,
and tools. So say for example you're
part of a a broader marketing team and
you want to create a project that will
uh have a set of instructions to analyze
marketing data for example or generate a
newsletter and you want it to connect to
specific tools um have relevant context
and files. So this could be a glossery
of terms you use within your
organization, your brand guidelines
depending on the task it is that you
wanted to do and then also have memories
generated from the chats that you have
within that project. So it's really
great for collaboration with other team
members. Now you can also use it
yourself as well, but really uh the
ability for you to create repeatable
tasks and do you know certain set of
instructions with external tools and
data. So if I'm in a marketing team,
this is something that I want to look at
and essentially within cloud share with
my team members and create projects
around it. All right. So the only thing
with projects I would say that it's
important to one work with your team
members to actually refine the system
instructions and then always have
relevant context files. As your business
changes, the data changes, you need to
update it and you have to go back and
constantly update these context files.
Um and I'll talk about why context is
important in this specific session and
kind of how it ranks up against skills.
Now the next part of it is sub agents.
With sub aents, this is more relevant in
cloud code specifically. And I actually
use uh sub aents in cloud code to spin
up multiple agents. And multiple agents
are really great at breaking down
complex multiworkflow tasks into
individual tasks with specialized
agents. So what does that mean? Say for
example, you're building a very complex
feature and you want to delegate the
front end to one agent and the back end
to another. So within the chat, you can
actually spin up these agents to say,
"Hey Claude, create an agent that will
work on the front end using this set of
rules and then create another agent to
spin up to do the back end for it." And
what's interesting is the context is
isolated to that conversation window.
Um, and so whatever context is provided
or gathered in that conversation is
actually um used as an input, but those
agents have a set of system instructions
as well. Now,
where things get interesting is skills.
And I want to talk about kind of why
this actually matters. Um, skills are
automated workflows and tasks that you
can apply globally at a project or
individual level. So whether you're an
existing project, you have a set of
system instructions, you can use skills
which is an add-on or augmented skill
set um within that project or individual
chat and it can do a set of set of
tasks, create documents, create PDFs,
analyze documents, um it can actually
help build MCPS for you. You can use
skills to create other skills or create
you know visual art as well. Now when do
you actually use this? It's for very
specialized tasks based on the
constraints and guidelines and steps
built by you the expert. I think uh it
was Kaparthi um a couple days ago he had
an excellent analogy where it's like AI
is essentially your coworker or someone
that like reports to you. You want to
train it. You want to build the
guidelines. You know this is not
verbatim but like basically what he was
trying to say was yeah it's someone that
you work with and you can kind of build
the limit the constraints around it and
guidelines on how you want it to respond
to you. And this is kind of similar in
some nature. uh you can create for
example let's say you are a paid media
expert and you run campaigns for your
clients and you want a very detailed
analysis on your visit to booked
appointments and what the conversion
rates look like and how that attributes
to the different channels you have and
what's performing better than the other
in terms of campaigns. You can create a
scale that can follow a set of custom
instructions but also scripts that you
can build out yourself to analyze that
data. And I want to circle back later on
why that actually is important. Um, but
what's also interesting is that it
actually only loads context when it's
relevant to the task. So when a project
often times you have the LLM that's
determining which context to retrieve
and add into the conversation window and
reference it. Um but in this instance
it's only con based on the judgment of
the task whether or not it should pull
relevant context and it's just relevant
to exactly what you want to get done. So
I would say the key takeaway here is
that it's repeatable instructions. It's
laser focused on a set of tasks pulls in
context as is needed and it has the
ability to run scripts or run code to
perform specific functions. Why this
matters because um there's a paper great
paper out there called talking about
context rot and how essentially um talks
about how to do effective prompt
engineering and how the right amount of
system prompts from you know very
detailed to vague and the right amount
of context has a huge impact on
performance and as you add more context
you essentially could be you know I
don't want to quote on this but
potentially be like degrading
performance from the LLMs and likely to
lead to more hallucination.
Sam Alman, the co-founder of OpenAI,
just said that it is the era of the idea
guy, and he is not wrong. I think that
right now is an incredible time to be
building a startup. And if you listen to
this podcast, chances are you think so,
too. Now, I think that you can look at
trends uh to basically figure out uh
what are the startup ideas you should be
building. So, that's exactly why I built
ideaser.com. Every single day you're
going to get a free startup idea in your
inbox and it's all backed by high
quality data trends. How we do it?
People always ask. We use AI agents to
go and search what are people looking
for and what are they screaming for in
terms of products that you should be
building and then we hand it on a, you
know, silver platter for you to go check
out. Um, we do have a few paid plans
that, you know, take it to the next
level. uh give you more ideas, give you
more AI agents and more almost like a
chat GBT for ideas with it, but you can
start for free. Ideabra.com. And if
you're listening to this, I highly
recommend it.
&gt;&gt; I mean, makes sense, right? Exactly. The
more context you have, the less likely
you are to hallucinate.
&gt;&gt; Well, the more Well, well, yes and no.
The more context you have, you're less
likely to hallucinate. with the right
amount of context. So, it's like kind of
like like a like a coworker like do you
want to give them all the information or
just the right amount so that it doesn't
bombard them to get the right task done.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; So, that's that's what I would really
call um break it down into. So, I'm
going to go through some examples, but I
want to talk about the importance of
scale and why it's actually solving a
real problem that I have faced myself.
So with custom skills, how it works is
that you essentially uh create this
markdown file that explains exactly what
the skill is and what it does. And you
can actually create reference files that
it can reference back into for
additional context. So say for example,
you create a skill that uh applies uh
XYZ's company brand guidelines to
presentation and documents. And this
overview um essentially you know this
the skill overview has a set of tasks
and instructions it follows but you can
also have an additional document as a
reference that is an example existing
brand guideline document that it can
reference and it's not it's only pulling
it when it needs to.
You can take it another layer and you
can essentially create custom scripts as
part of that scale. Now um there's a
great documentation by Anthropic on this
and they talk about kind of how to write
good scales and descriptions. But what's
interesting is that when you are using a
cloud project and you have MCPs or tools
connected connectors connected the LLM
is determining which tools to call based
on your instructions and how to perform
that task. So say for example you have a
raw um like output of your meta campaign
ad data or your Google ads data and you
have a project in cloud that says like
it's a market analyzer. I want you to
your instructions are to analyze this
data and give me insights. The LLM is
determining
how to like the model is determining how
to actually look at the data and perform
insights and it's it's nondeterministic
in a way right like it's you know it can
look at it differently every single
time. um and you're not giving the right
guidelines on how to actually take the
data and analyze it. And I've seen this
firsthand actually working with a lot of
clients where like you know um a
director of revops is looking at churn
data new subscription data and um
they'll put the file into the cloud
project and it's not giving the right
output of insights they're looking for.
How this gets interesting is you can
actually create scripts that are very
specific. So say for example um if you
wanted to um have a very set of strict
guidelines on how it should actually run
and analyze the data then you can create
that within the scale itself to say I
want you to look at column X Y and Z
multiply by this divided by that to the
power of this to give me this insight
that way it's actual functional code
that's running this and it's not
deterministic nondeterministic by the
model itself. Y
&gt;&gt; so um so yeah that that's kind of the
beauty of skills itself where uh you're
able to really um bound or create the
boundaries of what I should actually
work towards um for um yeah for for like
building out these skills.
So yeah you can essentially have
metadata with it resources and code you
can load it as needed and it kind of
breaks down exactly how you should write
these skills.
&gt;&gt; Now let's jump into some examples.
&gt;&gt; Let's do it. This this the fun part. How
do you actually apply this? So, the
first one we're going to go through is
an artifact builder.
&gt;&gt; So, you can actually go to Claude and
it's preloaded with some existing
um skills. So, we're going to go to
capabilities and essentially you'll see
there's some existing skills that are
preloaded. So, I have created these two
ones right here. We'll go through them,
but I want to show you the ones that are
already already in there. So, you can
have an artifact builder, an MCB
builder, and a skill creator. So it's
very meta. You can create skills with
skills. So we'll go through an artifacts
builder one and I'll show you an example
of what that looks like. So say for
example, you want to create a tool that
is um relevant to marketers. Marketers,
you know, when they run campaigns, they
always have to have UTM links to do
proper attribution back to their data to
see okay, which campaign was driving the
most and when they're seeing the
analytics. So here um you know I have
added the artifacts builder skill
please create a UTM link generator for
my marketing team. So
what's happening here is that Claude is
now going to reference that skill
specifically that we have defined. And
I'll show you what that skill looks
like.
&gt;&gt; And essentially, it's reading the
documentation to understand how to build
components. Artifacts are essentially
these like live apps within cloud itself
that you can create very functional web
apps. And you can also share with your
team as well. So what it's doing is it's
actually referencing that skill here and
now creating an artifact/web
app of a UTM link generator that
marketing teams can use. And you can
actually just share this with the rest
of your team as well or your entire team
can use this as well. I mean, it's
literally a web app.
&gt;&gt; It's literally a web app. But what's
interesting is
&gt;&gt; we're now creating a set of specific
instructions and skills. We're adding a
skill to this LLM now that knows has to
follow this versus before you're saying,
"Hey, code this web app." And it's kind
of you're not really defining the the
guard rails or the the parameters of
what it should do.
&gt;&gt; And and what happens is people get
frustrated that they're not getting the
right result.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; And then they're like, "Oh, you know, AI
doesn't work for me."
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. So this is
where it gets interesting, right? Like
you as an individual, you have the
opportunity to um work with Claude and
skills to build exactly the skill you're
looking for to do. That's a repeatable
task. So if you as a a marketer are
doing weekly tasks of reporting,
create a skill that can actually help
you with that. Just explain to it in
terms of what you're looking for, what
you need. Be very detailed. if you were
to assume that you're hiring someone
else to do it for you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it really is I mean, it
really is thinking about AI as a
teammate.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Especially a junior teammate.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; That you have to really give it guard
rails and really give it context cuz
that's how you would, you know, if you
hired someone junior, you would be like,
"Okay, these are the tools that you're
going to use." because they don't know
the tools they're going to use because
they're new. This is the context that
you need to know about our business and
how we operate. And then you kind of
drip feed them. You don't want to
overload them, right? Cuz then they're
going to they're not going to remember
everything or they might, you know, it
might Yeah. just might be overwhelming.
So you drip feed them the context over
time.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. But what's also interesting is
if you start now as these models get
better and as the toolkit expands you
now have this like history of like
training and reference and and metadata
and memories that you've created over
time now then so like someone like me
who uses cloud a lot I now have a lot of
pre-context of like memories and
experience building these projects now I
know exactly how to use skills and apply
it here. So I think that's where it gets
really interesting. Um, I generally
think scales is probably the a huge
problem solver for a lot of problems
I've seen firsthand working with people.
Like I've worked with a lot of teams
right now that have actually like a lot
of go to market teams that have used
cloud as part of the workflow and the
number one um feedback I get is the
output was not on what I expected or
it's incorrect. There's two reasons for
that. One is the promp prompting is not
good, right? the prompter
&gt;&gt; the prompter it's the problem is them
but the latter of it is it's also the
you can prompt you know I worked on with
them on right setting the right guard
rails the prompts the access to tools
the right retrieval of context and it
still doesn't get it just right and I
think this is where skills come in and
solves that problem where it's just that
task so you now have an artifact that's
fully functional and working you can
actually share with your team members if
you wanted to and you can essentially
like provide a URL like humble.com or
ideabrowser.com and it will append
um um the rights like Google and you
know CBC you know
was it Black Friday Cyber Monday? Yeah,
something like that. And it'll actually
create those um I will append it for
you. I don't know why there's a clear
button. It should be a submit button.
You can also sell this to other people
as a as a product, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I think uh Claude in
collaboration with someone else created
this like repository of skills. I I
don't I I I don't want to butcher the
name so I'm not going to say it but
basically there is a directory of some
sort with skills and plugins because
they recently came up with plugins as
well which is like a collection of
context and pl tools and skills and
prompts allin one that you can install
for your cloud workflow. So there is a
huge opportunity for people to sell
skills. Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Sorry. What's the difference
between plugins and skills? So yeah,
yeah, plugins just came out last week,
which is like a plugin. You you plug it
in and it has ancillary features,
&gt;&gt; MCP access, context, system
instructions, and I think skills now.
I'm not don't quote me on this. Cloud's
been shipping. Cloud's been shipping.
I'm having trouble keeping up.
&gt;&gt; You know, when I was I was building this
out, when I was writing this out, I was
like, I'm trying to understand what
skills is. And as I was actually
building with it, I was like, it's clear
to me. Cuz initially, my gut reaction
was this is over complicating it. How is
this different from projects,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; And now I understand why.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, uh yeah. So, we we
essentially, you know, https idea
browser.com.
We can go Google CPC
Black Friday Cyber Monday and then
generate the URL and we have a URL.
Boom.
&gt;&gt; So, that's one use case. Let's make it
more interesting. Um I am interested in
finding AB testing ideas for my website.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I have a skill that essentially
looks at AB test generator and what it
does is that you provide a URL and it
will come up with headlines or
experiments for you to run for your
website to increase conversions and it
actually uh the skill I created the
skill using the skill creator. I said
I'm going to give you a URL and you're
going to run a framework on actually how
to run good AB tests for me. So we're
going to test this and see what it looks
like and then I'll show you an example
of how to create your own skill as well.
So, hey Claude, I have just added I have
added the AB test generator skill. Can
you run an can you provide me with AB
experiment ideas for humble.com?
And what this will do is here because I
have access to uh an FCB called
firecrawl, it would actually use
firecrawl to scrape the URL, the page
and the contents and then come back with
a very clear framework on experiments to
run. So while that's running, maybe I'll
just show you an example of what that
actually looks like. And essentially, it
looks something like this. So it gives
you an experiment pipeline impact,
confidence, ease, um, IC score. And, um,
you know, it was actually a really good
one. I actually did it right before this
call, before the session today was it
asked me to, it told me to actually test
um, shifting the case study that I have
above
one section above. So it's like hero
section and then case study go to
immediately social proof and I was like
damn that's a good idea like [laughter]
why am I showing the features when I
should show do the social proof. So I'm
running AB test right now to see which
one is likely to drink drive more
conversions and signups. So um that's
interesting like it really breaks down
exactly the control the variant the
headlines you should be testing. So,
experiment number one, experiment number
two, and if I really wanted to, you
know, just take this, put it into my
app, and then run run through an
experiment.
&gt;&gt; You know, would be really cool if you
can automate this so that you, you know,
every month send me a report.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What to change?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly. So, um, if you really
wanted to, yeah, you can. You can
probably write a skill, uh, that I
wonder if you can. I wonder I wonder if
you can already do that today where you
write a skill that writes a script that
automatically sends you rapport every
single week or every month. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Why not?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, you know, I am going to plug
in my app and say we do that
automatically in our app. So every week
we we have like four sets of sub agents
that go through your website and give
you insights from like a copy conversion
marketing like um a designer as well. So
every week and then we give you like an
optimization score. So similar um kind
of similar approach here but I think
doing that within cloud is actually
really interesting as well. Now what I
really really really want to show you is
a problem I've been trying to solve for
the past couple months with these
companies I've been working with which
is take data and give me the insights
that I actually want to look at. It's
such a repeatable task and it's so
important that
I think I can't confirm yet skills has
probably solved that problem for me now
in a way. So um I uploaded a file called
traffic analytics. It it's just
basically like a a CSV of um just a
bunch of campaigns and you know revenue
data and whatever. And I was like, I
need some insights on this. And that's
what really matters to a lot of people
in terms of just did cost go down did
you know CBC go up down? What does the
trial conversion look like? XYZ. So I um
I provided a file and it referenced the
scale and has a set of scripts within
that scale to then do a comprehensive
analysis of the data the traffic data.
So overall performance your total spend
was 400k your revenue was 854K.
uh net profit, conversions, which
channel did better than the other. Um so
you have a clear idea and I'll be honest
like I you know you know I am going to
be honest but um I would say that I I I
would I would say that if I had done
this through a project and I just
uploaded a file with set of instructions
without running scripts, it would have
probably hallucinated some of the data.
That's what I was going to say because I
&gt;&gt; when I look at this, this feels
this if this wasn't in in Claude and I
had a product manager send me this, I
would be like, "Yeah, you know, this
feels like that level
&gt;&gt; of fidelity." Um, it just, you know, it
just it it's
&gt;&gt; it looks right.
&gt;&gt; It looks right.
&gt;&gt; I mean, I can't confirm cuz I don't know
the I didn't look at the Excel, but I'm
just just looking at it looks right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does. Yeah, exactly. So, and
and I'll show you what it looks like
essentially within the breakdown of the
skill itself. So, skills um what you do
is you have the actual skill.md file
itself. So, this again is a breakdown of
what the skill is, the scripts it should
run and then yeah like generate data for
90 days, generate data of 7 days,
generate data for 10 campaigns and then
what the structure should look like. So,
you can actually use this to define it.
And you know if I want to take a step
further I can use cursor to then update
the scale itself. Um and I'll show you
an example of how to create your own
scale. And then you can also reference
files. So you can see here it says see
references metrics MD for detailed
metric definition and typical ranges. So
if we want to go back into references we
can see what metrics MD has which is all
the you know definitions or glossery. So
as a marketer, you get to define what
these are and you should be doing that
so that you know when you run these
scripts and skills, it gives you exactly
what you need instead of getting the LLM
to actually do it for you. And then the
scripts are made by cloud itself where
it's running a Python script on, you
know, calculating all this for you. So
it's accurate in some way or another.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Um let's see where we are at.
Yeah. So let's now create we we've gone
through AB testing ideas. We created an
artifact. We got some working insights.
I think we should now just create our
own skill. Do you have anything in mind?
Tell me if this is possible. So
I tweet every day
&gt;&gt; and I also have a newsletter and every
single week I
basically I use my tweets like if it
rips on Twitter I'll kind of expand on
it on my newsletter.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um, I have a specific type of
style how I write on my newsletter. So,
what would be really cool like this is
some this is something I would hire for
potentially like almost like a ghost
writer.
&gt;&gt; So, is it possible to have a skill that
basically like looks at my tweets and
turns it into long form content that I
can review and and be the editor of?
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's try. Let's let's let's find
out. Um, we're doing a lot. You're like,
"Maybe."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, absolutely. I think I think we
can figure out we can we can try. So,
hey Claude, I just added the skill
creator skill. So, we're using the skill
creator to do that. Can you make me a
skill that takes an existing tweet
provided by the user and turns it into
long form content for LinkedIn
&gt;&gt; for uh
&gt;&gt; for newsletter
&gt;&gt; newsletter
&gt;&gt; for newsletter. Okay. So I would I think
what what I would do in this scenario is
making sure that we have a reference
file, right, of your existing
newsletter.
&gt;&gt; I would need a and would you need like
an export of all my tweets?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we can try
to do one example one right now and then
um
&gt;&gt; and then see. But ideally what I would
do is actually I actually have this I
have an automated bot that looks has all
my tweets and then finds the most viral
ones and tries to like expand on it.
Ideally, we we would export all of your
tweets.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then
&gt;&gt; and then, you know, we would in order to
keep it updated, we would need to make
sure that we're, you know, constantly
updating.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So, um, while
that's running behind the scenes, I'm
going to scrape I'm going to get some
examples of, uh, of your posts on
Twitter. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's me.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what's a good tweet? Yeah. You
find a tweet that like speaks to you and
then we'll
&gt;&gt; Okay. I like this one actually. It
speaks to me.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Pricing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, this is a perfect one cuz
it was too long for Twitter.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But I'd still posted it anyways.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Um but if I did even if I did this on a
newsletter, I would totally expand on
this. I got you. And then um
&gt;&gt; for the newsletter, where's where's the
best? I mean I I
&gt;&gt; I don't even know if you can
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How do I
&gt;&gt; find it? Go to I think Greg Eisenberg.
Do gregisberg.k.com.
&gt;&gt; Um All right, cool. So, let's take this
actually and
we're going to
copy this and then create
notes.
Export this example newsletter.
&gt;&gt; Export it as a markdown. Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. As a markdown. Exactly. Exactly.
So, we're going to go back to Claude
now. So, now that we have an example
tweet post and example newsletter, um
we're going to um up uh we're going to
upload that as a reference file in there
as well. So, what we'll do is let me
just drop this in here. Add these files
as references. You know what's
interesting is they actually gave you a
zip of the scale for you to upload. And
we're saying now like add this as a
reference into that scale.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Stuff is happening.
&gt;&gt; Things are happening. We're seeing
instructions. Yeah. So, we're adding
instructions. So, similar to I showed
before where there's instructions to
reference the file in the folder, we're
going to see a zip now with a folder
called references. And if you open it
up, you'll see these two examples in
there. Boom. So, now we can essentially
download this and re-upload it back into
Claude.
There you go. Sweet. Okay. Two
newsletter. And we're now going to go to
settings, capabilities,
upload a skill, and we're going to
upload tweet to newsletter.
And now we're going to write the skill.
Try in chat. I just had the skill. Can
you turn this tweet into a newsletter
format? And you you're going to be the
judge of this. Tell me if you think it's
good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um, so we'll go back.
You know, we already had it, but I'll
just copy paste this to see how it
works. Okay,
and we'll go cloud. Let's see what
happens.
I'm honest. I'd be surprised if this
crushes it on the first try cuz think
about how
I don't know. I'd be surprised. I hope
it does. So, I'm I'm I'm very curious.
It's like I this is we're doing this
live and I'm curious to see how it
actually comes out and I want to get
your honest take on it, right? Because
for me, at least from a data standpoint
to get the insights, I think it's
interesting. Um cuz like there was
challenges with projects before to get
the right insights. So
&gt;&gt; honestly, this is fire.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; I mean, so tone of voice. So, we just
did this in one shot, but if we really
wanted to, we would take all of your
existing tweets, all of your
newsletters, and then use that to
generate a like a style guide or tone of
voice, and then kind of refine this. But
as a starting point, it's not bad.
&gt;&gt; As a starting point, it's not bad. And I
I I'll even take it a step further.
Like, this is
&gt;&gt; It's actually not bad.
&gt;&gt; Really good.
&gt;&gt; It's actually not bad at all.
&gt;&gt; Until next time, keep building and keep
raising. Not keep raising.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't,
&gt;&gt; you know, but keep building. I like
[laughter and gasps]
uh forward this to a founder who's been
sitting on the same price point for too
long. Like I like that. I think that's
really smart. Right.
&gt;&gt; We talking about product market fit. We
should talk more about price
&gt;&gt; pricing market fit. Like that's a that's
a banger.
&gt;&gt; That's a banger. That's actually a
banger.
&gt;&gt; Like if I tweeted that as its own
oneliner like that probably would do
really well.
&gt;&gt; Oh, until next week.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100%. Now, it would have been
interesting if it like if we you know,
we could technically say, "Okay, now go
scrape like tweets and embed it in
there." Yeah, that would be really cool.
And the cool thing is you can actually
create skills now.
&gt;&gt; Dude, this is crazy.
&gt;&gt; Actually, yeah. Here's where it gets
interesting though, right? Cuz you can
now create skills that generate visual
graphics cuz that's that's a thing now.
You can so
&gt;&gt; you can you don't have to do MCP calls
like Canva or anything like that. You
can programmatically create these
visuals. So we can update the skill to
say, "Hey, now add images as well in
there."
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; this is pretty good.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you know, we covered why
projects matter, how it's different, I
think, from skills, and I think we got a
good idea that skills are probably more
deterministic in terms of what you want
to do in terms of how you want to define
the skills and you can now do
programmatic code in there with MCBS and
tools and how impactful context is.
&gt;&gt; Yep. and uh you know essentially how it
differs from everything else. So and
we've covered some use cases as well.
The last thing I want to talk about is
kind of just like you know I saw this
report I don't know if you if you saw
from ramp where they were tracking
subscriptions for like different AI
tools and they saw that there's a dip
happening and they're saying there's
getting stickier in enterprise but the
AI is off ramping and it's not as sticky
as we want it to be because cost is
coming down. I actually want to say now
with what we're seeing with skills and
all the education and awareness around
prompting we should be able to solve
that gap because the reality is a lot of
companies are investing in AI and
there's reports now saying that it's not
actually being as productive as we
thought.
&gt;&gt; The issue is I think prompting and
context
&gt;&gt; the issue is people.
&gt;&gt; The issue is not Yeah. Yeah. That's the
reality, right?
&gt;&gt; There isn't enough AI fluency and
education around how to actually do
prompting. People like write, you know,
build me a SAS 1 million AR, don't make
mistakes, you know, and the reality is
like, no, no, you got to give the right
amount of context and do some prompt
structure. And um I think when it comes
to anthropic, they do a really good job
of not only building with intention, but
creating the resources, the education to
help people actually become more AI
fluent and giving them tools to do that.
And they're very deliberate with what
they create. And it's actually real
problem solvers. Like I've never seen a
company so dialed into customer feedback
and just creating something around it.
It's almost like they heard me in
conversations about what issues I'm
having and you know why skills matter.
So um the net of this takeaway is AI
adoption may be falling and the adoption
rates may be down for this month or this
past quarter. I think part of it is just
because companies don't have the right
resources and the people to build
education um on AI enablement and AI
fluency and then once we see that come
into play adoption is going to come back
up and there's the tools now to support
that.
&gt;&gt; Beautiful. Well, thanks for explaining
it to me honestly and everyone else. Um,
&gt;&gt; for more of air, uh, I'll include links
in the show notes where you can go ahead
and follow him. Uh, X is the best place.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Air MXT. A M I R MXT.
&gt;&gt; Cool. I appreciate you coming on.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Thanks for having me.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, man. Thanks.
