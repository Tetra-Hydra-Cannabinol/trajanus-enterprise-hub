In the next 10 hours, we are going to
build 15 awesome projects using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript. These are
beginnerfriendly projects that are
designed to help you practice and level
up your skills. We have things like a
quiz app, expense tracker, currency
converter, recipe search, GitHub finder,
you name it, we have it all. You will
find the timestamps in the description
so you can jump to any project anytime.
If you know the basics of these
technologies, you are all set because
everything is explained clearly and step
by step. And the source code of these
projects will be free in the
description, which means this course
doesn't cost you anything. And if you
would like to support this content, you
can subscribe, leave a like, and add a
random comment for the algorithms. And
if you're looking to build full stack
real world projects, we also got a
100hour premium course where we built
apps like Tinder Clone, Netflix,
Spotify, Twitter, and Amazon. It's been
getting great feedback from everyone who
has joined so far. So if you're
interested, I'll leave the discount link
in the description. So with that being
said, if you're ready, let's get into
it. Okay, so just before we get started,
I wanted to mention a couple of
different things. So the first one is
that I am using VS Code from start till
the end. Um if you wanted to get the
exact same thing just head over to VS
Code and install it. Super easy, super
clean to work with. The other thing that
I'd like to mention for every single
project I will create an empty folder
that you can call this anything right.
So I will put the project name. This is
just a like example name but we will
have three different files that will be
index.html
style CSS file and then the
script.js file. So we're going to have
the HTML CSS and JavaScript in all these
files. And then there is one extension
that I'd like to mention. Now let's say
H1 and let's say hey how do we see this
output? So you have to install the live
server extension which is something that
that I already have. So just go ahead
and install it. Then you can press right
click um and then say open with live
server. Now let's put them side by side.
This is the output that we just got.
Okay. Now let's say hey 1 2 3. As soon
as you update and you save it is going
to update the output. So, this is a
really important extension that you
should install. And if you're wondering
about my theme, I'd like to mention that
one as well. It is called
Houston. You know, just in case if
you're wondering, you can install it. I
really like this theme. Okay. So, one
last thing which will be the diagrams
that you can find the link in the
description completely free. Um so
basically whenever we build an
application first you can take a look at
these screenshots this is the output u
this is the end result for the quiz
application right and if you wanted to
build it by yourself you can take a look
at these styles or these designs that
I've just put right here and then one
more thing time to time we'll be copying
and pasting some really boring stuff and
this is a GitHub gist that I have
created the link will be in the
description
Now throughout this tutorial I am using
Mac but if you're using Windows it's
completely fine. There is almost no
changes at all. Okay. So these are the
things that I wanted to mention just
before we get started. And at the very
end I have included one bonus project.
So in total we're going to build 16
different projects. I hope you will
enjoy every single one of them. If so
don't forget to subscribe and let's get
started with the very first project. All
right. So let's get started. In this
section, we're going to build a quiz
game. And before we jump into the code,
I'd like to show you the end result so
that you know what you're going to have
at the end of the section. So, this is
the UI that you're going to get when you
first visit the application. We have a
button where we can start the quiz. I'll
just click to it. The UI will be
updated. We got a question and how many
questions we have in total and what is
our score as well as a progress bar. So
let's go ahead and answer some of these
questions correctly and some of them
incorrectly. So here we go. We got
different feedback depending on our
answer. Right. So let's try to complete
it. Okay. Now once we are done with it,
we are going to get a feedback as well
as how many correct answers we have.
Depending on the answer, we will have a
different feedback. So if this was five
out of five, you would get something
like perfect, you're a genius, something
like that. And if you got like one out
of five, it would say keep studying,
you'll get better, and you can just
restart the quiz. So this is the end
result. This is what we're going to
have. Now, let's just jump into the
code. So I just have an empty folder in
my VS Code. This is the name that I came
up with, quiz-ame. You can call this
anything. Just go ahead and open this
up. Now we're going to have two I mean
three different files. I'll say
index.html. Let's create
style.css as well as the
script.js file. These are the convention
names. You can't really call them
anything but most of the time this is
what we're going to this is what we're
going to call them right. All right. So
the first thing we'll be doing get
started with HTML. Then we're going to
put the styling and finally we will put
the JavaScript to make it functionally
work right. So let's go into the
index.html and I can just zoom in shrink
the left hand side and just get the
boiler plate code with this exclamation
point with VS Code. All right, let's
just put the title. Let's say quiz game.
And then we can link our CSS file,
right? We can say link colon CSS. Here
we go. If your file name was something
like styles, let me put styles.css, then
you would come here and update it. But
if you go with the style, this is the
benefit in VS Code, right? If you just
say link CSS, it is the correct name.
Okay, so this is one thing that I'd like
to mention at the beginning. Now, we'll
go ahead and build the uh HTML part,
right? The markup. So I'll go ahead just
right inside the body I'll say I'll have
a dev that will be my container. So I'll
say class container and then the other
thing we would like to have is the start
screen. Now let me display pretty
quickly. When you refresh this is the
start screen. Right when you say start
quiz the start screen will will just
disappear. And this is what we call the
quiz screen. So we're going to build two
different divs for them. I'll say one
div and let's duplicate
this. Give a bit space. This is going to
be the start screen. I'll say class. It
will take the class name of screen. And
initially this will be the active. And
then let's put a uh put an ID so that we
can select it in our JavaScript file.
I'll say start dash screen. You can call
this anything but I would say just
follow along with me. just do whatever I
do like at least until you complete the
project. Once you are done with it, you
can go ahead update anything. Uh just
customize the project, make it your own.
But if you're following along, just go
with me so that we can have the exact
same output and you don't really
encounter any problems. All right. Now,
the first thing we would like to have is
the H1. I'd like to just put them side
by side.
Um, let me take this if I can take that
correctly. Okay, for some reason I
can't. Okay, here we go. And I would
like to run this demo application. So,
this is the end result. But the one that
we have, I'll just say open with live
server. It should be right here. Here we
go. Now, I got some warnings because I
am already running the demo application,
but that's fine. Now, we don't have any
content at the moment, but let's go
ahead and get started with it. The first
thing we would like to put is this H1
that says quiz time. So, right inside
this start screen, I'll have an H1 where
I'll say
quiz time and exclamation point. Right
after this, we'll say P tag and we can
put this text. Let me copy and paste. We
can type this out. And this should be
the output. We're going to add styling
just to make it nice. And finally, we'll
have a button. Let's say
start quiz. And this will take an ID.
Let's say start
btn. Okay. Now, let's build the other
screen, which is the quiz screen. Right.
I'd like to maybe just shrink this a
little bit
more. Okay. So this is the one that
we're going to build for the quiz
screen. Let's say class of screen and
we'll say id will be quiz dash screen.
Let's put let's put the markup. So I'll
have a div. This will be the quiz header
that we have. I'll say
class quiz dash header and we'll say
it'll have an h2 that will have an ID.
Let's say question text and we'll say
question goes here. So we can put really
anything here because we will update
this. We will update this value whenever
we got a next question. Right? As you
can tell this will be updated with
JavaScript. Here we can see every single
time this will be something else. So
I'll just say question goes here and
then we'll go ahead say div. that will
get the quiz info. So I'll say class
quiz dash info and then we can put
something like
pag will say question. So this is the
part that we are trying to build we'll
say question and now as you can imagine
this part is dynamic. So when you select
something it'll be updated. So we would
like to have this as a span so that we
can have an ID. I'll say current dash
question and at the beginning it'll be
one but we will be updating it whenever
we go to the next question. Right? So
for now we'll just start with one and
then we'll say if um span. So once again
we'll have another span because we will
say
questions.length. Maybe in your code you
will add 10 different questions. So this
will be dynamic depending on the length
of the questions list, right? Depending
on the array. So for now just follow
along with me. I promise everything will
make sense once we just move forward
with this project. All right, I can show
you the entire screen. I'll just zoom
out so that you can see everything in
one line. Right after this P tag, we're
going to put our score. Right? So I'll
say give a little bit space one more P
tag and I'll say score. Now this part
once again will be dynamic right. So
we'll say span uh initially it'll be
zero and to be able to select it from
our JavaScript code we'll say ID of
score. All right. So this is what we'll
have for this span. So I would like to
save my code. Right after the quiz
header I'd like to put an answer
container. So this is that container.
Here we can see we have a bunch of
different answers and we don't really
know what are going to be the answers
because if you take a look at it
whenever the question changes we got
different answers right so this will be
dynamic coming from our JavaScript code
that's why we're going to leave the
content empty so let's see what I mean
we'll have a div let me zoom in so we
have the div we'll say ID of let's say
answers container and this We'll take
the class name of the exact same thing.
Let's say answers container. So we'll
use the class to give some styling and
we'll use the ID to be able to select
that query selector. Right now I'll just
put a comment here. I'll say answer
buttons will be
inserted here from our JavaScript code
later at some
point. Okay. So this is what we're going
to have for the answers container just
an empty div. Then we can put the
progress bar. I'll say div. Let's say
class of
progress dashbar and we'll go within
this div. We'll have one more div with
the let's say id of progress and class
of progress. Just like that the content
will be empty. we will calculate it
depending on where we are. Right? Okay.
Now, let's save. This is what we'll
have. And finally, we're going to have
the result screen, right? Let me just
pretty quickly complete
this. Okay. So, this is the result
screen that we're going to have uh right
after the progress bar as well as this
div which is our container for the quiz
screen. Right? We'll have one more
screen. Let's say div. This is the very
last one. And we'll say ID will be
result dash screen. And at the beginning
of this tutorial, I said we're going to
have two screens, but my bad. Turns out
we are going to have three different
screens. The quiz screen, result screen,
as well as the start screen, right?
Okay. Once again, my bad. Let me just
zoom in. This will have the class name
of screen as well. And if you say active
on this one, which is what we're going
to be doing once we complete the
project, this is what you would see. But
initially, this will not be the active.
Then we can have an H1. Let's say quiz
results. Then we're going to have this
text, this one, and then the button.
I'll just say
div name of result dash info. We'll have
a p tag. Let's
say you scored NP span because this will
be dynamic. Let's say initially it'll be
zero. And then ID of final score within
this P tag but outside of the span we'll
say out
of zoom out so that you can see it
clearly. We'll put another span. Let's
say this will take the id of maximum
score and we can say something like five
and right after this p tag we would like
to put the result message. So I'll just
say dev let's take the ID of result dash
message and for now we can say something
like good job but depending on your
performance you'll see something else
right and we're going to put this in our
JavaScript code I'll say good job then
finally I think that's it uh the only
thing we left is this button so right
after this result message and this div
which is the result info just go outside
and say button
id of restart
btn and we'll say restart
quiz. Okay, so believe it or not this is
the entire markup that we need to put
that we need to have. Now we'll just
jump into the CSS file and get started
with the styling. So I'll just visit the
CSS file that we have and let's get
started with the basic reset. So I'll
say basic reset that we're going to have
in almost every single project. So the
first thing I would like to do just say
asterisk and then say margin of zero on
every single element. Same thing for the
petting and then finally and the most
important one is the box sizing of
border box. So I I assume that everyone
knows this but just in case some of you
guys don't know this, I'd like to
explain pretty quickly. If you know this
property, you can just skip couple of
seconds or even minutes. Okay. So, I
just have a diagram that we're going to
go through and this is the end result
screenshots that if you wanted to have
the link of this diagram will be in the
description. Okay. Now, let's take a
look at the box sizing of border box.
So, what this does in the first place,
it changes how the browser calculates an
element's total width and height. Now
what happens if you don't use this
right? So let's say you don't have this
in your code. Okay, this is what'll
happen. Let's say you would like to have
a div with 100 pixels wide but you have
added some paddings such as 10 pixels
horizontally from the left hand side and
right hand side. Now what'll happen is
this browser will say all right you
wanted to have 100 pixels but now you
have added 10 pixels from the right and
from the left. Okay so we got 10 and 10
more. Now in total we
have 120 pixels which is something that
we don't really want. At first we said,
"Hey dude, we want 100 pixels wide." But
now we have 120 pixels, which is
something that is unexpected and that we
don't really want and need, right? What
we want is this one. We would like to
say, okay, let's go ahead use the box
sizing of border box. So this is the
example. If you use it, I'd like to just
copy this or maybe do Ctrl Z a
bit. Okay, so this is what will happen.
We have 100 pixels wide and we would
like to add some paddings from the right
hand side and left hand side. They will
be added. So we got petting from the
right and left. They're equal to 10
pixels. Now the rest is going to be 80
pixels because in total we have 100
pixels. And now if you take a look at
this at the end of the day you still
have 100 pixels wide div. And this is
something that you would like to have
99% of the time. Trust me, you don't
really ever want to have the other case
where width changes because just imagine
you came here in your code, right? You
said I want this div to be width of 100
pixels and you write some more CSS
properties and then you said all right
padding is going to be let's
say 20 pixels and then now the width has
changed because you didn't use this
property and this is something really
really common if you like if you have
ever got unexpected results you would
know that it is because of this
property. I hope that makes sense. At
the beginning, it kind of feels
complicated, but at the end of the day,
it just changes how the browser
calculates an element's total width and
height. All right, so I'll just leave
the example here. You can watch this
again if you don't really understand it
or you can do some quick research. Just
try to play around with it until it
makes sense. Okay, now with this in
mind, let's move on with our styling.
This is something that I wanted to
explain just just before we continue
because this is the most important thing
I think. Let's say body we're going to
put the background color. This will be a
custom color like F5
EF6 just like this one. And then we can
say display of flex we'll say justify
content center. And notice how I am
using shortcuts. So I'll just say J CC
and it should be completed. Same for the
item uh let's say align item centers or
center I should say a C. Then we can say
minimum height of 100 VH and we can put
the end result just next to
it. Okay. So this is what we have at the
moment. Let's say we would like to add
padding from all directions of one rem.
And then let's change the font family to
be sans serif. Let's save. This is what
we got. Now we would like to update our
container. I'll go ahead select this one
and I'll say background
color of let's say white. This is going
to be for the container. We can add some
border
radiuses. Let's say one ram. And then we
can give some box shadow. I'll say zero.
We'll say 10 pixels. 30 pixels. And then
we can add an RGBA color. Let's say
zero. And it'll be basically black. But
we're going to change the alpha value.
So I'll just say 0.1, which stands for
0.1. If you wanted to, you can um change
this. Let's say like
0.7. It is a lot more dark, but I think
it doesn't really look nice. This one is
a lot better. It is just subtle, but if
you wanted to, you can update it. Then
we can say something like width of 100%
but the maximum width will be 600
pixels. Just like that. And then we'll
say overflow of hidden. Finally we'll
say position relative. All right. Now
we'll go ahead and just build our
screens. We'll put some comments. Let's
say screens. We'll have the screen class
that will be display of
none for all of them because we will add
the active just in a second. Let's say
petting of 2mm and then text align of
center. Now everything will be
disappear. Let's let's comment this.
Okay, this is what we're going to have
only if only if we have the active
class. So we'll say if screen has the
active class we'll say display of
block here we can see and if you take a
look at the HTML code we have the active
class let's see we have the active class
on start screen if you cut it from here
and put it onto the quiz
screen here we can see now this is
active so I hope that makes sense but
initially the start screen should be
active and by the way I have in
additional folder. It's because uh I am
running the end result as well as this
demo application. They are both on a
different port. VS Code just added this.
If you don't have it, it's not really
important. It is just a configuration
file that I'll delete at the end of the
section. All right. Now, let's go into
the CSS file and keep building our
styles here. I'll go ahead and just add
the start
screen. Okay, I'll select this start
screen. Let's go ahead select the ID.
I'll say H1 and we can say color of
let's say
E86 A33 and I'll say margin bottom of 20
pixels. Then we can say font size of
2.5mm. Okay, let's see if this is what
we got.
This should be active on the start
screen. Okay, I have a typo. That's why
it did not work. Here we go. Now it has
been updated. Now let's move on. I'll
just go at the very bottom. I'll have
the quiz screen. So I'll say dot
quiz-ash header. You'll say it'll be
margin bottom of 30 pixels or you can go
with two twom. It should be the similar
values. And then we'll say question dash
text. We can add some more styling to
the colors like 333. And then we'll say
font size of 1.5 RM. Let's say margin
bottom of 1 RM. And finally line height.
Let's just increase it by 1.4. And then
we can say update the quiz info. I'll
say quiz-ash info. We'll go ahead say
display flex. And you can always take a
look at the end result just by going in
into the
diagrams. Okay, so we're going to be
building the quiz info which is this
part I believe. Right, we have something
on the left, something on the right,
etc. And we'll say display flex. Let's
say justify content. Now it's going to
be not center but instead space between
because we have something on the right.
I mean something on the left and
something on the right. So they should
be space between. We'll say space
between. Let's give the color of 6 six6.
Then finally we'll say font size of
1mm. Do we really need it? I think we
don't really need this. By default it is
1M. And finally we'll just say margin
bottom of something like 10 pixels. All
right let's save. And then we'll go
ahead update the answers container.
[Music]
Okay. So right here I'll I'll have
display of flex but this time it'll be
flex direction of column because as we
can see we have something at at the top
right and then it is just going in the
column direction. Then we'll go ahead
say gap of 10
pixels. Finally margin bottom of 25
pixels let's say. Then we can put the
answer button. So every single one of
these that you see, let me change the
color pretty
quickly. So this is an answer button.
This is an answer button, right? Every
one of them is an answer button. So
let's go ahead and build it. I'll say
dot
answer dash btn. This is the class that
we had. Now we'll just say background
color of this custom color F8 F0 and E5.
Then we'll go ahead update the color
itself. Let's say it'll be 333. Then
let's update the border. I'll say 2
pixels in the
solid and color of E A D
BC8. All right, we'll go ahead say
border radius. Here we can see they have
some rounded corners. So we can say 10
pixels. And then we'll give some
padding. Let's say just one ram. And
then font size. I'm sorry. Let's say
cursor will be pointer. Then we can say
something like text align left. And when
we hover over this, we want the color
change. So I'll go ahead to say restart
the quiz. Here we can see the background
changes. So we can say something like
answer btn hover and we'll say
uh let's say background color will be
updated to this value. I'll say e a d bc
but it'll be eight this time and then
we'll say border color will also be
updated. We can say border
color this will be d a c 0 a e. And
let's actually take a look at what we
have. So currently we cannot see that
part because we don't really have the
answers, right? We don't really have
anything in the markup. This would be
inserted. So we cannot really test it
out. But we can take a look at the end
result. And I want this transition to be
like smooth. As you can tell right here,
it just slides the uh slowly fades in.
So we can go ahead and add it right
here. I'll say transition will be on
everything. Let's say all and it'll be
0 3 seconds. And we can say say the is
function. Okay. Then we can change the
correct and incorrect styles. I'll go
ahead say answer button dot correct. So
if it is correct, we're going to get
this green
feedback. I'll say background color.
It'll
be this one
E6 FF and zero. So it is kind of like
greenish color. And then we'll have
border color. It'll be something
different like A 3F 0 C4. Finally the
color itself. It'll be 28
A745. Now let's duplicate this.
Basically I'll select everything.
Duplicate this. But this time it'll be
incorrect. And for the colors, please
feel free to go ahead pause the video,
type this out. This is what I'll be
doing. Just copy and paste. And then we
can move forward with the progress bar.
Here I'll go ahead say select the
class and we can give it a height like
10 pixels. Then we can say background
color of let's say F8, F0 and E5.
And this should have the hash at the
beginning. Then we'll say border radius
of 5 pixels. It is just a little bit
subtle as you can tell. Then we'll say
overflow of hidden. Finally, we can give
some margin top of something like let's
say 20 pixels. And then we'll just get
the progress itself. So one of them is
the container, right? This is the
container and this is the progress
itself. I hope that makes sense. We'll
say the height will be 100%. So it'll
just fill the container. Then we can say
background color will be something like
this value E8. Do we have it already?
Okay, it is this one. As you can tell,
we have used it previously in this
button and in the title here. I'll go
ahead say width of this. Initially,
it'll be 0%. Right? When you first start
the quiz, you don't really see it. It is
width of zero. And as we move forward,
as we select something, it'll just get
incremented dynamically from our
JavaScript code. Then we can add some
transition like transition will be
implemented on the
width. Let's say 0.3 seconds and ease.
You can give one of them, but I'll just
go with this one. Then we can finally
add the results screen, which is going
to look like this here. Let's go ahead
select that one. And maybe I can add a
comment like result
screen and just scroll a little bit to
give some space here. I'll just select
my uh let's say ID. I was going to say
class but it's an ID. We'll say result
dash screen and we'll select the H1. So
I'll give the color this classic color
that we have and then we'll say margin
bottom of 30 pixels. Then we can select
the result dash info here. I'll go ahead
say background color will be this value.
So it is f8 f0 e5 and we'll say border
radius of 10 pixels. We'll give padding
of 20 pixels and finally margin bottom
of 30 pixels. Then we can select the p
tag itself. Here I'll say result
info and p element. We'll say it'll have
the font size of
1.2 RM. We can give the color which is
going to be 333. And finally margin
bottom of one rim let's say. And then we
can select the result message itself
which is this one. Right? We got the P,
we got the H1. Now it is time to get the
result message itself. I will select it
with the ID. So this is the font size.
the font weight it'll be a bit bold
right and then the color itself now we
can change the button itself in general
right we can say just select the button
elements we'll say background color will
be the primary color that we have so far
then we can give the color itself to be
white and we can say border will be
none border radius will be 10 pixels so
that they are rounded and Then we can
say padding will be 15 pixels as well as
30 pixels. Then we can say font size of
1.1m. We'll just increment it a bit.
We'll say cursor will be
pointer just like this. And finally we
can add some transitions. So first I'll
save. Take a look at the end result.
This is what we have right. Uh when you
hover over this nothing happens. So we
can say
button on hover state. We're going to
change the background
color. It'll be D4
5 B as well as
28. But there is no any transition. So
we can go ahead add the transition on
the background color just like what we
have done previously. So now if you take
a look at it, there is a
transition. I think we are missing the
margin top or margin bottom from this
text. So let's see if I have a typo.
Then we can fix it. It should be in the
start screen. So we are just missing
this P tag margin bottom. And here is
where it comes from. I'll just add this
five lines of code. We selected the P
tag under the start screen. We added
some margin bottom and some other
styling like color and font size. Let's
save. Here we go. Now it has been
updated. And just before we jump into
the JavaScript file, what I'd like to do
just scroll to the very bottom and add
some media queries so that our
application is responsive. Let's take a
look at the end result. So I'll just try
to refresh my page and try to open up
the dev tools. So whenever we hit 500
pixels, just take a look at this. the UI
will just change a bit. So everything
will shrink as you can tell. Let's take
a look at the quiz screen once I hit 500
pixels. Everything just shrinks a bit so
that it is responsive and it is looking
nice in our mobile phone. So this is
what we'd like to do. Just update some
stuff whenever we hit 500 pixels and
below. So I'll just say responsive
design and we'll say add media. Then we
can say something like maximum width of
500 pixels. So this will basically tell
to the browser whenever we hit so let me
type when we hit 500 pixels and below go
ahead and just
implement the styles below. Okay. So, I
hope that makes
sense. Let's try to get started with it.
The first thing we would like to do just
maybe update the uh padding on the
screen. So, I'll just say we have the
screen. We would like to change the
petting to be something like let's see
what we had previously. I don't really
remember. Let's take a look at it. Okay.
So, padding is two rim. By default, it
is equal to 32 pixels. So we can
basically shrink this to health. So I'll
just say 1 RM right. Then we can change
the font size of the H1. So this say
start screen H1. It should be font size
of let's say 2M what it was at the
beginning. Did you update
it? Okay. So it was 2.5. Now we'll just
update it to two right twom and then
I'll add a couple of more things that is
not really hard that's just super simple
this is what I what I have added the
question text answer button and the
button itself now let's save and try to
see so this is our application when we
hit 500 pixels it just changes a bit
right
Okay, you can pause the video, change
anything that you wish, but these are
the values that I'll have. Now that we
have the styling as well as the markup,
we are ready to get started with the
JavaScript file. Now, before we write
anything here, we would like to link
this file from our index.html file. So,
just right above the body, I'll say
script and select this source option.
We'll just say script.js.
js. Okay, now this file is linked to our
website and that means we can go ahead
and get started with it. So the first
thing we would like to do select our
dome elements. So I'll go ahead add a
comment and we'll have bunch of
different selectors. Let's say the first
one will be start
screen that will be
document getelement by id and then the
id was start dash screen. I'll duplicate
this. We'll have another one. This will
be for quiz screen. I'll basically uh
select this part. Press command D or
control D. Let's say this is the quiz
screen. Now we'll have bunch of
different elements and if you don't want
to type them out, I have prepared a
GitHub gest that you can find. The link
will be in the description completely
free. Okay. So, this is what we have.
Just find the quiz project. MD and you
can copy this entire selectors. So I'll
get into this just in a second. For now,
this is what you need to copy and paste.
I'll basically delete everything and
paste this in. So we selected
everything. This will save us a lot of
time. We basically have the screens.
Let's say we have the button, the
question text, answer container, and all
the elements that we'll be using. And
then we're going to create an array of
quiz questions. So, as you can tell,
like I can copy and paste. No need to
type this out from
scratch. Okay, let's just paste this in
and I'll walk you through it. And also,
let's take a look at the end result. So,
we have five different questions, right?
First, we have an array that has five
different objects. They all has the same
fields. They have a question, which is
the question itself, right? And then a
list of answers. And each answer has a
text as well as if it is the correct
answer or not. So in this question the
Paris is the correct answer. Right? So
that's why we said this is true the
others are false. And depending on this
field we will give this kind of an uh
feedback. So I hope that makes sense.
You can add a lot more questions but for
now I'll keep it simple. Just have only
five different questions. Okay. Now we
can shrink this list and just scroll to
the bottom get started with our
variables. So I'll just say quiz state
bars and we'll have three different
variables. So I'll say let current
question index at the beginning once you
start the application you will start
from the very first question that's why
we will say zero and we'll say let score
which will be equal to zero at the
beginning and
answers disabled boolean which will be
equal to false. Now why do we have this
field? It's because let's say you click
to this answer and you immediately click
to it again. You don't really want the
score to be incremented, right? When you
first click to it, it'll be disabled
until we get the next question. I hope
that makes sense. Really important field
that we should have. And then we can now
uh like update our question and total
counters. So what do I mean? Let's say
total questions span. This is the
element that we just selected right
here. We will go ahead select this and
we'll say the text content will be equal
to quiz
questions.length. So this is what I have
explained previously. Let me go ahead
and save and if we say start quiz
nothing happens but we will just see
this in in a second. Now I'll also say
the maximum score span will be equal to
text content of quiz questions
dotlength. Okay, we'll just see these
two different lines what they do in a
second. Then we can add add our event
listeners. Let's say start button dot
add event listener. Right? Once we click
to it, we would like to do something
which will be the start quiz method.
Let's go ahead and create it. We'll say
function called start quiz. For now,
we'll just leave it empty. Or you know
what? Let's actually say console log
quiz
started. And let's duplicate this one.
And this time it'll be for the reset
restart button. Sorry. We'll say click
restart the
quiz. And this will be another function
that we'll just
build. So we can duplicate this one and
say restart
quiz. Okay, now let's open up the
terminal. I'll just click to this one.
Okay, what do we have? It says text
content. Where do we have? Do we have a
typo? Let's see. So I think we have some
kind of typo because one of these is
equal to undefined. So let's take a look
at this. It is called total questions.
I'd like to open up my index.html file.
Do I have any typo? Let's say total
questions. And looks like I don't even
have this field. Now let's see what are
we missing. So right here when we said
one of it should be five, but we'll add
this ID that says total questions. Okay,
just go ahead add this field. We forgot
to add that. But now we should be good
to go. I'll click to this button. It'll
say quiz started, right? Okay. Now that
we have the methods, we can I think just
start building them. So the first thing
we would like to do, let me first zoom
in. Once we start the quiz, we would
like to just reset our variables. So
here I'll say reset bars and we'll say
the current question index will be equal
to zero because we are just starting the
quiz. Score will be equal to zero. And
we will just update that
span. Let's say scores span dot text
content will be equal to the score
variable which is equal to zero. You can
also put zero like this but I think this
is yes let's actually do it here. I'll
just say
zero. Okay. Now let's move on. We will
say start
screen dotclass list dot remove the
active class because we just started the
quiz. We would like to make the quiz
screen to be active. Here I'll say go
ahead select the quiz screen and add a
class list of active. I'll just save and
test this out. I'll click to this one.
Here we can see now this is active. the
other one is not active. Okay. Then we
would like to say something like show
question. So we're going to show one
question at a time and we can put it
into this function. So let's copy the
name and create a function right
[Music]
here. Okay. Once again we are going to
reset the
state that will be answers disabled of
false because if we are going to show
the question we would like to not
disable the answers right here I'll go
ahead get the current question so we'll
say const
current question and we can say
something like quiz questions and we can
add our index which is the current
question index
We got the current question. Now we can
update the question number, right? Which
is going to be this part. So here I'll
say current question
span.ext content. We'll say whatever the
current question index is plus one
because this will start from zero. We
would like to say something like
one. Okay. So this is the very first
question. Instead of seeing zero, we'll
just add one. I know that we are going
really slowly but I just really want to
make sure that everyone understands
whatever we do. Okay. Then the next
thing is to update the progress bar. So
first we need to get a percent. I'll say
const progress percent. And let's try to
calculate it. I'll say current question
index divided by quiz questions dot
length. I'll just zoom out multiplied by
100. So this is the math that will give
you the percent correctly. Then we can
say progress
barstyle do width and we'll say whatever
the percent is. This is what we have
calculated. We'll say plus percent. Now
imagine this is what we're doing. Let's
say the percent is equal to 50. Now the
width will be 50%, so it'll be something
in middle right. This is exactly what we
are doing. Then we can update the
question text here. I'll go ahead to say
question text dot text content will be
equal to current
question.ext I'm sorry the question
itself because if you take a look at
this array we have the field which is
the question. It is this part right and
this is exactly what we are doing.
And after this, we can clear the
previous answer buttons. So I'll just
say
explain this in a second. Okay, I'll
even add a to-do right here. I'll show
you this what this does. But let's just
write the code for now. I'll say answer
container inner HTML will be equal to
nothing. Then we can create the answer
buttons. Right? So this is a button.
This is a button. So on and so forth.
What do we want to do? Basically go
through these questions. For every
single answer, right? Right. For this
answer, for this one, and all of these,
we would like to create buttons. So,
this is exactly what we'll be doing.
Let's go ahead and say current question
dot answers do for each for each
answer, we would like to run this method
where we would like to create a button.
So let's say const button document
dotcreateelement and maybe we should
zoom in. I don't really know. Let's zoom
in. Okay. We'll say create an element
that is called as button. Right? Then
we'll say button dot text content. We'll
add the
[Music]
answer.ext such as like Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, whatever that is. And then
we'll go ahead say button dotcl class
list dot add we would like to add this
answer button so that we can get the
styling and then one important thing we
need to add the correct property on the
button right so this is false this is
true and these are false how do we add
it if I click it how my code knows that
that was the correct answer well we can
use what we call a data set so here I'll
say button
data set dot
correct and you can call this anything
really like true but you know like
anything seriously but it should be
correct so that our code makes sense
right this is at least what I'd like to
call it and I'll say it is equal to
answer correct so either it is true or
false and only one of these buttons will
be equal to true and I'd like to put a
comment so I'll say what is data set.
Now, basically it is a property of the
button element that allows you to store
custom data. Okay, so you would like to
use a data set whenever you want to
store some custom data and this is
exactly what we are doing. We are adding
the true fields on a button. You can
call this you can use this on anything,
not only on the button. Uh but it is
something to keep in mind. And I'd like
to add a comment right here. It is
something that you would like to use
whenever you want to store some custom
data. Okay. Now that we have added this
field, we can add the click event into
the answer itself. So when we clicked
it, something will happen. So we'll say
button dot add event
listener which is going to be the click
event. We'll call the select answer
method. This is something that we'll
build. And finally we'll say add to
container. Let's say
um answer
container dotappend child add the
button. Now we have created the button
did bunch of different things on it but
we never add it to the UI. That's why we
need this line to add it into the UI.
All right. Now let's save. We need to
create this method. Let's just scroll
right above the restart function. I'll
create this one. added and just get
started with it. Now when you attach an
event listener by default it will get an
argument called event. So we can take
the event so that we know like so that
we can do a bunch of different things
and we're going to see what what that
is. Now as I said before when we click
to an when we click to an answer we
should check if the answer is disabled
or not. So we'll say if answer disabled
is equal to true, we'd like to just
return don't do anything. Otherwise, the
score would be incremented in a way that
that we don't really need. So now that
we check for it, this is something like
an
optimization optimization check really.
Then we can go ahead say answer
disabled will be equal to true because
we are just selecting an answer. and
we'll say get the selected button. So
I'll say const selected
button. Now how do we know which one we
clicked? Right? If I click to this one,
how do we know this is the one that we
clicked? This is how we can do. We'll
say
event.target. This will basically give
you the selected button. And we can say
const is correct. This will be a
boolean. And we'll say selected button
data set correct. If it is equal to
true, if this is the case, that means it
is correct. Now, notice how this and
this one is matching. So here, if you
said something like hello, you should
also say hello, right? They should
match. So once we got the variable, we
would like to do something. Let me
display. Now when we click to this one,
we are getting some kind of a feedback.
If you select the wrong answer, you get
another feedback. So we would like to
add a class that would update it and
this is exactly what we'll be doing. So
I'll say array from and I'll explain why
are we using it. Let's say
answers container dot
children. We'll basically convert this
into an array. I'll add a to-do. Explain
this in a second. Okay. Now that we got
all of them, we'll say for each every
single button just run this method.
We'll say if button dot data
set dot correct if it is equal to
true. In this case, we would like to say
button.class list dot add just add the
correct class. But else we would like to
add the incorrect class. So I'll go
ahead and just say add the incorrect
class. Let's save. Right after this we
would like to update the score if it is
correct. So we'll say if is correct go
ahead say score ++ which is equal to one
and we'll say scores span.ext content is
equal to score itself. Here we go. And
just before we move on with the next
question we would like to just wait a
second. Right here we can see we have 1
second of
delay right here and then we move on. So
this is what we'd like to do. And if you
want to add some delays, you would use
the set time out method which would take
a call back as well as the time out
which is going to be in milliseconds. So
let's say we would like to wait about 1
second. So let's put 1,00 milliseconds.
And then we say current question index
will be incremented. Then we'll say if
current question index is less than quiz
questions
dotlength. Now what are we doing here?
Let me add a comment. I'll say check if
there are more
questions or if the quiz is over because
if the quiz is over we are going to see
this screen but else we'll just show
another question. So if this is the case
that means we can show more questions.
I'll just say call the show question
method. What
else we'll just say show
results which is another method that we
need to create. So let's move on. We are
almost like we are near to complete this
file and I'll walk you through it from
start till the
end. Okay. So if we want to show the
results, we need to first hide the quiz
screen and show the results screen. So
this is what we'll be doing. Let's say
quiz screen.class list. You would like
to remove the active class and you would
like to duplicate this. This time you
would like to add the active class to
the result
screen just like this. Then we would
like to update the final
score text content to be the score
itself. Then we'll go ahead say so we
will say something like good effort or
you're genius or you're really bad
depending on the percentage right. So
here I'd like to say get the percentage
that will be equal to score divided by
quiz
questions.length multiplied by 100 100
and it'll say if this is equal to 100
then we can say something like uh
perfect you're a genius but we'll add
bunch of different else cases. So I'll
say else if and instead of typing them
out I just paste it. Here we can see we
have else if of 80% and above great job
here 60 and above good effort all the
way down to 40 and below. We'll just say
keep studying. So this is really basic.
That's why I didn't want to type this
out. Let's leave the restart quiz
functionality or let's just build it.
It's really really simple. Then we'll
just test out our application here. Here
I'll go ahead say something like result
screen dot classist dot remove. It will
just remove the active class. Then we
can say start the quiz itself because
we're just restarting it, right? Let's
save and give it a go. I'll refresh my
page and say start the quiz. Here we go.
Let's put the correct
answer. This is what we got. We can say
something like again correct answer add
the wrong answer this time. And there is
one thing that is different from the end
result. So if we select the correct
answer the wrong ones are also
displayed. So we can fix it by scrolling
to the top where we have this else case
here. I'll say else if the button is
equal to select a button only then we
would like to do this actually. Now,
let's save and give it a go. I'll put
the wrong answer. This is what we got.
We don't really see the wrong on all of
them. I think it just makes it a lot
more
cleaner. Let's put the wrong one. Okay.
So, I hope that makes sense. Now, we
have some to-dos. Just before we get
into it, let's complete the app,
complete the quiz. Okay, we can restart
it. Everything works as expected. Now,
let's take a look at the to-dos that we
have. So I will just go ahead delete
this for a second and try to run my
quiz. Give it an
answer. Now in the next run as you can
tell the previous answers did not got
removed right we got the new answers but
the previous ones are still here. So
that's why whenever we show the
questions we would like to first get rid
of the previous questions. So we say the
answer container will be equal to
nothing. Right? Just go ahead clear the
content. I hope that makes sense. That
was the very first to-do that we have.
Now I can delete this to-do and the
other to-do that we have. Let's just
search for it. Okay. So we need to
explain this array. Romero. Why do we
why do we need it in the first place?
Now the short explanation is this is not
an array. First we need to convert this
to an array so that we can use dot for
each method. But the longer answer is
let me try to explain by displaying it.
So I will copy this and whenever we
start our quiz I'll just say console log
this into the terminal. Okay let's open
up our terminal and just try to see this
in action. I'll say start the quiz. Now
as you can tell this is an HTML
collection and you cannot really say
something like children do for each.
I'll try to do it. I'll say, you know,
get the
element and say console log the element
itself. Right now, if you take a look at
it, we should get some errors because
you cannot really use the for each
method on it. But if you wrap this with
array
prompt just like this. Now this entire
thing is an array. You can use for each
on it. Let's save and take a look at it.
Here we can see even though we got
undefined but we didn't got any errors
that means it is
working. And this is exactly what we are
doing. So I'd like to put a comment
right here on this to-do. So I just
deleted that to-do comment and this is
what you're going to have instead in the
source code. And there is one thing that
we are missing just before we end this
section which is the progress bar. It's
because I am missing like I am having a
typo. This should be double s. So
progress just like this. Now if we save
hopefully it should be right here
working properly. And the other thing
that we have that is missing is the
score variable. Now it is working
correctly. But once we restart the game
it is going to crash. So notice how we
have three in this game. And if I say
restart quiz and go with this one now it
is four. Well, the reason is when we
said reset the variables here, I just
said we are going to have the score that
will be equal to zero. And then uh for
some reason I have deleted that. So I
don't know why I've done this but this
should be like this should be right here
so that when we start the quiz it will
be equal to zero. Now let's pretty
quickly go over this once
again. So we're going to have maybe
three points once again. But if we
restart the quiz and go with the correct
answer, it should be one, not four.
Right? So that's something to keep in
mind. And with this, I think we just
completed the entire project. Everything
is working as
expected. So with that, I'll see you in
the next project. In this section, we're
going to build a color palette
generator. And this is the end result.
Let's take a look at it how that works.
And then we'll just jump into the code
and build the actual application. So
when you first refresh the page, you
will get a different color palette that
you can copy either from the box itself
or with the copy button. And then you
can generate a new palette like as much
as you want. Every time you will get
different colors. So with this in mind,
let's go ahead and build our actual
application. Okay. So once again, I have
an empty folder called color palette
generator and I have three empty file,
right? Three empty files. So let's get
started with the HTML. I'll get my
boiler plate and let's say color palette
generator as our title. And then we can
link our CSS file as well as the
JavaScript file at the very at the very
end of the body. Maybe we can say source
will be the script.js file. Okay. Now
we'll go ahead and just get started with
it. So the first thing I'd like to have
is this container right let's say
container which will be this white box
that we can see and then we'll just put
the generate button so we'll say button
let's give it an ID like generate
dashbtn and then we'll say generate
pallet okay now I'd like to have this
icon right this tab icon on the left
hand light and how can we put this? So
we're going to say something like let's
have an i element that will have a class
name of f a s f a we'll say sync alt.
But if you save and try to see the
output let's say open with live
server. We cannot see anything. It's
because we didn't import the tab icon.
Right? So let's go ahead get the URL.
I'll say
cdnjs from this website. We can search
for want
awesome. Okay, just go ahead copy the
link tag and then we can paste it right
here below to the title and we should be
able to get this button as you can tell.
Okay, now that we have the generate
button, we would like to go below to it
and we'll have another container. So
I'll say class um
pallet dash container and I think we
forgot to add the h1 that will be above
the button but still inside the
container. I'll go ahead and just say h1
that will have the actually no class
names we'll just say color
pallet generator. All right then we'll
go into the pallet container. we will
just build our boxes. So, as we can
tell, we have five different boxes,
right? So, let's try to build them. I'll
say color box
one. We'll have a div with the class
name of color dashbox. Then we'll go
within this div create another div with
the class name of color. This will not
have any content, but we'll say style
will be something like this. background
color of we can give the value so you
can choose any value that you wish I'll
just go with this default value let's
say E1
F5 FE okay so this is what we're going
to have for the very first color but we
will be updating this whenever we say
generate a new palette so this will be a
little bit later in the video and then
we'll say let's create another div that
will have a class of let's say color
dash info. Then we'll go ahead create a
span that will hold the hex value and
then an icon for the copy button. So
this span will say this exact same value
but uppercased. So I'll say E1
F5
FE and let's give it a class. I'll say
hex dash
value. And now let's try to put this
button which is going to be an i element
class of f a r f a copy and we'll say
uh just class name of copy button let's
say copy btn okay now let's save take a
look at the output this is what we got
this is the actual icon that we just
used right okay and we can even add a
title so when you hover over this let's
say title It'll say copy to
clipboard. So this title will give
something like this. Let me hover over
that. Okay. So this is the title. This
is that property that allows us to see
that text. Now basically we're going to
do the same thing four times. Right? At
the end of the day we will have five
different color boxes. So this is the
very first one. I'll just try to
maximize this screen and and just put uh
four different color boxes. So here is
what I have just added the exact same
thing but we have just changed the
background color as well as the color
itself in the hex value. So this is the
second one that you can copy from the
source code or just type this out. We
have the same thing for this one for the
uh you know the last two. And now we can
go into the CSS file and try to build
the UI because currently this looks
disgusting and feels like I have a typo
right here in this span especially for
the color box of one. Okay, this should
be okay. Just like that. Now we just get
rid of that span text. Now we can go
ahead and jump into the CSS file. So
I'll just kill this one. Once again I
have this extra folder. Maybe you have
it, you don't have it. It's not really
important. It just says we'll just
change your port because you have the
end result running on this port. So at
the end of the section, I will go ahead
and delete this folder. It's not really
important. Okay. Now we can just get
started with our CSS file. So the first
thing I'd like to add will be the basic
reset where we'd like to select every
single element and say margin of zero
and duplicate this. Do the same thing
for padding. And finally, it'll say box
sizing of border box. Now, one thing
that I'd like to do is to update the
font family in my entire document. Now,
the classic way of doing it, I'll show
you a better way. So, this is the
classic way of doing it. You would just
visit Google fonts, right? Let's say
Google fonts. And then you would search
for a font family. Let's say this robot
robboto. How do we pronounce it? I don't
know. So, we got this one. Then you
would say get the font get the embed
code and you would either get the link
uh copy or the import copy. So for the
CSS right let's say you would copy this
and come back here add this then you can
use it in your entire document. So you
can say font family will be the one that
we just uh installed. Now let's save
it'll update the UI. Now you can install
this without visiting the website. So
you can do it from your VS code. The
first thing you would like to do just
install an extension called
Googles. Okay. So go ahead and install
it. Once you have done this, you can
basically Oops. Let's just delete this
part. You can basically say
commandshiftp or control shiftp. Then
you can search for Google fonts. And if
you wanted to add it into your CSS file,
you would select this one and then you
would search for the font. So whatever
that is in our case, let's say it is
Robboto. Here we go. We got the entire
URL that we can
save and we're going to have the exact
same result. So without this, it would
not work. Just notice how the font
family has changed. But if I add this,
now we're using the Robboto. Right now,
I'd like to actually change this. Let's
go ahead get something else. I'll say
I'll get
Poppins. Okay. Then we'll update this
part. Now it is just changed a little
bit more. And if this is not available
for some reason, if we cannot load it,
we can just fall back this with sans
serif. So this is one trick that you can
keep in mind. And if you're if you're
going to add it into the
index.html, you can do it in the exact
same way. So just under your hat
element, right? So you can say command
shiftp Google fonts but this time insert
link let's say robboto. So this is what
we got as a link import. I'll just
delete that because we have it in the
style.css file. So I hope this is a
useful trick that you have just learned.
Now let's go ahead and update our
background color for the body which will
be a linear gradient. So we'll go from
this color to this one from left to
right. So I'll just say body. The first
thing I'd like to do just say background
and we'll say linear dash gradient. We
can say to right or what I'll be doing
is to say 135°.
We'll say go from this color which will
be 83 A uh 8 D and F. Okay. From this
one to
C3 C F E2. Okay. Then we'll just say
minimum height of 100 VH. So it'll take
the entire screen. We'll say display
flex align item centered and justify
content of center. Then we'll say
petting of let's say 20
pixels. So this is the output that we
got. Now we would like to select the
container and we'll say the background
color will be white. We'll say border
radius will be 1 ram which is equal to
16 pixels. Then we can add the padding
of 2 ram. I'll say width of 100%.
And the maximum width will be 800
pixels. Let's save. This is what we got.
And I'd like to add some box shadow just
tiny bit. So I'll say 0 to 10 pixels, 20
pixels. And my color, which is going to
be
black, but we'll just change the alpha
color to 0.1. It's really really subtle,
but if you would like to increase it,
you can definitely do so. Let's just
actually go with this one. Then after
the container, we can select our H1 and
say text align of
center. And then we'll say margin bottom
of 1.5 ram. And we can maybe just zoom
out a little bit. Okay, so this is the
normal level that we should have. And
then I'll say color of 333. I'll say
position will be relative. You will see
why. And finally we can say something
like petting bottom of 0.5 ram. Okay.
Now we'll be using position relative
because I will create an H1 after
element. We'll be using this after zero
element to be able to add this
underline. And this will be positioned
absolutely right below to this text. Now
let's see how we can make that work.
Basically, we'll go ahead and just say
position this absolutely. And then we'll
say bottom will be zero. But we would
like to position this in the middle.
Right? So we're going to say take it
from the left of 50% and we would like
to take it back with transform of
translate x of minus 50%. So this is
that trick that we are using so that it
is being centered correctly and we'll
say the width of this could be 50%, you
can use any value like I'll display I'll
show this what this does in a second.
Then we'll say height could be 3 pixels.
So this is what we have three pixels on
the height and we'll say background
color could be this one. Let's say
66 7 E N A. Okay, then we'll say just
add a border radius of 2 pixels. Now
let's save. Probably we're not going to
see anything. It's because if you're
using the pseudo element, you have to
have the content property, right? I'll
just add the content. Even though it
doesn't have anything, we are able to
see it. Now, if you say width will be
10%. This is what'll happen. If you say
100%, it'll be the entire H1 element.
But I specifically want to go with 50%.
And if you do not add this part, it's
not going to be centered correctly,
right? Because when you say a left of
50%, it'll go from the left 50% but it
would be the starter starter point. So
what you would like to do just take this
50% to the back. I hope that makes
sense. Now this is working properly. And
then we can now update the generate
button. So I'll just scroll to the
scroll to right after this and I'll say
select the generate dashbtn. So I'll go
ahead and say background. This is going
to be a linear gradient from 45° from
this color to this one. So this is what
we got as the output. I'll just say the
text color will be white. We can say the
border will be none. Let's save. This is
what we got. Now we would like to say
petting from top and bottom 08 ram and
from left and right 1.5 ram. So this is
exactly what we got. Now we would like
to say border radius of something like
50 pixels. And then we'll say cursor
will be
pointer. We'll say font size or I'm
sorry font weight. Let's
say will be 600. So it's a bit more
bold. Maybe we can go with 500. Okay,
this is a lot more cleaner. Then we can
say margin bottom of
2mm. Here we go. And maybe we can update
the font size like let's say
1.1m. How it'll look like? How about 1
RM? Okay. So, we can definitely go with
one, which is a lot more cleaner, right?
Then we'll just go ahead update the
hover state. So I'd like to say
generate dashbtn on hover state. We
would like to basically
uh translate this to the up direction.
Right? So I'll just say
transform translate y minus 2
pixels. Now let's see if I hover over
this it'll just go minus 2 pixels above.
So let's say minus 20 pixels. It would
be a little bit too much,
right? Okay. And if you want this to go
below, you would just say two
pixels. Okay. I'll go with two pixels
minus 2 pixels. And we can give a bit of
box shadow on the hover state like 0 6
pixels 10 pixels. And then our color,
this will be a little bit different.
Let's say
RGBA
102, 126, 234, and let's say
0.3. Okay. So, as you can tell, it looks
really, really clean. Now, when we click
to it, it should go to the previous
state. And we can do this with the
active state. I'll copy this, paste
this, but it'll be active.
So we'll basically say transform will be
translate Y of 0 pixels or just zero.
Right? So when you hover over this, it
goes up. If you click to it, it'll just
go back to the previous state. And after
this one, we would like to add the
pallet
container. Let's select it and I'll say
display of grid. This time we'll say
let's give it a gap of 1 RM. So
basically this is what we would like to
have just a little bit of gap gap in
between and for the size we will say
grid template columns we'll say repeat
this. So the first option will be
auto-ash fit and we'll say minimum and
maximum we'll basically say in minimum
it could be 130 pixels and maximum it
will be just one
fraction. Okay. Now, if you take a look
at it, it'll be
responsive. And we'll just even make it
look cleaner. Let's go ahead select the
color box. I'll say this will have the
border radius of 10 pixels. This will
have the overflow of hidden. And we'll
say give a bit of box shadow. And I can
just copy and paste this value. This
will be let's say
0.01. So that looks a little bit subtle.
Then we can say the
transition will be
transform of 0.2 seconds. Then we can
select the color box hover
state. And let's go ahead say on the
transform we'll say translate Y of - 5
pixels. So that we could have this exact
same output. Right? When you hover over
this, it goes five pixels above. Okay.
Right after this color box, we'll just
say the color
itself. This is another element that we
have. Let's say height will be 120
pixels. Here we go. And we can say the
cursor will be pointer. Okay. Now we can
go ahead select the color dash info
element and it'll say background color
will be white. We can go ahead add some
paddings. Let's say 0.7
RM. Save. Here we go. We'll say display
of flex. So that we can say align items
of centered and justify content space
between so they would be spaced
out. And maybe we can say font size of
0.9 RM. I'll also go ahead select the
hex value and I'll say font weight will
be 500 and the letter spacing could be
0.5 pixels so that it looks a little bit
more clean and then we can get the copy
button. So I'll just say
dotcopy
dashbtn let's say cursor will be pointer
just like every single button we can say
color will be this specific one I'll go
with
64748b okay this is what we got now we'd
like to just add a little bit of
transition because in the copy button
hover
state let's first add this one we'll say
color will change output that's going to
be equal to this one. Let's say now if
you hover over this it'll just happen
instantly. So we can say
transition transition the color property
with 0.2
seconds. Okay. So it's just a little bit
more subtle. And then finally we can
make this a little bit more let's say
responsive. I'll go ahead add my media
query. I'll say max
width of six sorry 768
pixels. We would like to say pallet
container and we'll just update the grid
template columns. Let's say
repeat here we'll say auto fit but we
would like to change the minmax function
with 100 pixels to one
fraction. Here we can see once you
hit 600 sorry let's just take a look at
it once you hit this break point which
is 786 pixels notice how from here once
you hit
that so it is right here once you hit
that it'll just change a bit so that it
is responsive and it's working correctly
in the mobile phones as well okay so
with that that's going to bit for the
CSS styling now we can go ahead and jump
into the JavaScript file where we can
generate the pallet and copy the values.
So let's go ahead close this file and
open up the script.js and the very first
thing we would like to do select our DOM
elements. So I'll say const let's get
the generate button and I'll say
document getelement by ID and let's put
the ID which was a generate dash btn.
Now I'd like to duplicate this. I was
going to say but let's actually type
this out. I'll say pallet container.
We're going to select this one as well.
That will be document query selector
this time because we're going to select
it with the class. So say pallet dash
container. This is what we have in our
code. Now we'll go ahead and just add an
event listener. Right? I'll say generate
button dot add event listener of click
event. In this case, we would like to
call our method called generate pallet.
And let's create this method or the
function, right? We say function
generate pallet and just leave it as an
empty function for now. Now, the other
thing that we would like to do whenever
we refresh our page, we would like to
have another pallet, right? So I'll just
go ahead
say as soon as we visit this page just
go ahead call this method. Now if you
don't want to you can delete this part
really it's not needed because by
default we have a pallet. Okay so just
in case if you want to get a different
pallet on refresh you can basically add
this
one. Okay, for now we'll I'll just keep
this right here and then we can move on
with this method called generate
palette. So in this method we'll have a
colors array that will be empty
initially. Then we'll go ahead create
five random colors and then we'll just
push it into this array. We'll say four
let i starts from zero all the way up to
five so that we can just run this five
times. And then in this case, we'd like
to say
colors.push. And we'll say generate a
random color, which is going to be the
method that we're going to build right
now. Generate random color. Now, in this
function, we're going to have a constant
called letters. And this will start from
zero all the way up to 16. So, we'll go
like from 1 to 9. But then we'll say a b
c d e f. So this is up until 9 and then
10 11 because this is how it works if
you want to create colors with hex
values. Right? As you can tell we have
letters from a to f. Okay. So once you
have this in mind we can say let will
create a color.
Basically the first value always will be
this hash and on top of it we'll add
some random values such as this one or
this one or any kind of value that you
can imagine. So I'll say for let I is
equal to zero and we're going to run
this six times because if you have
realized we have six letters every
single time right just take a look at
that this is what we have and we'll say
while I is less than six we'll just go
ahead and increment it by one and now
we'll say go ahead add on top of the
color variable we'll say letters and we
would like to basically select one of
them randomly, right? So, we would like
to add an index and I'll say math do
floor
math dot random and we're going to
multiply this by
16. Okay. Now, I'd like to show you this
what this does. Let's copy it. Open up
the terminal. I'll basically paste this
every single time. So, now we got 1 six.
As you can tell, we are getting random
values from zero all the way up to 15.
Now 16 is not included because we only
have 16 elements but indexes are
starting from zero, right? So if we have
to put the
indices okay this is kind of annoying
but this is the index of 0 one. Okay,
why do I even type? So 0 1 all the way
up to 15. So that's why this will never
give you the value of 16. At maximum
this could be 15. So this is something I
wanted to highlight. And after this for
loop we would like to basically say
return the color. So it would be
returned right and then this would be
pushed into the array. Now, if you would
like to test this out, you can copy this
function, put it into your terminal, and
just call that method, which is called
which is called the generate random
color. Just go ahead call that. So,
every single time we'll get a different
randomly generated color as you can
tell. Now, we got the color. What do we
want to do? So, we got six different So,
we got five different colors. We would
like to take them and update the UI with
it. We'll say
update
[Music]
pallet display and this is going to be a
method where we'll just pass the colors
right so we have generated some colors
and we will pass it into this method so
that it can update the UI with them now
let's go ahead and create this method
let's say function we'll get the colors
and we'll do something with it so the
first thing we would like to do just
select all the color boxes
I'll go ahead say const color boxes and
say document doquery selector all where
we have this class name color dashbox
and we would like to loop through each
color box and update it with a color
from our array. So I'll say color boxes
dot for each method and we're going to
get every single box. Also I'd like to
get the index. So let's wrap this with
with brackets and I'll say index as
well. Let's run an arrow function here.
We would like to create sorry we would
like to get the color itself. So I'll
say
colors by using the index. So we can we
can get the color itself. We'll be doing
this for every single colors, right? And
then we'll say con let's say color dev.
We can say box query selector of
box. Sorry, what am I doing? So this
should be color. I'm sorry. Let's go
ahead duplicate this. Now we would like
to get the hex dash value. And we can
update this variable. We'll say h value.
Now we going to see why are we getting
those in the first place. The first
thing we would like to do is set the
background color of the div. I'll say
color
divy and we'll say
background color will be equal to this
color whatever we have and then we would
like to update the text to show the hex
value I'll say hex value dot text
content will be equal to color okay
let's save hopefully it should be
working out I'll say generate pallet as
you can tell we are just creating the
values, right? We are creating all these
colors and then we are updating our
palette. We're just going to get every
single colors, right? Then it will just
loop through it so that it can update
the UI. So I'll just click to it. These
colors have been generated and we have
updated the UI both the background color
as well as the text
itself. Okay. Now let's see what happens
if we refresh the page. So every single
time we're going to get a different
palette because whenever we visit our
page we are running this method. But if
you delete it every single time if you
refresh you're going to get the exact
same color palette. Maybe this is the
behavior that you would like to have. So
you can delete this line or if you would
like to get some random colors you could
add this one. I'll just go ahead and
comment this out so that we can have
this on every single refresh. Now the
other thing that we need to add is the
copy functionality. When I click to the
box or into this uh icon into this
button, it should copy it. Now we would
like to add an event listener for that
as well. So just because we have the
first event listener right here at the
top. I'll just go ahead add the second
one below it. So I'll just say pallet
container.ventlister which is going to
be the click event. We would like to run
this function. Now you can either go
with an arrow function like this or you
can go with a default anonymous function
in this way. So this is what I'll be
using. It's completely optional. I'll
get the event which is passed by
default. And I'll say if now we have two
different checks which is this one.
Either we click to the button itself or
into the box itself. Right? both of them
will copy both of them will copy the
value. So let's handle the first case
where the user click to the copy button.
So I'll say if
e.target doclass list. This is how we
can type this out. Class list
contains the
copy-bn. In this case we would like to
go ahead do something which is to first
get the hex value. I'll say get the hex
value. And how can we get this? So we'll
say e.target dot
previous element
sibling dot text content. Now now that
we got the hex value, we can copy it to
the clipboard. Now why are we saying
previous element sibling? Let's see why
this is the case. Now if we click to the
copy button, let's take a look at the
index html. Where do we have the copy
button? Let's search for it.
copy-bn. Okay. Now when we click to this
element, we would like to go to the
previous sibling which is this one. And
we would like to get the text content.
So this is exactly what we are doing. We
just got the text content. This is the
value. And we would like to copy this to
our clipboard. And how can we do so?
Well, you can say
navigator.clipipboard dot write text.
Then you can basically put the hex
value. Now let's save and take a look at
it. If I click to this button, now it
has been copied. But that was the end
result. Sorry. Let's go ahead and copy
this one. Now it's been copied. If you
paste it right here, as you can tell, it
is this value that has just been copied.
Now once the value is copied, we would
like to show some success feedback just
like this one. And this is working
asynchronously. So what does that mean?
We can add a method like 10 at the end
and we'll say once you have copied this
to the clipboard, go ahead run this
method which is to show copy
success. Okay. But if you got some
errors, we can handle it with the catch.
So right after this just chain catch
we're going to run this method where we
get the error itself. Let's say err and
you can say something like alert the
error or you can just put a console log
if you really wanted to just like this
one. Okay. Now we don't have this
method. We're going to be building it
right now. I'll maybe just shrink every
single one of these and create this
method called show copy success. So this
will be relatively simpler than you
think. What do we want to do? Just
basically display something and hide
something else. Right. Let's take a look
at the end result. We're going to
display this icon and hide it. Then show
this one. Once again, just before we get
into this function, I'd like to scroll
to the top and get the copy button with
this query selector because we'll be
using it in this method. So, the first
thing I'd like to do just say copy
button.class list dot remove this one.
Let's say f a r and fa dashcopy. Then we
would like to add another one. So that
will be f a s and f a
check and this should be
add. Then we would like to change the
color as well. So I'll say copy button
dotstyle dot color will be this green
one. So I'll say hash
48 doubleb 7 and it should be eight.
Let's save. Take a look at it in this
one. Okay. So for some reason this has
been updated. why this is the case. I'll
refresh. I'm clicking to this one or
this one, but the very first one has
been updated. So, this it is strange
that we're going to take a look at it. I
think it's because we didn't completed
the else if case. We'll get into it just
in a second. For now, let's move on with
this method. So, what do we want to do
once we copy it? After 1.5 seconds, we
would like to go back to the previous
state. And if you want to add some
delays, you can use set set time out
method with the callback as well as your
time. So I'll go with this value which
is equal to 1 second and half. I'll say
copy
button dot class list. Now we'll be
doing remove but this time we're going
to remove this
one. And I'll duplicate this. This will
be
add. So we are basically negating what
we have just done a couple of seconds
ago. I'll say copy button
style dot color will will be basically
nothing so that it can go into the
default color. Right? We're just reset
resetting it. Sorry. Now let's save and
get started with the else if case. And I
think it should be good to go. I'll say
else
if e.target.class
class list
contains the color and this means if
user clicked directly on a color box
right so in this case we would like to
run this block where I would like to get
the h value we say const h value this
will be e target the next element
sibling
[Music]
the query selector we would like to
select the hex dash value and I'll just
maximize this we'll say just get the
text content now why this is the case
why are we getting the next element
sibling let's take a look at it pretty
quickly under index html so if we click
to the color element which is this one
we would like to go to the next sibling
element which is this color info and
from here we would like to get the hex
value. So this is exactly what we are
doing. We are just getting the text
content and then we would like to do the
exact same thing that we have just done
right here. I'll copy this, paste it,
save. We're just basically copying it to
the
clipboard. Let's put them side by side.
Save this and take a look at the end
result. I'll say you know just copy this
one. But for some reason it is getting
the very first
one. Let me copy this and put it into
the URL. So we are copying this value
but this UI has been updated. Let's see
why this is the case. All right. So the
reason that this is happening is because
of this copy button. Now when you say
query selector of the copy button, we
have five different buttons, but it'll
always select the very first one. So
instead of actually saying copy button,
we would like to delete this and we
would like to make it dynamic. So
whichever we clicked, it should copy
that one. And for this we can send an
element to this method. So I'll say
e.target in this one. And right here we
will say e.target target. We would like
to find the copy button because this is
where we click to the box. Right? When
you click to the box, you would like to
select this element. So I'll say
e.target dot next element sibling query
selector and we'll say
dotcopy-bn. Once again, let me maximize
this. Here we go. This is what we got.
And in this
method, we would like to get the element
as an argument. Instead of using that
copy button, I'll just say command D
couple of times. I'll just say use that
element. Now it should be working out as
expected. If I try to copy this one,
it'll update it. And if I click to this
one, this one will update it. Everything
is working as expected,
right? Okay. So that was the entire
project. I just try to go really slowly.
I'm sorry if it is kind of boring, but I
just try to make sure that we understand
everything like the previous element
sibling, the next element, so on and so
forth. And we even made a mistake where
we got the copy button with the query
selector, but we just pretty quickly
fixed it where we need to pass the
actual copy button dynamically, right?
we have added the event target or the
copy button itself and then just handle
it in the from the method. Okay, so I
hope that makes sense. That's going to
do it for this project. I'll see you in
the next one. In this section, we're
going to build a simple canon board.
Now, if you have never heard of it, you
can basically check it out and you can
see a bunch of different examples, but
I'd like to walk you through it within
this example. So, we're going to have
three different lists such as the to-do
category, in progress, as well as done.
And you can take these cards and change
the category, right? So, I can take it,
put it into this list or this one, or
even in this one. And I can even order
them within the list itself. So, we have
a buy groceries at the top if I wanted
to. I can take it to the bottom. So,
this is the end result. This is what
we're going to be building. And there is
an API which is the HTML drag and drop
API. This is the documentation that you
can take a look like if you want to
learn everything about it. This is the
article that you would like to go
through. But basically I will simplify
it and I'll just teach you the 90% of
the things that you would need to get
started with it. So this is the end
result. This is what we're going to be
building. Let's go ahead and jump into
the code. I have an empty folder as
always with three different files. Let's
first get started with HTML. I'll just
put them side by side. And by the way,
the end result will be responsive as you
can tell. Well, it is it's maybe not
that responsive. I think here we cannot
scroll to the top, but we can fix it
within our code. And I just even went
pretty quickly fix the end result. So
here we can see it is responsive. we are
able to scroll to the top to the bottom
and we have our columns either like this
or one at a time. Okay, now let's go
ahead and have this index.html. Let's
open this up with the live server that
should be right
here and we can close these
warnings. Okay, so let's create our
file.
I'll say for the body we would like to
have couple of different divs. So I'll
just zoom in maybe and I'll say we would
like to have a div that will be our
container. So I'll say class name of
container. We'll go ahead have this h1
which will be the simple canbon board
text. So I'll go ahead paste this in and
then we're going to have the board
itself. So it'll be this container that
you can see. Oops. Okay. So it is this
one that we have. So we'll just call
this as a board. Let's
say
board just like that. And we'll go ahead
have some lists. So I'll just say create
a div with the list class. And this will
take the id of list one. And we are
going to duplicate this twice. But for
now let's say this is the list one. And
this will take the h2 which will be
to-do. So this is what we have just
built. And we're going to put two
different cards. So I'll say card class
that will have the wash
dishes. Now the most important thing
here it comes. It'll be dragable of
true. Now let's see what this
does. Um if I save, can I see anything
on this file? No, I
cannot. Okay, I just refreshed. Now we
we should be able to see it. Let's say
dishes with double s. Okay, now it is
working in live mode. Now what happens
if you say dragable of true? Well, first
let's delete it and try to see what
happens if I try to drag this and drop
it. I cannot, right? It is selectable.
I'll just zoom in. So we can select it,
but we cannot drag and drop it. But if
you say dragable of true, now we can
basically drag this and drop it any
places. But we don't really have the
functionality, so it is not going to
work. But we're going to make that work
just in a second. So this is that thing
that we need and you can take a look at
it from the documentation. It should be
somewhere right here.
Okay. So now that we have the dragable
of true now that we know what this does,
we'll go ahead add an ID. I'll say this
will be our very first card. I'll say
card one. And we can basically duplicate
this one. This will
be buy groceries, right? Let's type this
out. So, it'll be dragable of true, but
cart of two, right? We'll just update
the ID. So, that's going to be for our
very first list. Now, we'd like to add
the other ones such as in progress and
done. So, I have just zoomed out right
after the list one. We'll go ahead add
our list two which has the in progress
because this is what you have when you
refresh the page. You have one item here
and nothing on the done list. So this is
exactly what we have done. We have one
card in progress and nothing in the list
of three which is done. Okay. So that's
going to for the HTML file. Now we would
like to link our CSS file. I'll just say
link CSS which is the style. CSS file.
and let's say
canon port because why not and then we
would like to add the script source of
script.js js file and the very first
thing we would like to do is just build
the style CSS file. So as always we're
going to add our basic reset and this is
the end result that we have at the
moment. So I'll just say select
everything and we'll say padding of
zero. Let's duplicate that. This will be
margin of zero and finally box sizing of
border box. We'll go ahead select the
body. The first thing I'd like to do
update the font family. So I'll say font
family will be equal to let's say sans
serif. Now everything has been updated.
Then we'll say let's update the
background color. Instead of using white
I'll go with a kind of like a gray
color. I'll say
f8 f9 and fc. Then we'd like to say
display of flex justify content of
center and then align items of center.
Now we would like to say minimum height
of 100 VH and it'll take put everything
in into the middle of the screen. Then
we would like to select our container
and we would like to say text a line of
centered. Then we would like to say
width of 100%. And finally let's give
some paddings like
1.2 RM. Okay. Now this is what we have.
Let's go ahead select H1. We would like
to say color of the classic one that we
use. We'll say margin bottom of 20
pixels and font size of
twom. Okay. Then we would like to change
the board class. Right. I'll go ahead
select the board. Let's say display oops
display of flex justify content. Now
this will be space around and let me
display it in the end result so that
they are spaced out. uh let's say spaced
out evenly, right? Well, actually there
is something called space evenly, but
this is kind of similar. Not exactly,
but it'll do the similar thing,
right?
Okay. And then we would like to say
something like align items of
start actually flex start just like
this. And we'll say width of 100% but we
would like to give some maximum width
which is going to be 1200 pixels. And
then we can say margin of zero as well
as auto. And finally we'll just give
some gap like 20 pixels. All right. This
is what we got. Still looks ugly but
we're going to get there. I'll go ahead
say select the list. We'd like to say
background color will be updated to
something like E3, E4 and
E8. Then we'll say padding of let's say
1 RM. We can give a border radius of 8
pixels for the rounded corners. Width of
let's say 30%. So it is kind of
like like 30 30 and we have some spaces.
It'll be kind of like 100% in total.
Okay. Then we would like to say minimum
height. Let's just type this out. I'll
say minimum height will be 400
pixels. And then we can say let's just
give some box shadow. Right. I'll say
zero and 4 pixels 8 pixels. Then we'll
say rgba. Oops. If I can type correctly,
we'll say rgba. We'll go with zero.
Okay. Kind of annoying, but let's go
ahead type this out.
And for the color, you can go with
something like 0.4. But in this case,
I'll just go with 0.2. This should be
good to go. If you increase it, what
happens? Let's see our end result. Like
kind of ugly. So like 1.1 is even 0.2.
And then we can add something like list
H2. We would like to update the heading.
I'll say color of 555 and margin bottom
of 1mm. And we can just increase the
font size 1.5 RM. This is what we got.
Now we would like to select the card
itself. Let's say cart. We would like to
update the background color color and
bunch of different things. So let's just
say start with this one. This could be
white. Here we go. And we'll say color
will
be 333. And then padding will be let's
say 1m. Then we could say margin bottom
of 10 pixels. Now we have added the
margin bottom. Let's say border radius
of 8 pixels. Here we go. This is what we
got. We'll say cursor of grab. Now this
is kind of cool because once you hover
over this, it has a grab. And there is
also something called grabbing. when we
click to it, this is how it'll look.
So, let's actually try to see it. I'll
just say by default this will be grabb.
But if we say
cartactive, it should be cursor of
grabbing. Now, let's say this is grab
and this is grabbing. Pretty cool,
right? Then we would like to add one
more thing which is going to be box
shadow. I'll say zero two pixels four
pixels and the same exact color I'd like
to copy and paste. Now we would like to
add some transition. First let's say
here we'll have transform of scale that
will be 0 sorry 1.05 and box
shadow. We would like to just update it
a bit. I'll basically copy this entire
thing but duplicate it. I mean uh
increase it by two right I'll just say
this will be four pixels we'll basically
multiply it by two now let's say active
this is what happens but there is no
transition right it is happening
immediately and we can go ahead add it
by adding the transition field we'll say
uh implement for the transform with 0.2
2 seconds. And we can add a comma and we
can say box
shadow. This would be let's say box
shadow. This could also be 0.2 seconds.
Let's save. Now it's like a little bit
more smooth. I'll delete this just to
see like it is happening instantly. But
once we have it, it's a lot more
cleaner, right? And you can say
something like all as well. Now it'll
apply to everything but I just wanted to
show this if you want to add some spec
specific things sorry let's say for the
transform you want this to be in 2
seconds like as you can tell it is just
happening in 2 seconds which is kind of
ugly but this is just an extreme example
so I hope that makes sense and now that
we have understanded we can save and
move on with the next class I'll just
say list dot over if we have this over
class we would like to update the
background color to be let's say D1 D3
D8 now why do we need this over class
let me display if we go into the end
result so if you take it and put it
right here as you can tell the
background it changes right and this is
what we are doing once we drag I mean
once we enter into the container we will
add that class and once we are out we're
going to remove it I hope that makes
sense
Now let's go right here and finally just
make it a little bit more responsive.
I'll say at media. So I'll say media max
width 768 pixels. We would like to
change something which will be the
board. I'll say flex direction will be
column and we can say align items will
be centered in this case. Then finally
the list will be width of 80%. And
margin bottom of 20
pixels. Okay. Why does this looks that
ugly? Okay. This should be 80% not
pixels. Here we
go. Once you hit here, it's like
completely
responsive. So we have the entire UI. It
is working as expected but we don't
really have the functionality. We can
just drag and drop or we go to drag but
we cannot drop it. So for this we will
add the script.js file. So let's kill
the left hand side and get started with
it. And I think this will be easier than
you think. But let's go ahead and see
what we'll have. So the first thing I'd
like to do just select all the cards and
lists that we have in the UI. So I'll
say con cards and maybe duplicate this.
This will be lists and for the cards
we'll say document dotquery selector all
and I'll copy this name and then I'll
say just select the card class. Then
we'll go below we'll say document query
selector all this time we will select
all the lists. Now what do we want to do
first is to add some event listeners.
Now notice how we have things like in
the end result we have things like drag
is started drag is entered right so like
drag is entered drag is leave so on and
so forth so we'll add all kinds of
events that we would need for this
project so the first thing I'd like to
do is to create a for loop I'll say for
const card of cards basically we will
add an event listener for every single
card and we can do it with a for loop
I'll say cart do addevent listener and
we're going to listen for the drag
start. Okay, this is how we can type
this out. And once we have this event,
we can run our method where we will
handle this event. So I'll say drag
start. This is something that we will
create just in a second. Then we can say
cart add event listener for the
drag end event and we'll call our method
to implement it which is going to be
called as a drag end. And now we would
like to add some events for the lists.
Right? So we just added some events for
the cards but we would like to add some
events for the lists themselves. Right?
I'll say for and do the exact same
thing. const list of
lists and we'll add four different event
listeners. So I'll just say list add
event listener and I'll just duplicate
this three times. Here we will listen
for drag over. We will have drag enter.
We'll have drag leave and finally just
drop event. Now all of these events are
coming completely from the
documentation. You can double check but
I'd like to simplify it and walk you
through it within this project. Okay, so
we are listening for these events. We
would like to handle them within a
function. So I'll just say drag over for
this one. And we'll do the same thing
for drag enter and these last two. I'll
say drag leave and finally drag drop.
Now let's get started with the drag
start function. Let's create it. So here
is how I created it. And by default,
this will take an argument which is
going to be the event. So the first
thing we would like to do is this one.
We'll say e.at
transfer just like this. And we'll say
dot set data. Now this is exactly coming
from the documentation. Let's type this
out and then I'll explain what this
does. So we'll say
text /plane and we'll just say this do
ID. So this basically will set the ID
and I'll put a comment. This allows the
drop location to know which element is
being moved when you release it. So I
hope this makes sense. You can take a
look at the documentation. Let's just
search for text plane. So this is
exactly what we have I think at the at
the top. Okay. So this is what they are
doing. They say event.target
id. We are using this id. It is kind of
the similar thing. It is working in the
same way. Okay. Now let's go ahead and
complete this function. This is all we
need for it to handle the drag start.
Now we're going to add the drag end.
I'll say
function drag end. Now you can do
anything that you wish within this
function but for now I'll just say
console log drag ended. Now I'm not
implementing anything at the moment. So
just to see this event is actually
existed. This is why I am implementing
it right here. Right? So we got the
function. It's really really simple. And
now let's handle the drag over method.
Once again will be super simple. Let's
say function drag
over and we'll just take the event and
we'll say something like
event.prevent default. Now why do we
need this method? Why do we need to say
event.prevent default? So if we have to
explain it with a single sentence, this
is what it would be. This line is
important because by default browsers
don't allow you to drop elements onto
other elements. So this is exactly what
we are doing. we will just prevent the
default behavior. Now the other method
that we would like to implement is the
drag enter. If we take a look at the end
result as I said previously when we
enter into something we will just see
this different background color with the
help of this over
class. So this is what we have added
list dot over the background color will
change. So this is exactly that method
that we will handle. So let's say
function drag enter now right and we'll
take the event we'll say first let's
prevent the default it's the same reason
that we have above finally we'll just
say this class
list go ahead just add the over class
now if we save hopefully it should be
working as expected if I take this one
okay why this does not work maybe we
still didn't complete our code. That's
the reason. But let's see how it'll
happen. We just need to add one more
method or maybe even two. I'll say
function basically copy this, duplicate
it. This will be
drag over. And in this case, all we want
to do just remove the over class. And
one last function that will be drag
drop. So I definitely understand this
might be kind of complex or even
overwhelming but everything that you
have seen here are basically coming from
the documentation and personally I
didn't really memorize any of them. So
if you delete this entire line or if you
delete this entire file and ask me to do
it tomorrow again maybe I'll just forget
some part which is completely fine right
you don't need to memorize any of them
but just know like this is something
that has existed you can build your own
version or you can use even some
built-in packages so this is the point
of this project in the first place just
to make you aware that something like
this existed within HTML And this is how
we can build it pretty simply and
quickly. Okay, with this explanation out
of the way, let's go into the drag and
drop method and say give me the id of
the like ID of the element, right? I'll
just say const id. We'll say event dot
the exact same thing actually that we
have done above. I'll copy this part
event data transfer but this time we
will say get data and this part will be
the same which is text /plane then we
would like to go ahead just find the
card I'll say con card we can say
document getelement by id and just pass
the id within that and we'll say this
dot append
child because we are appending something
Right? If I take this one and drop it, I
just append this child into this parent.
So that's why we need to call this
method with the card itself. And
finally, we'll just say this class list
remove the
overass. So that should be it. Hopefully
everything should be working as
expected. Let's go ahead and test this
out. I'll refresh. Take this. Put it
right here. Looks like it doesn't. Maybe
we are missing something. Let's see why
this is the case. So if we take a look
at our terminal, we have an error that
says drag leave is not defined. That's
true because I forgot to call this as
drag leave. Okay, that should be it. Now
it should be working out as expected.
I'll take this one, put it right here.
This is what we got. And we can put it
on this one. This one. Everything is
working as expected. So that's going to
be it for this entire project. I hope
you enjoyed it. Once again, the point of
this project was to actually teach you
that there is something called HTML drag
and drop API. This is existed. This is
something that you can use whenever you
need it. Everything is coming from the
documentation. It is kind of
complicated, but you don't really need
to memorize the entire syntax. All you
have to do just come up to the
documentation, learn it or try to copy
and paste into your code. As long as it
is working, I think that's completely
fine. So with that, I'll see you in the
next
project. In this section, we're going to
build an expense tracker. Now, this is
the end result. Let's take a look at it
and then we'll just jump into the code.
So, we have a form where we can add a
description like AirPods and then the
amount. If it is an expense, we should
put minus in front and then we would say
something like
$250. Now, if you say add a transaction,
it'll be added to the list with a nice
animation and your expenses will
increase as well as your balance will be
updated. Now, if you refresh your page,
they will still be here because we will
save them to the local storage. And then
let's try to add something like
salary. That will be an income. So, we
don't really want to put minus just put
the amount itself. So, let's say 2,000.
I'll add this. Here we go. Now it is in
the salary list. Everything has been
updated. I mean it is in the
transactions list. And if we wanted to,
we can delete it. The UI will be updated
immediately as you can tell. And we
could refresh. Everything would stay
here right there. And let's try to add
something. Now, as you can tell, once we
have couple of different items, at some
point this will be scrollable. So this
is something that we will learn as well.
And if you wanted to have these
screenshots, you can find the link in
the description for the diagrams just
like any other project that we have so
far. Right? Okay. Now, with this in
mind, let's go ahead jump into the code
and try to build this end
result. So, the first thing we would
like to do just get started with the
HTML file. As always, I'll put them side
by side and we'll just take a look at
the end result as we go. And here we can
see it is responsive as well. So even if
you are in the smaller screens, it'll
just work properly. Here we have a
little bit of flow, but I think that's
fine. We could fix it in this
uh like in this project. Okay. So let's
go ahead get started with the HTML file.
Let's put the title. I'll just say
expense tracker. And we will link our
CSS file. And let's go ahead use a font
family just like we have done
previously. I'll say command shiftp.
I'll say Google fonts and I'll just
select the insert link. And for the font
family, you can choose anything. I'll go
with pins. Here we go. We got the
import. And we can go into the body
create our container
class. So I just fixed my typo. Let's
say we'll have an h1 which will be this
one. Let's say
expense tracker and we can save. Let's
say open with live server. We'll get
some warnings. That's fine. Here we go.
Now it is working as expected. Now the
other thing we would like to add is the
balance container. Right? So it is this
one that we see. I'll go ahead say
something like balance container. And
we'll have some items like H2 of your
balance. We can put the H1. This will
be, let's say, ID. And this could even
be H3. We can change it. I'll say
balance. This will be the ID. When we
first get started with it, it could be
$0. So, this is what I'll have. And then
we can basically have the summary as
well, which is going to be the income as
well as the expenses. Right? I'll say
summary class. This will have the
income as well as the
expenses. Let's first get started with
the income div. This will be in H3.
Let's say income. This is the text. And
then the P tag. Initially, it'll be
zero. But we will update it within our
JavaScript code. And for the P tag, we
can say something like ID income-
amount. Let's do the exact same thing
for this one. This will be age three of
expenses. And we can basically duplicate
this. Put it right here. This will be
expense amount. Initially it'll be zero
as well. So outside of the summary,
right? Go ahead find this one. And then
outside of the balance container as
well, we'll go ahead put the main
container. Right? So this is what we
have. Right below it, I'll say main dash
content where we would like to put the
transaction container as well as the
form itself. So here I'll go ahead say
transaction dash
container and then I'll duplicate this.
This will be the form
container. Let me show the end result.
So we have built the header part, right?
Now we're going to build the transaction
container as well as the form
container. Okay. So let's get started
with the very first one. So this will
have an H2 that will say
transactions. Then we can go right here.
We'll say we'll have a URL which stands
for unordered lists. And we can give an
ID. Let's say something like transaction
dash list. And now for the content we
are not going to have anything
initially. This will be added with our
JavaScript code. So I'll say
transactions we will be
inserted here
right and then right after this ul as
well as the div we'll go into the form
container where we would like to have
the h2 that says add
transaction. Then we can have our form.
Now this is not going to have any
actions but it'll have an id of
transaction
[Music]
form. Then we'll go within this form
we'll have a div that will have the form
group. So I'll say class form dash
group where we'll have a label as well
as an input. Now let's say this will be
the description.
This is the first input that we are
building and we can give it a four that
will be
description and then we'll create the
input. Let's say type will be text ID
will be
description placeholder it could be
something like enter
description and dot dot dot finally
let's say this will be required. Now why
did we put four? That is for the ID of
description. Well, it's because if you
click to the label, it should focus into
the input. So, this is some best
practice, one of the best practices that
you should keep in mind. Okay, now that
we got the very first form group, we can
duplicate this. I'll basically copy it
and paste this right here. This will be
for the
amount for let's update it. That will be
amount. Type will be not text but number
this time. And this will be required as
well. For the placeholder, we'll say
enter
amount dot dot dot. And after this div
but still within the form, we'll have a
button. Let's say type will be
[Music]
submit and we can say add
transaction just like this. But I think
we are missing one more thing which is
this small element right right below to
the input I'll say small and we can say
use
negative for
expenses. Okay. So with this that's
going to for the entire HTML file. Let
me show this from start to bottom. So we
got the style.css linked. We got the
popins font import. We have the
container with the balance container as
well as the main
content. Okay, so that's entire file.
Let's go ahead link the JavaScript file
as well. First, we will build the
style.css and then we'll get into the
JavaScript. So, I will kill this file
and let's shrink this so that we can see
them side by side. And by the way, this
is the end result that we have. looks
terrible, but we're gonna make it look
nice. So, the first thing we would like
to do, as always, just put the margin of
zero at the padding of zero and box
sizing of border box so that we just
have our basic reset. Then we can say
body and I'd like to put my background
color which will be a linear gradient
within this degree from this color to
this one. Now, it is repeating itself.
So we can say something like min height
will be 100 ph. Here we go. Now it has
been fixed. And I'd like to add the font
family. Let's say it'll be poppins. And
just fold it back with the sense serif.
Then we can say display of flex. You can
just say df aic and jcc. Now everything
should be centered. We could give some
padding such as 20 pixels and then just
update the color that will be 2D
3436. Okay, this is what we have at the
beginning. Now we'll update the
container. I'll say width of
100%. Here we go. We'll say maximum
width will be 1200 pixels. Background
color let's say will be white.
You can either say white or use the hash
value fff. Let's say padding will be
2mm. Let's give some border radiuses
such as 24 pixels. And then some box
shadow. Let's say box shadow. And maybe
just before that we could save. This is
what we got. Let's say box shadow 02
pixels. Duplicate it.
RGBA. And we'll go with the uh let's say
black color. But for the alpha, I'll say
0.15. So we have this subtle uh box
shadow. If you wanted to, you could
increase it, but I think this doesn't
really look nice. This is a lot more
cleaner. And then we can move on with
the H1 element. So I'll go ahead say H1.
Select this. Let's say text align will
be centered. Here we go. We'll say color
will be updated to something like 1 A
200 2N C. Then we'll say margin bottom
of 35
pixels. Let's say font size will be not
font style but font size will be equal
to let's say
2.2m. Then we can say font weight will
be 600 and let's just say letter
spacing. Now we'll be using minus. So
we'll say 0.5 pixels. So notice how they
are just squeezed if you say plus. This
is what'll happen. Let's say like five
pixels too much wide but we would like
to go with minus in this case. Then
let's select the age
2. I'll say the color will be
2D 37 and 48. Here we go. We'll say
margin bottom of 1m. We could say font
size will be 1.25mm. 25 RM and point
family sorry point weight of 500. Here
we go. This is what we have. Now we
would like to select the balance
[Music]
container and say something like text
align will be centered. Then we could
say margin bottom 35
pixels. Padding will be 34 pixels. And
we would like to update the background
color. Now this will be a linear
gradient as well. This is what we have.
Now we would like to add some border
radius such as 15 pixels or maybe let's
just say 1
RM. Here we go. Then we could add some
box shadow on top of it. So say 0 4
pixels 12 pixels
and the let's say black
color. And for the alpha value, we can
go with even less than 1.15 that we have
done above. I'll just go with
0.05. Super subtle, but why not, right?
And then we can select the H1. I'll say
balance container H1. Phone size 3 RM.
We could say margin will be 15 pixels to
zero. And margin bottom specifically
will be 20 pixels. And what happens if
you delete this one? I think there isn't
that much of a change,
but and if you're wondering which H1 is
it, it is this one. You could basically
add this line to be able to see an
element. This is a really nice trick
that you could add in any place. Let's
say you are wondering which one is the
balance container. You could say let's
add a border one pixel solid red. Here
we can see this is that container that
we have selected. So this is um kind of
like a debugging tool that you should
keep in mind. Now we can go ahead build
the summary container. I'll say display
will be grid and we'll have two columns.
Right? Let's take a look at the end
result. Here we go. We have two
different columns. They will be side by
side in large screens. But once we hit
here, I think we could make them like um
one column at a time in our media
queries. But for now, let's focus on
this UI. It'll say display grid. Grid
template columns will be 1 FR 1 FR. Now
they are side by side with the same
size. Gap of let's say 24 pixels. And
then we can say margin top of maybe we
could just say something like 24 pixels.
Then we can go below. We'll select the
main content. I'll say display will be
grid for this one as well. And we'll do
the exact same thing that we have done
above. So I'd like to copy this and put
it right here. Now they are side by
side. And we can give some gap like 24
pixels. And then we can select the
income as well as the
expenses. So we can just uh separate
them with a comma. Then I'll say the
background color will be white. So I can
say white just like this. And we can say
padding will be 24 pixels. Let's save.
This is what we got. We would like to
give some border radius of 1mm. And we
can add some box shadow just like what
we have done above. So I'll copy this.
Put it right
here. Okay. Now when we hover over this
we would like to do something which is
to kind of like translate them in the y
direction in the minus direction
specifically. So I'll say transition
that will be on the transform let's say
0.2 seconds and you can use a method
like ease and then I'll say income hover
state and let's select the same thing
for expenses.
What we would like to do is basically
say
transform. Okay. Why do I have a typo
right here? Let's say transform will be
translate Y minus let's say something
like two
pixels. So this is what'll happen in the
end result. Now we can update the
titles, right? I'll just say
income age three. This will be color of
kind of like a green color. Let's say
it'll be
[Music]
69 like 9669 exactly like this. Then we
can say font size will be
1.1m and we can say font weight could be
maybe like 600 just like this. I can go
ahead and duplicate this for the
expenses but this time the color will be
updated to something like DC let's say
26 26 it is this red color that we have
then we can go ahead select the P tags
and update them as well I'll basically
do the exact same thing maybe this
one put it right here this will be P tag
and I will duplicate this but this will
be for
the
expenses. Okay. So, we just basically
selected the P tags for both of them and
we'll say the font size could be
1 75 RM. Here we can see they are just
greater than the H3 and we can say font
weight for for this one let's say it'll
be 500 and for this one it'll be 600.
Then for the color, we are not going to
put it right here, but we'll say
something like margin top of let's say
eight
pixels. Okay, because the colors will be
different. I'll basically get this
one. Say the color will be the exact
same thing that we have right here. And
we'll do the same thing for expenses. So
I'll copy
this and put the exact same color. Here
we go. And the next thing that we would
like to do select the transaction
container and put them in the let's say
the column direction right so I'll go
ahead right here I'll say select the
transaction container this should be
class and I'll say something like height
of 100 pixels sorry 100% let's save now
this will be updated later in the video
let's say display of flex and the flex
direction of
[Music]
column. Okay. Now we would like to go
right below to it and we can select the
transaction
list. So I'll select it with the ID
selector and I'll say the list style
will be none. Now unfortunately we
cannot see anything at the moment. Later
in the video once we add it from
JavaScript it'll be displayed right
here. So this is the part that we are
trying to build at the moment. Let's put
the classes. We will see the end result
a bit later in the video. So, we'll just
get rid of the list style. We can say
maximum height will be 500 pixels. And
then we'll say overflow in the Y
direction will be scroll or let's say
auto. Now, what happens is this. Let me
display pretty quickly. So the maximum
height will be 500. As you can tell, if
we have more content, they will
overflow. And when they overflow, we
would like to say auto so that we can
get this scroll bar, right? I hope this
makes sense. We have some Let's just put
something. Let's just add something
more. All right. So we have a bunch of
different elements and the maximum
height is 500 pixels. Now they are
overflowing, right? In this case, we say
overflow of Y direction will be auto so
that we can get the scroll bar and
nicely scroll within that. Okay, so this
is exactly what we have done. We wanted
to display it pretty quickly. Then we'll
just say padding of right could be
something like 8 pixels and we can say
flex grow will be one. So it'll take the
take the space as much as possible. Now
I'd like to do something else which is
this scroll bar. So as you can tell the
color is a little bit different because
we are going to style it manually. So
we'll just customize it and let's see
how we can make it work. So we will
basically say something like transaction
list. I'll copy this name and we'll say
double columns and dash webkit. We can
say scroll bar and we can update the
width. So I'll say width will be 8
pixels. Now we can update the track as
well as the thumb. Now what does that
mean? So track is the background of the
scroll bar. So what you have like what
do you see here? I'll just zoom
in. Okay. So this is the track and this
is the thumb. Now we would like to
select them and it'll say something like
when we hover over the thumb just go
ahead change the
color. Now we'll see this in a second.
Let's let's be patient and type this
out. Right. I'll copy this entire thing.
I'll say transaction list webkit
scrollbar dash
track. Let's duplicate this. And this
time it'll be thumb and we'll just
duplicate this once. Once again this
will be thumb on the hover state. Let's
build them. This will be the background
color of let's say f1 f1 f1 and we'll
say border radius of four pixels. And
I'll just add a to-do like to-do show
this later in the video. So once we add
our transactions, I'll just come right
here in the code and try to change
something so that you can see what we
are doing right here. And I'll add a
comment for the track. I'll say track is
the background of the scroll bar and
thumb is the dragable part of the scroll
bar. Now I'd like to change the
background color on this one as well.
that will be let's say CB
D5E and zero. Then we would like to say
something like border radius of four
pixels. Finally, we'll just update the
background color on hover on the
[Music]
thumb. Okay. So, this is the color that
I'll be going with. Now, that's going to
be for the scroll bar uh styles. I'd
like to put this to-do right here. We'll
just come back to it later in the video.
Now, the other thing that we would like
to style will be the transaction itself.
As you can tell, it looks really clean.
And I'd like to just show you show you
something. Now, I'll add an element. And
once I say add transaction, notice how
it'll be animated from the left hand
side, right? So, I'll just slide in.
Let's say add transaction. Here you can
see it just slides in. And for this
we'll be using an animation with key
frames. So let's go ahead and build the
transaction
class. I'll say display of flex. We'll
say space sorry just apply content of
space between. We'll go ahead say align
items of center. And we can give some
padding such as 1mm and 1.1 or let's say
1.2mm.
We'll go ahead say margin bottom of 12
pixels. Border radius of 12 pixels.
Let's say background color of white.
I'll say give some box shadow. It'll be
subtle but still 0 like 0 2 pixels 8
pixels. And
RGBA will go with this exact same value
that we have previously. And I'll say
transition will be all 0.2 2 seconds and
we'll say ease. Finally, we'll just say
border
right because as you can tell we would
like to add some borders, right? I'll
say border right will be five pixels
solid. We don't really want to give a
color at the moment because it'll be
dynamic depending on the type either e
either income or
expense.
[Music]
Okay. And one very last thing that will
be the animation. And we can call this
anything. I'll call it as slide in.
Let's give something like 0.3 seconds.
And I'll say ease. Now let's build the
slide in animation. We can build it with
key frames. I'll say slide in. So
whatever you put here, it should be
right here as well. So if you said
hello, this is the name of your key
frame. So you would say here is my
animation. I hope that makes sense. Now
we would like to add two different
props. We'll say go from this styles to
this one. And now what is happening?
Let's refresh. If you notice like it is
happening pretty quickly, but we are
going from opacity of zero. Say opacity
of zero to opacity of one. And we are
updating the transform on the x
coordinate. So we'll go from left 20
pixels to the initial
state now with the help of this one
right we are starting from here going to
this one that will make it to slide in
from the left hand
side. Okay so we're going to see this
later in the video in action and finally
we can add some hover states update the
transaction income expense etc. Now, I
know that we are going really really
slowly, but I just want to explain every
single thing in this style CSS file
because we are learning a lot of
different new concepts in this tutorial,
right? So, let's just move on. Maybe we
can split things a bit up, but let's go
ahead and complete this entire file.
Now, what do we want to do is this. When
we hover over the transaction, we would
like to change the box shadow and maybe
take it to the right hand side, right?
So I'll just add this part where I say
transaction.hover go ahead translate it
on the X direction and add some box
shadow and for the transaction income we
will add this border color border right
color specifically and for the expense
we will add this one. So this is exactly
what we have done and we will say now
let's add this delete button. Now,
initially it is not really visible. Once
you hover over the element, you're able
to see it. And once you hover over the
icon itself, you'll be able to see this
background color. Right? So to be able
to implement that, I'll go ahead say
transaction.delete button. Now we'll say
the background will be null initially,
no borders at all. This would be the
color, cursor pointer, font size, and
opacity of zero. That means it is not
going to be visible initially but once
we hover over it we would like to change
the opacity and also we have like
transition some paddings border radiuses
and some margin on the left hand side.
So I'll say once we hover over the
transaction go ahead select the delete
button and say opacity will be one that
will give this exact same behavior. So
it is not visible opacity of zero but
once you hover over it it is visible
right now the other thing that we would
like to implement is this when we hover
over this it'll just scale a little bit
right and we should be able to see the
background so we'll go ahead say
transaction select the delete button and
when we hover over that change the
background color and scale it a bit up
now I'm just pasting copying and pasting
but explaining every single line so I
don't really I think this is counted as
copy and paste because we are explaining
every single line. Now we are going to
go ahead and select the form container.
Build this one and then we can jump into
the JavaScript section. Okay. So once
again on the form we have some linear
gradients. We have some paddings, border
radiuses, some box shadow as you can
tell and the flex direction is column.
Right? We're going in the vertical
direction. So I'll basically add
everything that I just said into the
form container and then we can select
the form itself and make it to be in the
flex d column direction as well just
like this. Then we can add some margin
bottoms on every single element. Right?
So we have this form group which is our
description and enter description input.
We're going to give some margin bottom
right here and same for this one. So
this is what we are doing. Just adding
some margin bottom on the form group
class. Now we can select the label
itself. Just change the color. Add some
margin bottom display of blog and font
weight of 500. So at this point we are
just repeating ourselves. Right? We are
just adding the same thing here in this
file. That's why I'd like to copy and
paste for the next items and just walk
you through it. You can type this out or
get it from the source code. So for the
input elements, we are adding the width,
padding, some borders, border radius,
font size, background color, and some
transitions. Now when we focus into the
input, we're going to add some box
shadow and we will update the border
color. Now let's see if I click to this
one. This is the end result by the way.
But here is what happens. So this is
that focus state that we have just added
something in. Now we would like to say
if we are on the hover state on the
input we would like to change the border
color and we can select the small
element just add some really really
basic styling. Then we can select our
select our button. Now this button is
the type of submit. How do you select a
button that is type of submit
specifically? Well you can do something
like button and then whatever the
attribute that you would like to have.
So the type is equal to submit. Go ahead
select that button specifically. So if
you had a
button right below to it and the type of
this let's say something different like
menu then this styles would not be
implemented on this button. I hope that
makes
sense. And we are just changing the
background color adding some different
colors right such as white border
radiuses like everything that you have
seen here. Super simple. I don't really
want to go through it. So, we'd like to
add the hover state as well as the
active state on the button. Right on the
active, we'll say translate Y of zero.
So, first when you hover over it, it is
a bit up and once you click to it, it'll
just go down. Okay. So, that's the
entire CSS that we need. The only thing
we left is the
responsiveness here. I'd like to add my
media queries pretty quickly. This is
the first one that we'll add. And the
other one is for even smaller screens
like for the mobile phones. Here are the
stylings that I have just added. Super
simple. These are the things that we
have learned previously. So I'd like to
just skip this pretty quickly. So 300
lines of CSS. That's huge. But we have
learned lots of different new things in
this project itself. Now in the next
part we can build the script.js JS file
to implement the actual functionality.
And this is the end result. By the way,
the styles that we have written is
working as expected. It is completely
responsive up until here. So there is no
issues at all. Okay. Now we can just
jump into the script.js and get started
with it. So the first thing we would
like to do as always just go ahead get
the DOM elements. Now I'll just paste
this list because I don't want to type
this out. And if you don't want to type
this out as well, I have prepared a list
for you. The link will be in the
description. You can find the expense
tracker.md file. And go ahead, copy this
entire thing. Paste this in. So we are
basically getting the balance element,
income amount, expand amount, expense
amount, and everything that we would
need. Now the first thing we would like
to do just get the transactions. And as
I said previously, the previous
transactions will be stored in the local
storage. So if you refresh this page
like you will see the previous data and
for this we can say something like let
transactions initially this could be an
empty array but we'll say or if we have
something in the local storage go ahead
and get that I'll just say get item
[Music]
transactions. Okay now since we are
getting something from the local storage
we would like to wrap this with a
JSON.parse parse so that we can get the
structured data instead of a string.
Okay, here we go. This is what we're
going to have in a single line and we
would like to update these transactions
list whenever we add something or
whenever we delete something. Right?
Let's take a look at this part. By the
way now the first thing I'd like to do
get the transaction form element. Right?
On this one we are going to listen for
the submit event. So I'll say
transaction form element do event
listener listen for the submit event and
we would like to run a method called add
transaction and this is what we would
like to create. Now I'll copy the name
let's say function paste this
in okay now this will get the event by
default so for now if you just save this
file and try to submit this form. So
here I'll just say airpods and let's say
200. If I say add the transaction,
notice how it'll refresh my page. So,
this is the default behavior on forms,
right? When you submit something, it'll
go ahead and re refresh your page. And
what we'd like to do is just say
event.prevent default so that it doesn't
really uh it doesn't really refresh the
page. Now, we can go ahead save this
file and let's test this out once again.
I'll put something. Let's say submit
that. Now, it doesn't really refresh my
page. Right now, we're going to go ahead
and get some values such as the form
values. Right? I'll just say get the
form values. The very first one is the
description. I'll say description
element dot value. Let's say value just
like this. And we can say trim. Okay, we
just got the description. Now, we can
get the amount. I'll say const amount
let's say amount element dot value and
what I'd like to do convert this to to
let's say uh integer I'll just say parse
float here we go because by default the
type of it would be string let's
actually try to see I'll just say
console log type of
amount without doing this let's see
what'll happen what are we going to head
from the terminal I'll say like 200 add
the
transaction okay it says description
element is not a function what do you
mean okay it should be value but without
like it's not a method it's property
let's save and add something like 200
and put
something as you can tell that the type
is string by default but if you add the
parse
float here I'll just wrap it
Now let's try to submit the same
thing. Okay, type is number now as we
can tell. So this is what I'd like to
do. And now we would like to create a
transaction. I'll say
transactions
dopush. We're going to basically push an
object into into that list, right? I'll
say ID could be date now because we are
going to sort them, right? Let's take a
look at the end result. If you add
something new, let's say 100, it will be
added at the very top. So notice how it
is right here. And this is how we can
sort them depending on the type or we
can reverse them. That's another thing.
But I'd like to just add a unique ID.
And this is what we can use. Then we can
say description. Just add that. So you
can say description. This is the key and
the value will be this one. But since it
is the same thing on both sides, you can
delete it and shorten this. And let's do
the same thing for the
amount. Okay. Now we have updated the
transactions list. We would like to save
this to the local storage as well. I'll
say local storage set item. Set it into
the
transactions. And we would like to say
JSON. Stringify. Whenever you want to
add something to the local storage, you
would like to stringify it first and
then whatever that is. In our case, it
is the transactions array. Now that we
have saved to the local storage, we can
update the UI. So just say update
transaction list called the method. This
is something that we're going to build.
And then let's say update summary as
well. So this is another method that
we're going to build. Once we have done
this, we can basically reset the form.
I'll say transaction form element dot
reset. It should be reset just like
this. Okay. So let's get started with
this method. I'll say function update
transaction list and we'll go inside.
The first thing we would like to do just
clear clear the previous list. So I'll
say transaction element list element dot
inner HTML will be nothing because
basically we are just resetting it at
the moment and then we're going to add
whatever we have. Now I'd like to sort
the transactions by the most recent
first. So I can say something like const
sorted transactions. Just get everything
that we have under the transactions and
we would like to reverse
this. Here we go. You can also use the
date, right? You can use the ID uh
sorted depending on the ID, but this
would also work without any issues. And
now we would like to add each
transaction to the list. I'll say sorted
transactions do for each. Let's get the
each
transaction and run this method where
we'd like to say create
transaction element. which is going to
be a method and we'll just say
transaction pass it into it. Then we
would like to build this method. This
will give us the list item right it will
give us the let's say transaction
element and we would like to append this
to the UI. I'll say transaction list
element dot append child and it will be
this child which is the transaction
element. Now let's create this method. I
know that at the moment it might not
make too much sense but once we complete
everything it should be pretty clear and
crisp. So I'll go ahead and basically
create this method. Here we go. This
will take the transaction as the
argument and we are going to create a
list item. Now why this is the case here
we said that the transactions will be
inserted here which is a ul element. So
we would like to basically put couple of
different list items right here and
those will be whatever you submit.
Right? Okay. So this is exactly what
we're going to be doing right now. The
first thing we would like to do just
create a list element. I'll say document
createelement which is going to be a
list item. Then we'll say list item
doclass
list class list dot add. And the thing
that we would like to add will be the
transaction class. Then we would like to
add another thing that will be either
income or expense. So I'll basically
duplicate this. And here I'll say if
transaction dot amount if it is greater
than zero that means it is an income. So
we're going to add the income class. But
else if it is negative which means it is
an expense. I hope that makes sense. Now
we can update the inner HTML which is
the content. Let's say inner HTML and
I'll put back text because we'll go make
this multiple lines here. I'll have a
span element and we need to type this
out manually. Let's open this up. Close
this off. And I would like to say here
it'll take the
transaction description. Then we would
like to have another span. I'll
duplicate that. This will take the
transaction amount. Now, we would like
to format this. We're going to wrap it
with a method, but I'll just leave it as
a to-do in a second. Um, the other thing
that I'd like to do still within this
pan, I'll create a button, which is
going to be this delete button,
right? Okay. So, I'll say
button and close this off. Okay. We're
going to give the class name. Let's say
class will be equal to delete dash
button. And please be very very careful.
Just type it out exactly what I do. So
do not forget the quotes. Anything that
we have right here otherwise it's going
to crash, right? So you should add the
closing tags, opening tags, like
everything it should be correctly. Okay,
we have the class name on click. We're
going to add. So once we click to this
button, what do we want to do? just
remove a transaction here. I'll open up
my uh quotes and I'll say remove
transaction call this method with the
transaction ID. So this is another
method that we're going to build. Let's
maximize this here. I'll say we will put
the
transaction ID. Once again, this will
make a lot of sense just in a couple of
minutes. And for the button content, it
could be this X icon, right? The X
character. Okay. So, this is what we
have. We have a to-do. We will fix in a
little bit. If you wanted to, you can
add a comment maybe right here. Let's
say to-do update the let's say amount
formatting.
So this is what I do almost always
adding a to-do so that I do not forget
it in either case right in any case.
Okay. So that's going to be for the
inner HTML. Now we can basically return
the list item which is the thing that we
are getting and appending it to the UI.
Okay. So that's going to be it for this
update transaction list method. The
other thing that we need to build is the
update summary method. For now, I'll
comment this out and just test it out
just to make sure that everything is
working as expected. Okay, let's go
here. I'll refresh and we'll say enter
description could be like let's say my
salary and for the amount let's just go
with 500 and I'll say add the
transaction. As we can tell it has been
added without any issues, right? If we
click to it, nothing will happen because
we haven't built the method. But this is
a bit later in the video. Okay. Now we
have updated this part but the summary
has not been updated. This is something
that we would like to do right now. I'll
go ahead uncomment this one. Copy the
name and create the method at the very
bottom with a
function. This will not get any
arguments but we'll just go right here
and try to calculate the total balance.
Okay. So the first thing I'd like to do
just say const balance. This will be the
total balance. We'll say transactions
and we can use the reduce method. Let's
say reduce. And you can use this on
arrays. This is an array method. And
since the transactions is an array, we
can safely use it. And here is how that
work. So this will basically take a call
back and then an accumulator, right? and
we are going to start with zero and
we'll add on top of it. Now let me give
you an example. Let's say we have an
expense or let's say we have an income
of 100. We have an expense of minus 50.
We have another income 200 and let's say
something another expense with let's say
minus 200. What this meth method will do
it'll just get
uh add these values on top of zero. So
we're going to start with 0 + 100 + - -
50 + 200 + - 200. So this will be equal
to zero. This will be equal to 50. At
the end the balance will be 50. I hope
that makes sense. And now let's see how
this will work. I just need to explain
it in really detail because maybe this
is your very first time seeing this
method. So we're going to get the
accumulator, right? and then the
transaction itself. So here we'll say
accumulator plus this is what we would
like to return transaction dot
amount. Okay. So once again I'd like to
walk you through it pretty quickly. So
we're going to start with zero
accumulator is equal to zero and the
first transaction is equal to 100. So 0
+ 100 this will be equal
to 100. Right now this will be the new
accumulator. So we have 100 at the
moment as our accumulator. So 100 + -
50. Right? 100 + - 50 will be 50. This
is our new accumulator. So on and so
forth. We'll just go through it until we
complete this entire array. I hope this
makes sense. I genuinely wanted to
explain this super slow so that it makes
sense. Now we got the total balance.
Let's try to calculate the income. So
I'll say cost income transactions. Now
this is an array. We would like to first
filter out the let's say first we'd like
to get the incomes, right? The positive
numbers. So we'll say get every single
transaction where the transaction
amount is greater than zero. And then
we'll do the same thing that we have
done above. we would like to um reduce
it to a value. So we'll copy the entire
thing. Paste this
in. We'll get accumulator the
transaction and we will add it on top of
zero. But this will be the positive
values only. We can do the exact same
thing for the
expenses. And we'll say if the amount is
less than zero just grab them. and
finally reduce it into a one single
value. Now that we got all the values,
we can update the UI. We'll say update
UI. Let's say balance
element.ext content will be equal to the
balance. And we'll basically do the same
thing for uh income amount
element as well as the expense amount.
So here I'll just say income. Let's
duplicate it. This will be expenses. And
then we would like to say expense amount
element. Now I'll add another to-do
right here. I'll say to-do fix the
formatting. Again, we're going to create
a method and wrap them with these
arguments, but it'll just be in a couple
of minutes. For now, let's save and
actually test this
out. So here, I'll go ahead take a look
at the end result. This is what we have.
I'll just refresh. We get rid of the
previous state, but it'll just come back
once we use the local storage. So for
now, let's say my salary to this time
I'll add 500. Add the transaction here.
We can see the balance has been updated,
right? And we can say now
uh something like AirPods it is expense.
I'll say minus 200. at the transaction
everything is being updated. Now, as you
can tell, this is not really formatted.
We would like to see something like this
and it is really easy to build thanks to
the
internalization method or the API.
Basically, I will create a method called
format uh format the currency. Let's say
function format currency.
This will take the number that we would
like to format and we'll say return
new internalization. So in NL do number
format. So we would like to use N US and
then an object where we can say the
style will be equal to
currency and the currency itself will be
let's say US dollars. And we'll just say
dot format this
number. Okay. Now we can go ahead wrap
them with the format currency
method just like
this. Now we are able to see them. But
this is actually coming from HTML,
right? This is the previous state. It is
not coming from here. But if we were to
get the previous items. So I'll just go
ahead add something else. Let's say
something and I'll say 1,000 add the
transactions. Uh here we can see like
it's been updated with the format
currency method. Now the thing is if we
refresh this page all the data is gone.
It is actually in the local storage. So
how can we get that? Well, basically in
the
initial render, we would like to call
the update summary as well as the update
transaction list method. So, let's go
ahead call both of them. And here we go.
When you refresh, it'll just get you the
data from the local storage. Okay. So, I
think I have another to-do. Let's go
scroll to the top here. I said we would
like to format the amount right here.
I'll go ahead wrap this transaction
amount with the format currency method.
Now if you
save everything should be working as
expected. This is the correct usage
right? If you try to create a
transaction
element I'll just say like airports
airpods 2 I'll say 500 and this should
be an expense. As you can tell it has
been formatted right here as well.
Without this it wouldn't
be okay. Now I think the very last thing
that we need is the remove transaction
method. When we click to this button it
will run but we don't really have it. So
let's go ahead and create it. I'll say
function remove transaction and this
will get the ID of the transaction so
that we can identify which one is that
that we are trying to delete. So here
I'll just say basically filter out the
one we want to delete. Okay, we'll say
the new transactions will be equal to
transactions filter. We're going to get
every single transaction but we would
like to get the specific one and just
filter that out, right? Like get rid of
that. I'll say transaction do ID if it
is not equal to this ID that we have
just keep it in the array but if we have
that get rid of it so this is how that
work and we'll say now that we have
updated it let's save it to the local
storage so basically we will update our
local storage which is the
transactions and we'll say JSON
stringify put the new transactions
Okay, finally we'll just update the UI,
right? I'll say update transactions
list and finally update summary. So this
is the beauty of having methods. So we
don't really need to write this entire
logic again and again. Whenever we need
it, we would just call it just like
right here and even up here as you can
tell. Okay, now we can delete this
to-do, save this, and give it a go with
the remove functionality. So, I'll
delete the something. As we can tell,
our income has been updated. The
transaction list has been updated. And
we can add more things. I'll basically
go ahead and add some AirPods. I'll say
minus 200. Let's add another thing like
salary
500. Basically, anything. I'll just try
to show show
something. I'll say, you know, some
text. Okay. So, I said we're going to
have some to-dos in the style. CSS
file when it comes to the WebKit scroll
bar, right? Okay. Now, let's try to go
over it once again. So, I just said that
the scroll bar track would be the
background. Let's say the background
color will be
red. As you can tell, the background of
the scroll bar is red at the moment. So,
this is something that you can play
around with. I'll bring this back. And
the scroll bar thumb is the scrollable
element itself. Let's say the background
will be
blue. As you can tell, it's been
updated, right? When we hover over this,
it changes thanks to this line. Okay.
Okay, so these are the some values that
you could play and I wanted to add a
to-do so that we can just go over it
pretty quickly. Let's say you want to
update the width. So this is how it'll
look like. I think that this is a bit
too much. So we can go with eight. Okay,
so with that that's going to be it for
this entire project where we have
learned about bunch of different things
when it comes to the CSS and for the
very first time we have worked with the
local storage in this series. So, I hope
you enjoyed the entire project. I'll see
you in the next
one. So, in this section, we're going to
build a bookmark saver application. So,
here's how that work. We can add a name
as well as a URL. So, let's go ahead and
add something like, you know, I'll say
Twitter and I can say
https and I can zoom in. Let's say
twitter.com. Add the bookmark. Now, it's
been added. If we click it, this is the
page that we that we will be redirected
and if we wanted to, we can delete it
and everything that we have here will be
saved to the local storage. So if you
refresh the page, it'll still be here.
All right. So you can see the screenshot
within our diagrams. Now let's get into
the application. The very first thing
I'd like to do just build the HTML. Then
we're going to get into the CSS and then
the JavaScript file. Okay. So, I'll
maybe zoom in just like this. And this
is the end result, by the way. Let me
update the title for that. I'll say end
result. And we're going to build our own
document now. Let's say bookmark
saver. Okay, let's open this up within a
new
tab. Okay, here we go. This is what we
have. Now, the very first thing I'd like
to do is link my CSS
file. Here we go. And then we can get
started with the UI. So, I'll just have
an app
container. Then we will have a H1
element that will be this title that
says bookmark
saver. Okay. Then right below to it,
we'll have an input container. Right.
I'll say input dash container. Here we
go. And we're going to put two different
inputs, both of these. And then a
button. So I'll say the very first one
will be input, which is a type of text.
We can give it an ID like bookmark dash
name. And then a placeholder, which can
be bookmark name just like this one.
Okay. Then I'll go ahead duplicate this
one. The type for this will be URL.
Let's say ID will be bookmark URL and
update the
placeholder within or I should say below
to this input we're going to have a
button let's say button give it an ID
like add dash bookmark and then we will
say add
bookmark okay so that's the entire UI
very last thing that we need is kind of
like a list component where we can put
these items as we add something right
right after this button and after this
div so outside of the input container we
will have a ul with the id that will be
bookmark d-list for the content we will
not have anything it'll be coming from
the local storage or whenever we add
something it'll just be updated okay so
that's entire HTML file let's go ahead
uh sorry let's go ahead and add the
script
file. So, we just linked our JavaScript
file as well. Now, it is time to move on
with the CSS file. And by the way, this
is what we have without any styling.
Now, let's go ahead and get started with
the basic reset that we do every single
time. So, I'll say margin of zero,
padding of zero, and box sizing of
border box. Now, we can select the body.
Let's say font family will be sense
serif. We can change the background
color. Instead of the white value, I'll
just go kind of like grayish which will
be this value. And then let's say color
will be like three couple of times and
display of flex justify content
center just like this and then align
item center. Now finally we'll say
entire height will be equal to the
entire screen. Now everything has been
centered. Now we would like to select
the app
container. We can say background color
will be
fff just like this. And padding let's
say 20 pixels from all directions. And
let's give some rounded corners. I'll
say border radius of 8 pixels. And some
let's say box shadow that will be 0 to 4
pixels. Let's duplicate it.
8 pixels or let's go even with 10
pixels. Then finally the color. I'll say
RGBA. We'll go with the black
one.1. Okay, this is what we have. Now
we'd like to say maximum width will be
400 pixels and then the width will be
100%. Here we go. And then we can say
text align will be
centered. And instead of 100% width,
I'll go with 90% so that it is not
touching the corners. Here we go. Then
I'll just say H1. Let's select the color
and update it to be a green value like
2E C 71. Then we can say margin bottom
of 20 pixels. This is what we got. Now
we can select the input container
itself.
input dash container. We'll go ahead say
display flex so that they are side by
side. We can say flex direction of
column because we want them to be in the
column direction. Here we go. If you
don't add this, by default they would be
side by side. And then we would like to
say gap of
10. Then finally we can say margin
bottom of 30 pixels from the list item
that we'll have later in the video. Then
we can say the input that could be
padding of 10
pixels. Then we can say give some border
radiuses like four pixels. Then we can
update the border itself. I'll say 1
pixel solid dd. Here we go. Then we can
select the
button. I'll say padding of 10 pixels.
Then we can say background color will be
this exact same value. Then we can say
something like the color could be
white. Then no borders. Let's say border
of
none. We'll say border radius of 4
pixels. We can say the cursor will be
pointer. And on hover that let's say
button do hover state. We would like to
change the background color to be this
value which will be 27 AE 60.
Now we can add some transition, right?
I'll say transition will be on the
background
color and we'll say 0.3 seconds with the
ease function. Okay, now we can get
started with the bookmark list even
though we don't have it in the UI. This
will be a bit later in the video once we
have these items right. I'll say
bookmark dash list. Then we'll say list
style will be none. And then we can say
petting will be zero. Then we can select
the list items itself. So I'll copy this
thing. We'll say list item can change
the background color which will be this
value. Let me paste this in. Then we can
have some paddings like 10 pixels. Can
update the border which will be 1 pixel.
Solid and dd.
We can say border radius will be four
pixels, margin bottom of 10 pixels,
display of flex and then we would like
to say like justify content will be
space
between let's say space between and then
align items center. Here we go. Then we
can select the A elements. I'll say
bookmark dash list a element which is
the link that will be color of this
exact value and we can say text
decoration will be none so that we get
rid of the underline text decoration
which is coming by default then we can
select the button element which is this
one and give this kind of like a delete
background color right I'll say
uh bookmark dash list so like the button
background color will be
E74
C3C and then we can say color could
be white as well. We'll go ahead say no
borders. Some border radiuses like four
pixels. Heading of five pixels to 10
pixels from top and left like top,
bottom and left and right. And then
cursor will be pointer. Then we can
finally say give some
transition of let's say background
color. Okay. So 0.3 seconds with the
ease function. Now we can select the
exact same thing but change the hover
state. Okay. I'll say background color
will be equal to this value which is C
0392B. Okay, so that's going to be for
the entire styling. Now we can jump into
the JavaScript code. And just before we
jump into the JavaScript, you might be
asking what we have here is almost the
exact same thing that we have on the
button. So why do we need to add all of
them? You are absolutely right. So we
can go ahead and delete the parts that
we don't really need. So this thing is
exactly the same. We can delete it.
These styles are exactly the same. We
can delete it. The only difference will
be the background color as well as the
padding. So I'll go ahead save. Nothing
should change. Right? This would be
working as expected. Now this is not
what we have. But this is what we have
at the moment. But the end result will
look like this. So what we have just
done update the padding on this button
as well as the background color. the
everything by default would be coming
from the regular button component that
we have. Okay, with this in mind, let's
go ahead open up the script.js file and
get started with it. So the first thing
we would like to do just get all the DOM
elements that we would need such as the
name input, URL input, the button as
well as the list that we have right
here. And I have prepared a GitHub gist
that you can copy and paste all of them
if you don't want to type this out. So
the link will be in the description. Go
ahead, find the bookmarks saver.md and
copy this entire thing. So this is what
I have done. This is what this is what I
have right here. Right? So we are
basically selecting every single element
with their ids and assigning them into
some variables. So the first thing we
would like to do whenever we like
whenever we visit this application we
want the like bookmarks that we have in
the local storage to be loaded
immediately right. So they are going to
be coming from the local storage. So
I'll just say
document.adde event listener whenever
the DOM content loaded. Basically
whenever the website is loaded we would
like to call a method called load
bookmarks. And this is something that
we're going to build in a couple of
minutes. For now let's just leave it as
an empty
function. Okay. So that's the first
thing. The other thing we would like to
say is the add bookmark button event
listener. Right. We are going to add an
event listener which is going to be
click and we're going to call this
anonymous function. So let's go ahead
create
it and just try to get started with it.
So when you want to add something the
first thing we would like to do is get
the name as well as the URL. So this is
what I'll be doing. I'll just say const
name bookmark name input do
value and we can just trim that down.
Let's duplicate this. This time this
will be for the bookmark URL input. So
we're going to get that value and assign
it to
URL. Okay, we got both of these values.
But now if one of them is not provided,
it'll say please enter both of them.
I'll just put something here and try to
add. As you can tell, it just crashes,
right? So I'll say if there is no name
or if there is no URL we would like to
alert something I'll say
please enter
both name and
URL and we would like to just return out
of it. So we don't really want to do
anything else because they just failed.
But in the else's case that means they
have provided both of them. we can go
through a quick validation check. Now,
what does that mean? I'll add let's say
YouTube, but for the bookmark, I'll just
say YouTube.com without HTTP or HTTPS.
Here, we'll get an alert that says
please put one of these at the
beginning. So, this is what we're going
to be doing. I'll say if
URL starts with well actually not starts
with. So if this is the case where it
does not start with
HTTP and we'll say if it does not starts
with I'll basically copy this entire
thing and I'll say https. If this is the
case we can show an alert. Let's say
please enter a valid URL
starting with
HTTP or
HTTPS and we would like to return out of
this method. Um if this is the case but
in case we can just go right here call a
method called add bookmark. This is
something that we're going to create
where we would like to add the name as
well as the URL. And we also want to
save this bookmark to local storage. So
I'll say save
bookmark. I'll say add the name as well
as the URL. Then finally we would like
to reset the form. Once we add
something, it should update the UI.
Right? Let's take a look at the end
result. I'll say
https add this form has been resetted.
So we'll say bookmark name input do
value will be equal to an empty string.
Let's do the same thing for bookmark URL
input do
value. Okay. Now it is time to build
these methods. So the first thing I'll
be doing is to build the add bookmark
not btn. This just should be add
bookmark because it is a function that
we are about to build. We're going to
take the name as well as the URL and
we'll go ahead create a uh list item.
We'll say
document.createelement. That will be a
list item. And then we would like to
create another element that will be a
link. So here I'll say
link and then we would like to say
link.h will be whatever the URL is. Then
we can say link.ext content will be
whatever the name is. And when we click
to the link. So notice how it'll open up
in the new tab. And to be able to add
this, we'll say
[Music]
link.target say target will be equal to
underscore blank. If you do not add this
line, it'll be opened in the current
tab, right? It'll just replace the
current URL. This is what we have just
done. And then we would like to add the
remove button. So I'll say con remove
btn or let's just say
[Music]
button that will be equal to
document.createelement which is going to
be a button element. Then we can add the
text content. So we'll say remove button
dot text content will be equal to
remove. And then we can say remove
button dot add event listener. So when
we click to this button we will click to
delete something right. So I'll say
function and within this we will say
first uh remove this from the UI right
I'll say bookmark list dot remove
child which is this list item that we
just clicked. So we add the list item
itself. It's because both of them are
linked right. So if you click this
button, it'll delete the li that you
have just created which is this one that
right here right and then once we have
done this once we update the UI we would
like to remove it from the local storage
as well. I'll say remove bookmark from
storage and this is a method that we're
going to build just in a second. Let's
say pass the name as well as the URL.
Okay, so we have created the list item
but we never added the link and the
remove button into it. Right? I'll just
say alli.append child where we'll append
the link and then let's duplicate this.
Within the ally, we're going to append
the remove button. And finally, we will
take the list item and append it to the
UI. I'll say bookmark list.append child.
And we're going to basically append the
list item itself. Okay. Okay, so let's
move on. I'll just save. Now the next
function that I'd like to create is
called a get
bookmarks from storage. So this is a
helper function that we'll be using a
lot. And all this does as the name
suggests it'll just go ahead get the
bookmarks from the local storage. So
we'll say bookmarks will be equal to
local storage.get item and we can give
this key. I'll say bookmarks and we
would like to say just return the
bookmarks. But now if this is undefined,
right, we would like to return an empty
array instead. So I'll just say if we
have the bookmarks, go ahead say
JSON.parse the
bookmarks but else just return an empty
array. And let's move on with the next
function which will be save
bookmark. that will take the name as
well as the URL. We'll go ahead and
first get the bookmarks from the local
storage. So this is why we have built
this method in the first place. We'll
just say get the bookmarks from the
storage and we would like to add this
new one on top of it. We'll say
bookmarks.push where we would like to
push a new object with the name as well
as the URL that we just got. And then we
can say local storage dot set item. So
we'll just update it with the ne value,
right? I'll say set item that will be
added into the bookmarks and we would
like to add some value. So we so we'd
like to say JSON stringify and whatever
the value is which is the bookmarks.
Okay, so that's going to be it for this
method as well. Now let's build this one
as well as the remove bookmarks method
and that should be it. So if we want to
load the bookmarks, we would like to say
con bookmarks just like what we have
done here. I'll copy it and paste it.
Then I'll say for every single one of
them just map through it and put it into
the UI. So I'll say
bookmarks dot for
each and for every single one of them we
would like to say add bookmark. Go ahead
call this method with the name. I'll say
name and the URL and that should be it.
This is going to update the UI. And
finally, this is the very last function
I promise. I'll say remove bookmark from
the storage that will take the name as
well as the URL. And we'll go into
within this function and let's grab
every single every single bookmark that
we have from the storage. And then we
can filter this out, right? We're going
to delete this one that we would like to
like the user wants to delete. I'll say
the new bookmarks will be equal
to bookmarks filter and we're going to
get
the bookmark itself. Right? Every single
one of them. But we would like to filter
out only one of those. I'll say
bookmark
name is not equal to this
name or let me maximize this. So we'll
say or bookmark URL is not equal to the
URL. So this will basically filter out
the one that you would like to delete.
And finally we can update the local
storage once
again as we have done above. Okay. So,
I'll just save and give it a go. Test
this out if it is working correctly or
not. So, I'll just refresh and I'll just
try to add a bookmark name. I'll say my
GitHub profile. Let's add
it. Uh, I'll say github.com and my
username. Now, if I don't really ask
this field, I'll get an alert. If I
don't add it with HTTP or HTTPS, I'll
get an alert. But if I put it correctly,
it should be added. And I'll refresh. It
is still here. I can delete it. Here we
go. And I can refresh it. Okay, it's
still here. Why this is the case? So
this is the case. It's because we say
constant and we try to reassign it. If
you take a look at the terminal, you're
going to see that we have some errors.
I'll try to say remove. Here we can see
we are just getting some errors. Our
application breaks. So instead of cost,
we should say allet. Now let's test this
out. I'll go ahead delete this. Refresh.
It is not there because it has been
deleted. Okay, with this in mind, that's
going to be for this entire project
where we have built a bookmark saver.
And I'll see you in the next project. In
this section, we're going to build a
simple registration form where we have
some form validations. So let me walk
you through it. in the end result and
then we'll just jump into the code. So
if I do not fill anything and I say
register, I'll get bunch of different
errors. Let's go ahead and fill them in.
I'll say this is the username such as
John Doe. Let's give it an email
atgmail.com and I'll say password from 1
2 3 and 1 2 3. Now here we can see it
says these are valid but password must
be at least six characters. So I'll go
ahead and say 4 5 6. Now it says they do
not match. And if I put everything
correctly, but if I don't have a valid
email, then it's going to crash as well.
Email is not valid. Let's put this back
and put something like just jo and run
this. It says username must be at least
three characters. And let's bring this
back. Finally, let's say register. It
says the, you know, registration is
successful. And here we go. Form has
been resetted. So this is the entire
project that we're going to build and
you can find the screenshots within the
diagram that we have the link in the
description completely for free. Okay,
now let's jump into VS Code. I have
three different files HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. Let's put them side by side
and first get started with HTML file. So
I'll get my boiler plate and then I'll
just add a title. Let's say form
validator. I'll say link link my CSS
file and at the very bottom of the body
I'll say script source script.js. Okay.
Now let's get started with the container
that we will have and this will have a
form. We are not going to have any
actions but we'll have an ID. Let's say
it is called as
registration dash form. Then we'll go
ahead say h1. We're going to put this H1
the heading let's say register then we
can go ahead get the username field
right so we're going to build this one
then the rest and finally the
button so I'll say form dash group that
will have the label input and another
element that we will see so I'll say
label this will be for username input
and the text will be username
Let's say input type of text and we can
say ID of the username and then the
placeholder it'll be enter
username and we can run this file by the
way. Okay. So this is what we have. If
we click to the label it will focus
because of the linking that we have. We
say this label will be for the uh input
that has ID of the username. So if I
click it, it focuses. And then we're
going to create a small element that
will be empty. And we're going to fill
this in whenever we have an error.
Right? So this is that small element
that will be hidden by default and and
it's not going to have any content. So
we're going to like we're going to see
this in a couple of minutes. All right.
Now what we can do is basically
duplicate this for the
email. Let's say the uh four will be for
the email. This will be email as well.
Type will be email. ID will be email.
And we'll say enter
email. Okay. Let's duplicate this once
again. This will be for the password.
I'll basically select all of these and
I'll say
password. Okay. And one last time I'll
duplicate this and let's say that that
was the password and this is the confirm
[Music]
password. Okay. I'll select every single
one of them. Let's say um
confirm password and I'll give a space
and let's say
enter or let's just say for the
placeholder it'll be confirm
password. Okay, so this is the end
result that we have. We would like to
add a button and then jump into the CSS
file.
[Music]
Let's say type will be submit and then
the content will be
register just like this. Now let's save
and go back into the CSS file that we
have and get started with it. The very
first thing I'd like to do add my reset.
So I'll say margin of zero, padding of
zero and box sizing of border box. I'll
select the body element. I'll give the
background color. Instead of white, I'll
go with this hash value of F9 couple of
times. Here we go. And then I'll say one
family. We can go with sense serif. If
you'd like to change it, definitely feel
free to do so. Then I'll say display
flex align item centered justify content
centered and we'll say minimum height
would be 100 VH. So we are basically
setting up the height to be 100 VH and
centering the entire content in the
middle of the screen. Then we'll go
ahead select the container element.
We'll say background color will be
white. Here we go. We'll say border
radius will be 8 pixels. So this is what
we have. Maybe it is not really that
visible but this is that container we
just created. And then okay this should
not be a background repeat but border
dash radius and then we'll say box
shadow I'll say 0 pixels 5 pixels to 15
pixels and then the rgba of the classic
color that we use. So I'll go with black
and for the alpha I'll say
0.1. Here we go. Then I'll say width
will be 100% but the maximum width will
be 400
pixels and then we can say um give some
paddings such as 30 pixels and then we
could say overflow of
hidden then I'll get the H1 and say text
align will be centered. Then I can say
color will be three bunch of times and
then margin bottom of 20 pixels let's
say. Here we go. You can also use RM.
I'll just go with 1.2 RM. Then we can
select the form group
element. I'll go ahead say margin bottom
will be 20 pixels. Now we also want to
add the position of relative. And
because like let me display we'll say
position will be relative because on
these small elements we will position
them
absolutely. So that's why we are saying
this is the position of relative. Then
we can go ahead update our labels. We'll
say select every single label just say
display of block. Then we would like to
say something like margin bottom of 5
pixels. Then we can say color will be
updated to 555. And font weight could be
a bit bold. Here we go. Then I'll select
my
inputs. I'll say border will be 2
pixels. It'll be solid. and then hash
value of f0 bunch of times. All right.
Then we can say the border radius will
be four pixels. We could say display
will be block. Here we go. Then we can
say width will be
100%. Then padding of let's say 10
pixels. And on the input element I'll
say font size will be 14 pixels. And
finally the transition will be on the
border color with 0.3 seconds. So this
is what we have. Let's go ahead add the
focus state. I'll say input. If it is
focused go ahead say there is not going
to be any outline but we would like to
change the border color which is going
to be 34 98 dB. Okay let's try to focus
on it. As you can tell, the border color
will change. And then I'd like to select
the small element. So here I'll say
small. The visibility will be hidden by
default. And I'll explain just in a
second or actually let me do it
immediately. So when we have an error,
so I'll refresh. So by default it is
invisible, right? We don't have any
content. But if we cut something, if we
have some errors, it'll be visible. So
this is exactly what we're doing. By
default, it'll be uh not visible but
then in a couple of minutes we will say
visibility will be visible. I hope that
makes sense. Then we can position this
absolutely to uh let's say bottom minus
80 pixels or 18 pixels and the left of
zero. Then finally we can decrement the
font size to be 12 pixels. Now I'll just
save this file. Let's take a look at the
end result. I'll try to visit the
index.html. And here on the very first
input, I'll say on the first small
element, I'll say username is
required. Let's save. Now, it is not
really visible because of this line.
Let's delete it. It's right here as you
can tell. Okay. And these errors will be
added dynamically from our JavaScript
code. And after the small element, we
can select our button and style it. I'll
say select the button. I'll say cursor
will be pointer. Then we could say
background color is going to be this
exact same value that we had above. The
primary blue button. We don't really
want any borders. So I'll say border of
none. Color could be white. Let's save.
This is what we have. Now we're going to
give the display of block. And then
we'll say font size could be oops let's
say font size will be
1m. Then we can give some margin top of
let's say 20 pixels. And most
importantly the padding of 12 pixels
from all directions. And let's say
border
radius border dash radius will be let's
say 4 pixels. If you wanted to you can
increment it. And I'll say width will be
100%. It'll take the entire width and
finally the transition will be added on
the
background dash color with 0.3 seconds.
Let's go ahead and say button if it is
on the hover
state. We'll update the background color
to be this value which is going to be
B9. Okay, it is this dark blue value. So
the only thing we left is the error and
success states. And let me once again
demonstrate this pretty quickly. If we
have an error on username, the error
class will be added right here. Right?
If we have an error on email, it'll be
added right here. So just keep this in
mind. But if it is successful, it would
be success. Okay? With this in mind,
let's see how we can update our states.
I'll just say form group dot error
without any spaces because it'll be in
the same element. And then I'll say
select the input element. Go ahead
update the border color to be this error
color which is
E74
C3C. Okay. And maybe we can just
duplicate this and update this to be
form group but success case. We're going
to give a green color like
2E
C71. And then finally on the error case.
So I'll say form group dot error. We're
going to select the small element and
we'll say
visibility will be visible and we would
like to update the color to the exact
same error color. Okay. So that's the
entire CSS file that we would need. Now
we're going to jump into the JavaScript
file and get started with the
functionalities. So the first thing we
would like to do is get our DOM elements
and for this I have prepared a GitHub
gist that you can find the link in the
description. So go ahead find the form
validator MD and basically copy this
entire elements that you have seen.
We're going to get into this in a
second. For now just ignore that. All
right. So we got the form, we got the
username, email, password, as well as
the confirm password inputs. The first
thing we would like to do is add an
event listener on the form. So I'll say
add event listener which will be
listening for the submit event and we'll
say once we got that go ahead and handle
it within this function. So we're going
to take the event as we have talked
about it in a previous project. The very
first thing you would like to do is say
e.prevent prevent default, right? So, we
don't really want this page to be
refreshed. So, if you don't add this and
if you say like submit this form, it is
going to refresh the page. So, just
notice how it's going to refresh it. But
if you add this line, it's not going to
refresh that, right? And then the very
first thing you would like to check if
all the fields have been filled in,
right? So when you just say register
developers check will be just to check
if any of these fields are empty right.
So let's say con is
required valid. You can call this
anything but this is the name that I'll
have and we're going to call a method
called check
required. And this is a method that
we're going to create. Let's say
function check required. Now this will
take an array. Let's say we're going to
put the username, email, basically all
of our inputs, password, as well as the
confirm password. So, we're going to
pass this as an array so that it's a lot
more comfortable to handle it. Can we
just minimize this? It's already
minimized. Oops. Okay, I'll just leave
it here. All right. So, we just sent
this array that we're going to check
within the method in a really, really
easy way. So I'll just say get the input
array and we'll basically run a for each
on this input on the input array. So
first I'll say let is valid that will be
equal to true. So by default we will
think that it is valid but we will
update it. Let's say input array for
each for every single input we are going
to run this method. So I'll say if input
do
value trim. So we're going to trim this
down. And if it is equal to an empty
string that means it is invalid. We
would like to throw an error. So I'll
say show error. And this is a method.
Once again we are going to build and
this will take two different arguments.
So the first one is the input itself. So
we need to say which input has an error.
Let's say you filled this in. You filled
this
in but you did not fill these right.
Okay. So the show error will be run on
these inputs. And this is exactly what
we are passing. I'll say the input so
that it knows which input to show the
error. And then we will say like the
message here I'll say something like is
required. But what is required right? Is
it password? Is it confirm password for
this? We can say the input
itself. But now if you put it like this,
this will look kind of not formatted. So
it will say something like password is
required. But we want what we want to do
is take the very first letter and
capitalize it. So this is what we would
like to have. So for this I will create
a method that will format the input.
I'll cut this for a second. I'll say get
field name. Let's say input. This will
basically format
it. Let's create that method. And let's
actually call this as a format field
name so that our code is a lot more
readable. And I'll paste this method.
It's super simple. And I even added some
comments. So if the input ID is equal to
username, it'll take that and capitalize
the very first letter. So this is how we
do it. We'll say input do ID get the
first character and uppercase it and
then put the rest as it is. I hope this
makes sense. Now this is working
properly. Now that we got an error,
we'll say is valid is equal to false.
But in the else case, we can show a
success message. Let's say show success.
And this is another method that we're
going to build. And of course we need to
pass the input so that we know on which
input we will display the success
message. And at the very end we'll say
return is valid because at the end of
the day from this method we are
expecting a boolean value that is either
true or false. And just before we move
on, let's build the other functions that
we would need which is going to be the
function of show
error as well as the
success. Okay, in the show error method,
we'll get the input as well as the
message as the argument. Then we would
like to select the form group. Let's say
form group that will be
input.
[Music]
element. Now why are we selecting the
parent element? Because if you have the
input like if you have the input you
would like to go into the parent element
which is the form group and as I said
previously we're going to add the error
class right here or the success class
right. So that's why we are selecting
the parent element that will be equal to
form group. Then we can add a class
name. I'll say uh class
name that will be equal to form
group plus it'll be the error right you
cannot just say error only. This will
delete the form group and add only the
error. I hope that makes sense. So we'll
add both of these. Then we can say con
get the small
[Music]
element. I'll say form
group query
selector. We'll just get the small
element and update the text content.
Right? I'll say small. You can also say
inner
text is equal to this message. So that's
it for this method. And let's hand
handle
the test case. we'll get the input.
Let's get the form group in the exact
same way. And for the class name, we
will say success instead of
error. Okay, so that's it because in
this in the success case, we don't
really add any messages as you can tell.
So with this, maybe we can give it a go.
Let's see if it'll work or not. As you
can tell, this is the demo application
that we have and we are getting all
these fields with some errors. Let's
fill them in. Okay, it is valid. We
display the success feedback but error
on the other ones. Now that was the only
the first half. We have other things to
do. Let's just fill this in pretty
quickly. I'll say gmail.com. Now this is
also a valid email, right? So maybe this
the provider
is.gm.com. So this is completely a fine
email format. Then we can say from 1 to
six. And I'll just say from one to six
on this one, but let's just say only two
letters. Okay, so this is one of the
other checks that we need to keep in
mind. Username must be at least three
characters. And let's put this back. But
now this is invalid. This is another
check that we're going to have in our
code. Now let's put three uh or maybe
just one. It doesn't really matter.
It'll say it should be at least six
characters. And then we will finally
check for the like if the passwords are
matching or not. We have four additional
checks that we need to add. I'll scroll
to the top. So that was for the require
required fields. We would like to create
a variable for is form valid. This will
be equal to is required valid initially
but we will update this in a second.
I'll say if is required valid we would
like to check for the other things. I'll
say con is username
valid and we're going to call a method
to check the length. So we'll say check
the username. The minimum value could be
three and the maximum could be 15. So if
you try to add something more than 15
characters here, we can see this is
another error that we have. And then we
will have another check. Let's say cost
is email valid. And we're going to call
the check email function where we would
like to check for the email that user
just typed in. And then let's duplicate
this one. It'll be is
password valid.
We will check for the
length. Let's say check for the
password. Minimum could be six and the
maximum could be 25. Okay. Finally, we
will duplicate this and we'll say
check
passwords
match and we will check like we will
compare both of these values which is
the password as well as the confirm
password. And for the variable name we
could say
is passwords
match. Okay. Now we need to create all
these methods one by one. So let's
scroll to the bottom and try to build
it. First I'll shrink every single
function that we have so that it's
easier to build. I'll say function check
length where we'll take the
input as well as the minimum and maximum
values. So the very first if check will
be this one. If
input do value length if it is less than
the minimum value. In this case we would
like to show an error. Let's say show
error called the method on this input
whatever that is. And then we'll say
uh something like must be at
least minimum
characters. And let's put the money
sign. And finally, whatever the input
is, but we would like to format it just
like what we have done previously. So
we'll say format field name. And we're
going to pass the input as the
argument. Okay. And we're just going to
return false from this method from this
call. Now this will be equal to false if
we hit this if check. And then else if
we have the maximum case input do
value length if it is greater than the
maximum
value I'll basically get the exact same
thing but we'll say it must be let's say
less
than maximum
characters and then return false but
else that means everything went
successfully. So we can say show success
on this input and return
true. Okay. So that's the very first
method that we would need. The other one
will be to check email. So here I'll
just put it right here. Let's say
function check email where we'll take
the email and handle the method. Now
we're going to be using a regular
expression. If you don't know what that
is, I can give you an example. So the
first thing I'd like to do visit that
GitHub chest and I'll copy this email
regular expression. So let's go ahead
and copy this and we're going to test
this out right now. Okay, I'll just open
up my terminal or the console I should
say. I'll paste this in. So this is a
regular expression that will check if an
email is valid or not. So let's paste
this in. We have this variable. Now we
can say email regular
expression. Okay, let's get this one and
we'll say test and we can test anything.
Let's say a.com is it an email or not?
Obviously it is not. So it'll return
false. Let's put something correct. I'll
say gmail.com. But let's say
john@gmail.com. Okay, this is equal to
true. So here we can see this is not
valid. It'll return false. And this is
valid. it'll give you true. So this is
what we have. This is really easy to
build with regular expressions. And just
before we move on, if you delete this
part and tell me to type this out,
honestly, I cannot do it and I don't
have to and you don't have to neither.
So this is something that you would
mostly get from you know online or you
would get it with AI. So okay, just keep
that in mind if this looks complicated.
Maybe you are thinking how do I memorize
this? How do I learn this? absolutely
not needed. Then we'll go ahead say if
basically what we have done in the
terminal I'll say email reax test and
we'll basically test the email. So we'll
say email
value trim if this is equal to like uh
like okay sorry this will return you
either true or false. If this is true
then we can show a success message. But
if it is equal to false that means we
need to show an error in the else case.
Here I'll say show the error. And here
we'll just call the show success method.
And I'll pass the input and then here
we'll pass the input as well as the
message. Here we'll say email is not
valid. Here we go. then we can return
false from here
and true within this if within this if
check. Okay, so that's going to be it
for the check email method. The very
last one that we need is the check
passwords match function. That's going
to be super simple. Let's go ahead and
paste it. Um this will take the input
one as well as the input two. Here I'll
say if input one
value is not equal to input two
value. In this case we're going to show
an error. This is the input two that
we're going to show the error and we'll
say
passwords do not match and then we can
say return false. But if this is not the
case, we'll just say return
true. Okay, now that we got all these
methods, we can move on with this uh if
check where we need to just update this
variable, right? I'll go ahead and say
is form valid. And by the way, I have a
typo. This should be valid at the end. I
was just missing ad. So we'll say is
form valid will be equal to if
user name valid and we'll just basically
chain all of these within and check. So
if every one of them is equal to true,
form is
valid. Otherwise, we're going to get
false. Okay, here we go. And then
outside of this if we'll say if is form
valid we would like to say alert
registration
successful okay but uh not but and I was
going to say we'll say
formreset okay it should be reset like
this we'll basically delete the input
elements and finally we can remove the
success classes I'll say document
doquery select Selector all select every
single form
group and we'll say for each we can get
every single group
element. Let's say
group and we'll say group.class name
will be equal to only form group. Right?
Previously we had this success as well
but we would like to delete it and have
this have this one only. Now let's save.
Everything should be working as
expected. Let's go ahead and test this
out. I'll leave everything empty. We got
our errors. Let's put the correct
values. Like I'll just say Joe at the
end. I mean at the beginning I'll say
john@gmail.com. I'll say 1 2 3 1 2 3.
Okay. Why is this? Did
we Okay. Let's see. Type should be
password. Okay. And now if you type in
it's not going to be visible. Let's type
this out once again. I'll say Joe
John@gmail.com 1 2 3 1 2 3. So we got an
error which which says username must be
at least three characters. Let's say
John and have another
error. So we should got an error but
looks like we didn't. What are we
missing in our code? Let's take a look
at it. So I just realized here in this
method we are getting the email but I
accidentally put the input. So this
should be email and this should be also
email. If you wanted to you can call
this as input and make those input as
well but this is what I'll have. Let's
try to test this out once
again. I'll put the invalid one and 1 2
3. Now let's see. So email is not valid
and this should be at least six
characters. Let's put the correct one.
Okay, now this is success. But this is
not really success. Let's say 456. Now
they do not match. Let's put the correct
one. Register. Now we got the alert and
then everything has been resetted and we
got rid of these success uh success
classes. So with that, that's going to
be it for this entire project where we
have built a form validator with the
register
um register form. And I have a typo.
Let's fix
[Music]
it. Okay, this is what we should have.
And that's going to be it for this
project. I'll see you in the next one.
All right, welcome back. In this
section, we're going to build a password
generator application. This is the end
result. Let's take a look at it how that
work and then we'll jump into the code.
Now this is such a classic application
but it's really helpful that will teach
you a bunch of different concepts. Okay.
So this is the end result. When you
first refresh you will get a random
password by default and if you wanted to
you can create more. So I can update the
length. It'll be generated and as you
can tell now it is completely strong.
But if I wanted to not include the
uppercase letters I can uncheck this.
And now I will never have any uppercase
letters in this password. And I can do
it for the lowerase. And as I deselect
them, the uh the strength will
decrement. Now let's go with medium. As
you can tell, now this is still medium,
but it says you should select at least
one of those, right? So let's go with
this one. And I'll take the length to be
six. So at minimum, we can go with six.
And maximum could be 24. Now this is
weak. Okay. And finally, let's generate
another one. I'll say copy this. It has
been copied. Let's try to paste it. As
you can tell, this is exact same value
that we have. So, this is the end
result. If you wanted to have these
screenshots, you can find the link in
description for these diagrams. It's
completely free. Um, if you wanted to
just challenge yourself and build it uh
by yourself, these are the screenshots
that you can take a look. All right. So,
I'll try to shrink this window. And as
always, I have my second window, which
is VS Code with an empty folder. We have
three different empty files. First,
we'll get started with the HTML file.
Okay, let's go ahead and generate the
boiler plate. I'll say uh put the title,
password generator, and then I'd like to
link my CSS file.
And finally, I would like to get the fav
icon uh I'm sorry, font awesome for
these icons. So, I'll go ahead to say
cdnjs font awesome. Let's search for it
and get the link. I think this would
work. Let's copy
it and then we will put it as the link
tag under the head. Okay. Right here.
Now we should be able to use the uh
icons the yeah icons coming from font
awesome. The very first thing I'd like
to do create my
container and then within this we are
going to put the h1. Let's say
password
generator. Okay. Right after this h1 we
would like to put the container which
will be this one where we have the
password itself and then the button. So
I'll go ahead create a container called
password dash container. So we're going
to make this to be flex and then we will
say justify content will be space
between right. Okay. Here I'll say
create an input that is type of text but
this is only read only. Okay. So you
cannot really type anything in it is
read only value and we can give it an ID
like
password. And finally we will have the
icon. I'll say I and we can say class uh
class will be f a r f a copy which is
coming from font awesome. Okay. Then we
can give it a title. Let's say
copy-bn and then a title itself. So that
when you hover over this you would be
able to see this title that says copy to
[Music]
clipboard. Now let's see what do we
have. I'll say open with live server and
we'll get the warning as always. But
here we go. This is what we have. Icons
are working correctly. And you cannot
type something in. I'm I'm pressing some
some keys in my keyboard. It does not
type. Okay. The other thing that we
would like to build is our options. So
right after the password container, I'll
go ahead add a comment. Let's say
options. And I can even say password
container
container. All right. So under the
options I'll have the options class.
Then we'll have the password length at
first. I'll add comments. You don't
really have to, but this is really
convenient if you are following along
with the source code. I'll say dot
option. So the very first option we'll
have is the password length. So I'll add
a label. Let's say this is for the
length and let's say password length. So
we just created the label. Now let's
create the range container. Now this
will be a container because we do not
only have the input but also we have the
value output. So I'll say range dash
container and I'll say the very first
one will be input that is a type of
range right and then we can say id will
be a length then finally we will say
minimum value maximum value and then the
value itself so at minimum as I said we
could have six maximum could be 24 and
by default it'll be 12 so I'll say
minimum six 24 as the maximum minimum
and the default value will be 12. So
whenever you move this around, this
would be updated from our JavaScript
code. This is a bit later in the video.
And then we can have the span tag that
will hold the value. By default, it is
12. And we can say ID length dash
value. All right. So this is the very
first option that we have. Right after
this one, we would like to create the
include uppercase option. So I will add
my
[Music]
comment and then we'll have the option
class right within this div we will have
the label that will be for the uppercase
and text will be include
uppercase we'll have the input this will
be type of checkbox and then we can say
ID will be
uppercase finally we'll say this would
be checked by default okay let's save.
To get this formatting, I'd like to copy
this entire thing. This would be for the
include lowerase. So, I'll say command D
couple of times and just say uh lower
case. Here we go. Then let's copy this
once again. Duplicate it. This would be
for the include numbers and then
symbols. Let's duplicate this twice.
I'll say this would be numbers. So, I
just paused the video and put them in.
This is the numbers and then the
symbols. It's the exact same thing that
we have above, but basically we change
the ID and then the text as well as the
label for attribute. All right, let's
save and take a look at the output. This
is what we got. We're going to be
changing the colors a bit later in the
video, but now it is time to add the
button as well as this container for the
password strength. Okay, so let's move
on. Now, what you would like to do, go
ahead, scroll to the top, shrink the
options container because we'll go
outside. And we're going to create a
button that will hold the text that says
generate
password. And just before just before
this text, we'll click to add an icon.
I'll say class will be equal to
fasa dash key. And we can give it a id.
And we can give it an ID to this button
that will be
generate
dashbtn. And finally, we're going to put
the strength meter. Right, I'll save to
get this formatting. Right below to this
button, I'll say
strength dash
container. And we're going to have a p
tag that will say
password
strength. Okay. Now, as you can tell,
this value will be dynamic, right? And
the styling is a little bit different.
I'm not really sure if you're if you can
see it, but it is font font weight of
bold. So, we would like to select this
with a span tag. So, I will say still
within the P tag, but it will be under a
span tag. I'll say medium. You can call
this anything because we will update
it. But let's go with medium. And then
I'll add an ID. Let's say strength dash
label.
Okay, finally we're going to put the
strength meter container that you can
see. So this one is the container and
this is the value itself. So still under
this strength container depth I will
have strength dash meter. This is the
container that we have and then
strength dashbar. Now this value will be
updated from our JavaScript code. For
now it'll be empty completely. Right?
Let's take a look at the output. So this
is what we have. We don't really see
anything for the strength meter, but we
will update it once again. Okay, so
that's going to be for the HTML file.
Just before we end this section, above
the body, I'll put script source of
script.js. Now we can close this file
with command w and then just open up the
style. CSS file and get started with it.
Now, it's been a while since we haven't
used any external phone families. So
let's go ahead and install something.
I'll say command shiftp and we're going
to say insert CSS import and let's go
with monerat at this case in this case.
All right, we got the import. Now let's
put our basic reset and like if this did
not work in your case, you should visit
the extensions tab and get the Google
fonts as we have explained previously.
So once you install this, then you
should be able to search for it with
command shiftp. All right. So, we're
going to select everything and I'll say
margin of zero, petting of zero, box
sizing of border box and let's say font
family will be monat that we have just
imported and we can fold this back with
sans serif. Now, what I'd like to do
select body and just say minimum height
will be 100 ph. We'll say display of
flex let's say
DF JCC right justify content centered
align item centered color could be
333 and then we can say padding will be
pixels okay so everything has been let's
say centered in the middle of the screen
and I'm just too much zoomed in this is
what we have now in this section I'd
like to use what we call CSS variables
You're going to see it's really cool and
easy to get started with. Now I'll
create it. This is how we would do it.
We would say colon root and then you can
create anything that you wish. So we're
going to put primary
color and let's add it to be 2B
76. Now why are we creating this? So let
me let me just showcase it pretty
quickly with an example. Now let's say
you have really large CSS file.
Basically you have a button. Let's say
you're selecting a button. Let's say you
select the
label so on and so forth. You select
your cards and in all of them you would
say something like color and you would
use this
value. Let's say you got this value and
you did the same thing for all of them.
But now some of your friends told you
that this color is not really good. go
ahead and update it with this one. Now,
what you would like to do, copy this
form here and update it on every single
places, right? And if you imagine like
you have 100 instances, you have to just
scroll to the bottom and update every
single one of them, which is not really
acceptable, right? You definitely don't
want to do something like this. So,
instead, if you used, let's say, CSS
variables, I'll do Ctrl + Z, get the
exact same value. Okay, just
imagine you are using the CSS variable.
So instead of this you would say v and
use the primary color. Now if you do the
same thing for all of them. Let's put
it. Okay. Now this is how your code
looks like and your friend told you that
this color doesn't look really nice. You
should update it with this one. Now all
you have to do only update this part
because every single one of these are
using the same color right it's been
updated here here and on this one and
let's say on the next 100 instances I
hope this makes sense this is why most
of the time you would like to use CSS
variables it is really useful all right
now the first primary color that we'll
have is this one as we just had now I'll
put couple of different colors such as
the secondary one. Let's say the weak
color that's going to be this
one. Okay. And like basically this is
the primary color, the secondary color,
weak, and we would like to add the
medium as well as the strong colors. So
I'll go ahead copy and paste. We can
pause the video, type this
out. Here we go. We got five different
colors and we'll be using them a lot
within this CSS file. So what I'd like
to do just say background color will be
linear grad gradient and just a quick
correction if you're going to be using
linear gradient it has to be background
so if you put background color it's not
going to work so this is something to
keep in mind and then we're going to put
the degree let's say 45° you can update
it this is the one that I'll be using
and then we'll be using our primary and
secondary colors so just like we have
used a couple of minutes ago I'll a var
get the primary color. We'll go from
this one to the secondary
one. Okay, now let's save. Take a look
at it. This is the output. Now, if you
wanted to change this secondary color,
all you have to do visit this part and
put something else and your document
would be updated. Any place that you use
the secondary color has now been updated
to this value. Okay, I hope that makes
sense. So, that's going to be it for the
body. We're going to go ahead and update
the container
class. Let me just scroll down a little
bit. Okay. So, we're going to put the
background color. Let's say it'll be
white. FFF. Here we go. Then we can say
petting will be
2.5 RM. And then we can add some rounded
corners. I'll say 1 RM. Can say box
shadow. That will be 0 to 10 pixels to
30 pixels.
and then RGBA of let's
say like the black
uh 15. Okay. So, it's subtle but I think
it's looking nice. If you wanted to, you
can increase it. This is the one. This
is the value that that I'll have. I'll
say width will be
90%. And we'll say the maximum width
could be 450 pixels. Now, let's select
H1. I'll say text align would be
centered. We can say margin bottom will
be 1.8 RM. Then we can say color will be
the primary
color. Here we go. Then we can say font
size will be 1.8 RM as we can tell.
We'll say font weight will be 700. So
it's bold. Um I'll say position will be
relative. I'll tell you why. And then
we'll say petting bottom will be
0.5
RM. So this is what we got. We'll be
using the position relative because
right now we'll use uh the after sudo
element to be able to give this
underline. So here I'll go ahead say h1.
Let's grab the after pseudo element. As
always you have the content as empty.
Even if like if you want this to be
displayed, this should be empty. Or like
if you if you're going to put something,
it'll be there, right? But if you're
using it for only decoration purposes,
just like what we have here, you would
leave it empty. I hope that makes sense.
Now, we'll say position will be absolute
and the parent is relative. So, we're
going to say the bottom will be
zero. And then we can say from the left,
it'll be 50%. Let's say if this is what
we got nothing but if we add width we
should able to see something or maybe
height as
well. Okay. Why cannot we see anything.
Maybe it doesn't have the background
color. So currently it is right here but
it is invisible. Let's say background
color will be red. Here we go. By
default the background color is white.
So that's why you cannot see it. So,
I'll go ahead at the background to be
the same linear gradient that we have
above. I'll copy
this and paste it right here. Let's
change the degree to be
90°. Okay. But now this is not centered.
We would like to take it 50% back. I'll
say after the left I'll say
transform translate X will be equal to
minus
50%. Here we go. Now it is centered
completely and we can say border radius
could be like 2 pixels. So this is one
way of creating the the underline. If
you wanted to you can create a different
element right after the h1 like you
could create a div and then give it a
class and then style it. But this is
also a pretty valid option. Right of
right after the h1 we will update the
password container. I'll go ahead and
select
[Music]
it and we'll say the margin bottom will
be
2M. Here we go. We'll say background
color could be this which will be F8 F8
FC. Then we'll say border radius will be
10 pixels. We can add the border itself
one pixel solid and this value which
will be E2 E8
F0. Here we go. And then let's say we
will have the overflow of
hidden. And then I'll add a tiny box
shadow just like this one. If you don't
want to, you can delete it. But this is
what I'll have. And then let's say
display flex align items would be
centered. And as and as I said
previously, the justify content will be
space between. Here we go. Then we'll go
ahead say petting. let's say zero 1m and
zero for both of the values. So what we
have just done is to add some paddings
to the right hand side. Right? So if you
delete it, this is how that look. But if
you add it, here we go. Now we would
like to select the password
itself and we'll say with will be 100%.
Then we'll say petting will be
1.1m. Here we go. We'll say heading
right will be 50 pixels. Let's say no
borders and the background could be
transparent. Here we go. And then we'll
say color will be this grayish color or
a
5568. And then we can say the letter
spacing will be one pixel. And then
finally outline of none as well as the
border radius of 10
pixels. 10 pixels. Here we go. Now we
don't have anything inside. That's why
we cannot see it. But if we got the
index.html, let's try to add something
in like it is the input. Let's say value
will be hello. Okay. This is how that
look.
Now we can move on with the copy button
itself. Let's say select the copy
button. It was
copy-bn and we'll say cursor will be
pointer. Then we'll say the color will
be this one
71 80 96. Now, if you wanted to, you can
create those as the CSS variables, but
since this is a value that we don't
really use too much, I'll leave it as a
hard-coded color. But definitely, it is
your choice if you wanted to add it
right here or
not. Okay. Right after the color, I'll
have my font size to be 1.1 RM. Then,
we'll go ahead say background or for
now, let's say width to be 35 pixels.
I'll duplicate this. Height will be 35
pixels as well. This is what we got. Now
we can say display
flex. Oops. Let's try to fix
it. Okay. I'll say display
flex align item centered. And let's say
justify content centered as well. Here
we go. And then I'll say border radius
will be
50%. Then we can add the hover state.
I'll say copy
button on the hover state. We could say
color will be equal to the uh the
primary variable the primary color. As
you can tell it has been updated. Now we
could also get into the options. I'll
just scroll a little bit and then have
the options selected. So I just selected
the options. Now we'll say margin bottom
will be tom. Here we go. We'll say
background will be updated to be F8 FA
FC to this grayish color. And then we'll
say padding could be 1.5 RM from all
directions. Border radius will be let's
say border radius will be 10
pixels. Here we go. And then we'll say
box shadow. It'll be really tiny but
still I'd like to add
it. Here we go. Like it's really really
tiny. Maybe it is not visible from the
video but I can definitely see it. Then
we'll go ahead select every single
option. So we'll say display will be
flex justify content space between let's
save. Here we go. We'll say align items
centered. And finally margin bottom of 1
RM. Okay. Now the problem here is that
the very last one also got some margin
bottom. We don't we don't really want to
have it right. It is not needed because
there is no element right after this
one. So we can remove that by saying
option dot or sorry option colon last
child. So we're going to select the last
child and we'll say margin bottom will
be zero. Here we can see it's been
updated. So this is another trick that
you can keep in mind for these
situations. And then I'll say dot option
where we'll get the label itself. And
we're going to say font size could be
something like
0.9m it's been updated. We can say color
will be let's say 4 a this value. So
once again if you wanted to you can take
this and make it a CSS variable. I'll
just skip that. We'll say font weight
will be 500. Here we go. Then we can
select the range container itself. And
then we're going to say display of flex
align items would be centered and gap of
10 pixels. Let's save like I think we
cannot see the difference for now
because it is in these smaller screens.
But now let's try to put it I'll just
put that
and I think I should put them side by
side to be able to see it. Now I will
save. Okay. So as you can tell there are
some differences. If we delete the gap
or if we add it, this is now a lot more
visible. Now let's go ahead and change
the width itself. I'll say this will be
width of
60%. Here we go. Now let's say I'd like
to select this input specifically which
is type of range. How can I do it? I'll
say input where the type is equal to
range. Right? And then I'd like to
change this color which is called the
accent color. I'll say this will be the
primary color that we have. Here we go.
And then I can say the height could be
something like 5 pixels. It's been
updated. If you wanted to you can change
it to be 50. I don't know what is the
maximum
value but let's go with one pixels. It's
really tiny. I'll go with five pixels.
Then you can say something like cursor
will be pointer as well.
And finally I'll just say flex of
one. Okay. Now what I'll be doing is to
select the checkbox itself. So it's the
exact same thing but type will be
different. Let's say checkbox and on the
checkbox I'll say width will be 20
pixels and same for the height. Let's
save. Here we go. It's been incremented
a bit. Now I'll say border will be 2
pixels solid. And I'd like to give the
variable of primary color. Now it's not
been updated, right? And for this we can
say appearance will be
none. Now as you can tell it's just it
got updated. If you delete that, it will
not. But this is the like this is the
style that make it work. Then we'll say
border radius will be 4
pixels. Here we go. And I'll say cursor
will be pointer. and I'll say outline
will be
none. So for now that's going to be for
the checkbox. We will update it just in
a second. For now I'd like to select the
exact same element and we're going to
update the checked state. Okay. So if it
is checked what do we want this to
happen? I'll say the background color
will be equal to the primary color that
we have. Now let's save and give it a
go. Every one of them is checked, right?
because this is what we said in in the
default state. Let's see. Uh all of them
are checked as you can tell although
they include uppercase. Now this is not
checked by default but we would like to
have this checked uh immediately. If you
click to it now it is unchecked. Right
now we we don't really want to have the
background itself. We also want to have
the check mark icon. Right? For this
we'll go into the checked state and we
will update the after pseudo element. So
I'll say checked and get the after
pseudo
element where we would like to add the
content. Now we'll be using a uni code
character that will be backslash put it
into a string back
slash2714. Now let's save. What are we
going to get? As you can tell this is
what we have but it is not really
centered. So I'll say position will be
absolute but for this to work we should
say the checkbox itself will be position
relative and then I can say color will
be
white and then we can now center this
correctly. I'll say from the left let's
go 50%. From the top let's go 50%. And
if you think this will center it I'm
sorry it would not. You have to use this
trick where you would say transform
where the translate the x direction will
be minus 50 and then from the let's say
in the y direction we'll also do
50% minus 50% it should be. So we
basically updated the x and y values.
Now it is being centered correctly. Then
I can update the font size. Let's say
it'll be 12 pixels. Here we go. Now one
more thing that I'd like to do which is
there is no animation like no transition
at all. It happens immediately. For this
we can go right here under the checkbox.
I'll say transition. Let's go a bit uh
extreme. I'll say 1
second. Like it's happening really
slowly but most of the time you'll click
to go with a value like 0.3 seconds.
I think this looks a lot more cleaner.
All right. So that's going to be for the
after element itself. Now we can get the
length
value. So I will select the length
value. Let's go ahead say font weight
will be 600. We can get the color that
will be primary color. Here we go. And
then we'll say width will be 30 pixels.
Then we would like to say the text align
would be centered.
Then we can update the background color
that will be equal to this value as you
can tell. Then I'll just say border
radius will be 4 pixels. Here we go.
It's a little bit rounded. Now I'd like
to add some paddings. Finally, we'll say
padding 2 pixels to 5 pixels. All right.
Now we're going to go ahead and select
our button that we would like to update.
So I'll say width will be
100%. Then we would like to say petting
will be 1 RM from all directions. And
then I'll add a background that will be
linear gradient just like what we have
done above. This is the exact same
thing. Let's save. Here we go. I'll say
color will be equal to white. We can say
border will be
none. Border radius will be 10
pixels. Then we can say font size will
be updated to 1 RM. Then we can say font
weight will be 600. Here we go. It's a
little bit more bold. Then we'll say
cursor will be
pointer. Now I'll give some transitions.
So I'll just say all 0.3 seconds so that
we can have the hover state happening a
bit more smoothly. Then margin bottom of
1.5 RM. Finally, finally I'll just give
some box shadow that is tiny but it'll
just give this kind of effect.
I think it looks a lot more cleaner if
we have the box shadow. Now we're going
to go ahead and update the hover state.
I'll say button on hover. We would like
to basically have a
transform field. I'll say translate of Y
will be minus 2 pixels. And then I think
that that could be it for the hover
state. All right. So this is the output
that we have. And then after the hover
state, we will add the active state
where we will update the translate Y to
be resetted. All right. Now we would
like to get the strength
container. And I'll say margin top will
be 0.8 RM. Then we would like to select
the P tag within this strength
container. So I will update the font
size to be 0.9 RM. And then we can
update the color to be this value that
you see on the screen. And then we'll
say margin bottom of 0.6 RM. Here we go.
And then I'll say display of flex. Then
finally we'll say justify content space
between just like this so that they have
some spacing uh between them. And lastly
I'd like to say font to weight to be
500. So it's a little bit more bold. All
right. Now, we're going to go ahead and
get the strength dash label. And I have
a typo. Let's say
strength label. I'd like to say the
color will be primary color. So, we'll
say variable. Here we go. Now, there
isn't that much of a change, but it is
this element. So, if you say red, so
this is the one that we have actually
updated. And then I'll say font weight
will be 600. Now it's a bit more even
bolder than this one. Now I'll select
the strength
meter. Then we'll say height will be 10
pixels. Then I'd like to say the
background color will be updated to
EDF 27 sorry 2F7. It should be like
this. Then I'll say border radius is
going to be 5 pixels. Then we would like
to say margin bottom will be margin top
actually will be 0.5 RM and I'll say
overflow would be
hidden. Finally we can give some box
shadows. I'd like to copy and
paste. Here we go. Now we just said
insert and as you can tell it is like
inwards right? It is insert. If you
delete that it would be outside.
But now it is set into the container
itself. Now we will get the strength bar
itself. So I'll say bar and height could
be 100%. It'll take the entire
container. We'll say width will be zero
initially. Right? And then we can say
minimum width will be
5%. Now we can add a background color.
I'll say
variable. You can use any color. I'll go
with the weak one. I'll say weak color.
Here we go. And then we'll say
transition is going to be all 0.3
seconds. And we'll say ease. Now
transition is needed to have this
effect. Now this will be strong. Notice
how it'll transition
smoothly. Here we go. Just take a look
at it now. Okay. So this is happening
thanks to this transition that we have.
And we can add some border radiuses. So
I'll say border radius that will be
equal to 5 pixels. Okay, now it is
rounded. And at the very end of this
file, I'll have my media query that's
around 10 lines of code. We will update
the container H1 and option label when
we hit this uh this pixels and below.
Okay, let's save. Now it's been
updated, right? So there's like a subtle
change once you hit that break point.
Okay, so that's going to be for the
entire CSS file that we have. Next,
we're going to build the JavaScript. So
the very first thing we would like to do
is get all the DOM elements such as
these checkboxes, the button, the copy
button, the string meter, so on and so
forth. Now we could type them out like
const password input. We would get the
document dot getelement by ID and then
we put the ID. But instead of typing
them out, I have prepared a file. You
can find the GitHub gist link in the
description. Just find the password
generator file. Go ahead, copy
everything that you have seen here. This
is what I'll be doing. I'll just delete
this. Paste this in. Now, these are all
the elements that we'll be using. And
then we have the character sets that
we're going to be using to be able to
include the uppercase letters, lowerase
numbers, and symbols. So these are those
variables that you don't really need to
type them out. All right. So the first
thing I'd like to do is this. If I
update this input, I want this value to
be updated. Right? Currently the value
is 12. Let's open up the HTML file. Um
search for the value. All right. So it
is 12 by default. And here is the text.
We want this to be updated whenever the
value changes. Right?
So this is how we can make that work.
I'll say select the length slider. We're
going to add an event listener which is
the input and then we can run this
function. I'll create an uh I'll create
an arrow function and I'll say length
display text content will be equal to
the value of this. I'll say slider do
value. Now let's see if I update it the
value will be like it'll be updated with
this one right at maximum it could be 24
and at minimum it could be six so that's
the very first thing that we have done
the other thing that we would like to do
is to create a password right if I click
this button I want to generate a
password so I'll say generate button add
event listener which is going to be
click once we clicked it we would like
to call a function called make password
and this is something that we'll create.
So I'll go ahead say
function paste this in and get into the
logic. So the first thing I'd like to do
is get all these variables. So what is
the length that user wants to have if
user wants to include the uppercase
lowerase so on and so forth. So let's
get the length. I'll say it'll be
length length slider do value. Now this
is a type of string. So I'd like to wrap
this with the number class. Now this is
going to be type of number, right? And
then I'll say conclude
uppercase. This will be uppercase
checkbox checked. So either true or or
false. Here we go. We're going to
duplicate this and this will be for the
lowerase checkbox and we'll say include
lowerase. So let's go ahead and update
it. And let's duplicate this. This time
it'll be include the numbers. And I'll
say number um checkbox. Then finally
this will be for the
[Music]
symbols. Include symbols. Okay. Now the
first check we'd like to have is this
one. If user does not select any of
those, we're going to get an alert,
right? Let's go ahead and type this out.
I'll say
if uh like if not include password sorry
if not include uppercase and if not
include lowerase and the rest too. So
I'll just say if this is equal to false
and this is also equal to false which
means it is not checked. In this case we
would like to say
alert please uh select at least one
character
type and then we can just return out of
this function. Don't do anything else.
Let's test this
out. I deselected every single one of
them. Looks like it did not work. Why
this is the case? This should be
not now. Let's
see. Okay, it is working as expected.
But if we have at least one of them
selected, we can go ahead and create a
new password. So I'll say const new
password. And I want to put the logic
into a into another function. I'll say
create random password. So this is a
function that will create and I have a
typo. Let's say random. Now, this will
take the length, right? Let's say this
is the length that we would like to have
in our password. We would like to give
you some couple of different booleans
such as the include
uppercase, let's say include
lowerase, include numbers, and then
finally the symbols. Okay, once we got
the new password, we would like to say
password input do value will be equal to
this newly created password. So we will
update this input that we currently
don't really see, right? Okay, let's
save. Now we'll go ahead create this
function. Okay, let's go here. Let's say
the first thing we'll take is the length
and then we will get those uh variables,
right? You can say something like use
uppercase but I think I'll just go with
the same name like include uppercase
which is equal to true or
false for the
numbers lower case symbols just make
sure they are all in the exact order
that as I have okay now we'll go ahead
and create a variable called all
characters initially this will be equal
to an empty string depending on these
selections we are going to update this
characters. Now let's say if user wants
to include the uppercase letters, we
would like to go ahead and just say all
characters will be equal to or it would
be updated with the uppercase letters.
And then we'll say if they want to
include the lowerase letters, we would
like to do the exact same
thing with the lowerase letters.
Right? Okay. Now since these are just
oneliners, I can delete the curl braces.
This is completely fine and I think this
looks a lot more cleaner. Now let's add
the if check for the last two. I'll say
if include numbers go ahead and update
the all characters variable with it and
then we'll add the symbols. Now if all
of them is equal to true, right? If all
of them are true, if they are checked,
what'll happen in this characters
string? Basically it'll be equal to this
one where we have the first uppercase
letters right it has been added and on
top of it we have added the lowerase
letters then numbers and then finally
these symbols now everything is selected
we're going to go ahead and select
something randomly right so we're going
to get one uppercase letter we're going
to get one lowerase number symbol and
this will happen randomly right but if
user had let's say only uppercase
letters this would be the all characters
variable, right? And then we would
select some values randomly. I hope that
makes sense. Now we'll create a
variable. Let's say let password that
will be equal to an empty string. But
we'll go ahead and update it. So I'll
say for let I is equal to zero. While I
is less than the length, we could say
just increment it by
one. Okay. So we will say password plus
equal to something right and for this we
need to create a random index. So in
every single iteration we're going to
get a random value right and to be able
to select those values we need to get a
random index. So we'll say const random
index and this should be a variable
name. We'll say math do floor. We'll say
math.random. Call the method and we're
going to multiply it by all
characters. Right? Depending on this
length, we're going to get a different
random number and floor this down so
that it is a valid index. And we'll say
password now will be equal to all
characters random index. So here we go.
The password will be updated with the
length whatever that is. And finally we
can return the
password. Okay. Now let's save. Go ahead
try to update this. I'll include
everything. Here we go. This is the
output that we
got. It just works without any issues.
Now I'll just say only include symbols.
This is exactly what we got. Let's say
only
lowerase and some uppercase maybe. Here
we go. So that's going to be for this
method as well. Once we update the UI,
we would like to update the strength
meter as well. And I'll put the logic
into a function. I'll say update
strength meter. Call this with the new
password. Now let's build this method or
the function, however you'd like to call
it. I'll say this will take the new
password.
Now to be able to decide the strength of
the password if it is medium, weak or
strong, we'll be using some numbers
depending on these checkboxes. So if
uppercase included, let's say we will
add additional 15 points. So on and so
forth. Now instead of calling this as
new password, I'll just call it as
password. So it's a little bit more
easier to type out. So the first thing
I'd like to get is the password length.
So we can say it'll be equal to the
password.length.
Then we can check if it has uppercase
letters. Right? I'll say has uppercase.
We are going to say we are going to say
we would like to use a regular
expression. So this is how we can do it.
We'll
say if it has any of these characters
from uppercase A all the way up to Z. In
this case, we're going to go ahead and
test this
out. Test out the password. If this
includes like if this returns true, this
will be equal to true, right? Nob
brainer. Now I'll go ahead duplicate
this. This will be equal to has
lowercase. We'll just say a toz but
lowered. And then let's duplicate it.
This time it'll be numbers. Let's say
from zero all the way up to 9. And we
can say has
numbers. Duplicate it. And I'll say has
symbols.
And instead of typing every single
symbol, I think I can just scroll to the
top, copy this entire string, and paste
this in. Okay, so we got all of
these. It should be like this. Now we'll
say let's calc let's calculate a score
for the password strength, right? I'll
say let strength score. Initially, it'll
be equal to zero and we will increment
it as we go. So let's say first we'll
get started with 40 points, right? I'll
say strength score plus equal to I'll
say math do minimum we'll say password
length* 2 and 40. So basically we are
going to have two different values.
Let's say this is equal to 30. We're
going to get the minimum of them. Now if
this is equal to 300 we're going to get
40, right? So at maximum it could be 40
right if it doesn't really matter if
this is like 3 million we are going to
always get the minimum value which is
40. So that's why I say at maximum it'll
be 40 right so this is something to keep
in mind not only to specific to this
project but if you want to get a value
that is like at maximum right here at
maximum we would like to get 40 that's
why we use the minimum method. So maybe
this is kind of like a quick note that
you can take. If you want to get a
maximum value, you would use the dot
minimum. Right? So I can feel like it
sounds a little bit complicated. That's
why I just put a comment that you can
have in the source code. Here the domin
method will get the minimum value from
these, right? But this will be this will
make sure that at the maximum you would
get 40. I hope I hope this really makes
sense. And then we'll go ahead just add
couple of different if checks. I'll say
if has
uppercase we would like to increment
this strength score let's say strength
score plus equal to 15 I'll duplicate
this three times and I'll say if we have
some
symbols if has
numbers I think this should be
numbers okay and then I'll say has
lowerase
[Music]
So we'll just add additional 15 points
for every single one of these options.
And then we can enforce the minimum
score for very short passwords. I'll say
if
password length is less than 8. I'd like
to run this if check. I'll say strength
score will be equal to math do
minimum strength score and 40. Right?
We're just going to get the 40 depending
on this like thanks to this minimum
method. If this is equal to 100, we
would still get the 40 because length is
less than 8. We want to just enforce the
user, right? I'll say enforce enforce
minimum score for every short password.
All right. Now, we'll go right below to
this if check and I'll get some variable
called save score. And I'd like to add a
comment. Now, why do we need this? So,
basically, I would like to ensure the
width of this strength bar is a valid
percentage. So, we don't really want to
have something like minus 50 or 1,000,
right? It doesn't really matter what
that is. I'd like to just make sure it
is valid, right? So, I'll say math dot
maximum. We'll add either five or we'll
say math dot minimum that will be 100
and strength score. Now let's say this
is equal to 1,000 right we are going to
get the minimum value. So this part will
be equal to 100. Now as you can tell the
safe score will be either five or 100
right it will be always within this
spectrum. Now here we are using maximum
so we're going to get 100. I hope that
makes sense.
Okay, now that we have this variable, we
can say strength bar. Let's select it.
We'll say style. And finally, we'll just
update the width. So, I'll say style do
width will be equal to save score
whatever that is. And we'll just add the
percent at the end because this is some
CSS. We would like to calculate the
width as a percentage. And finally, I
would like to update this text as well
as give a color. Right? This would be
either medium, weak, or something like
strong. So, I'll create two different
variables. I'll say
strength label text that will be equal
that will be equal to an empty string.
And then let bar color will be equal to
an empty string as well. We'll go ahead
say if this is equal to sorry if
strength
score equal to or if it is less than 40
this will be equal to a weak
password. So I'll go ahead and say
something like bar color will be this
red color that will be a hash f c 8181
and then we'll say strength label text
will be equal to weak right and then
let's add the other cases instead of
typing this out I'd like to copy and
paste I just said else if strength score
is less than 70 this will be a medium
password the yellow color as well as the
medium text. Finally, the strong
password. I'll paste this in. Here we
go. And now that we now that we got all
these variables, I'll just go ahead
update the strength bar and then the
color. I'll say strength bar dot
style dot background color will be equal
to this bar color that we have. And same
for the
text. Do I have a typo? Let's say
strength label. Now it seems like we
don't really have this selector. I'll go
ahead scroll to the top and get this
element. So strength label will be this
value that we have. Now let's save and
give it a go. I'll refresh this page.
Let's say generate a password. Here we
can see this is medium. Let's go all the
way up to 24. Now it is strong. It is
working as
expected. Let's go with this
value. Okay, it's medium. Now it is weak
but I think we have kind of like an
error. If we select everything at
maximum it doesn't really fill this in
completely right. So let's see what we
are missing in our code. So I have just
paused the video and find the solution.
Now this has symbols regular expression
is not really correct. Notice how we
have the opening and closing brackets.
We are missing it right here. So first I
would like to add the opening brackets
and then let's go ahead close this off
right here. But still this is not really
valid because here we would like to add
a backslash. Now this should be
completely working out. Again really
weird really complex but this is what we
would like to use with a regular
expression. Right? So I'll go ahead and
save. Now let's give it a go. I'll
maximize this. Select everything. Now it
is 100% as we wish. So I hope that makes
sense. The very last functionality we
left is this copy button. If we click to
it, we want this value to be copied.
Update the UI and after 1.5 seconds like
we have some delays and then it'll go
back to this icon. Right? Let's go ahead
and add it. And just before to it, I
would like to add one more thing. So if
you reload this page, when this page
loads, we don't really get a new
password. So we would like to have this
behavior. Every single time we refresh,
we're going to get a different value. So
it's really easy to build. All we have
to do add an event listener. I'll say
window dot add event listener that is
DOM content loaded. We'll call our
method which is to make a password. Now
let's refresh. Every single time by
default we're going to get a new
password. And then if we wanted to we
can create more and more. Now I'll
create that copy functionality. So I
will go at the very bottom of this file
and I'll say copy button add event
listener which will be the click event.
We would like to call this
function. Now you can create a different
function but I'll just put it in line.
So I'll say first let's add an like
optimization check. I'll say if password
input does not have any values we could
just return don't do anything. Right?
But if we have something we can go ahead
select the clipboard and say write text
into it and the text that we would like
to copy will be password input do value.
Now this will take some time right this
is asynchronous. So we can say then once
this is completed successfully we would
like to show copy
success. Let's call this method. We are
going to create it in a second and if we
got any errors we're going to catch it
with the catch block. So I'll say catch
um you can do anything like displaying
an alert. I'll go with a console log.
Let's say could not
copy and then we we can put the error
message into the
terminal. Okay, let's save and now
create this function. I'll go ahead
create that. It'll be really
simple, really basic. All we have to do
just change the icon. First I'll say
copy button dot class list dot remove.
We are going to remove the classes
coming from font awesome which is this
one as well as fa copy. Now I'll
duplicate this and we would like to add
another one. So we just remove
this. Right? We are going to remove this
and add this check mark which will be
fas and fa check. Also, I'd like to
change the color to be this green one.
So, I'll say copy button style dot color
will be equal to this hash value which
will be
48b78. Okay. Now, let's save and give it
a go. I'll click to it. But now this
will stay just like this forever.
Instead, we would like to update it
after some time. And if you want to add
some delays, you should remember the set
timeout method. So we got our call back
as well as the timeout. Let's say after
1.5 seconds, we'll say copy button class
list. Now remove the check mark,
right? And then I'll duplicate this.
Instead, we would like to add the copy
button
itself, this icon. And then let's update
the color. This will be the default
color. I'll just leave it as an empty
string. Okay, let's save and try to
see. I'll click to it. It's been
updated. And let's see if we got this
value. I'll just paste. Here we go. This
is what we got. Let's generate another
thing. Copy it.
Okay, so it's the exact same value. All
right, so that's going to be it for this
entire project. I hope you enjoyed it
and learn something new from it. I'll
see you in the next one. So in this
section, we are going to build a 2D app.
This is the end result. Let's take a
look at it how that work and we'll jump
into the code to build it from scratch.
So we have an input element where we can
add things, right? I'll say learn
Python. I can either add this by
pressing enter or clicking into this
button. It should be added to the list.
I can delete them and check them as
completed. And we can have some filters.
So I'll just say only show me the ones
that are active and completed ones. If I
say clear the completed, it'll go ahead
to delete all of them. And now we only
have these active ones, right? And the
best thing about this app is that this
data will be saved to the local storage.
So if you go ahead and refresh this
page, it'll still be there no matter
what, right? All right. And you can have
these screenshots from the diagrams. The
link will be in the description just
like any other application that we have.
Okay. So this is the end result. Now
let's go ahead create an empty folder
called to-do app and have our three
different files. They are empty at the
moment, but we're going to build them
one by one. So, let's put them side by
side. So, grab this
and put it just like this. Let's get an
empty HTML file. I'll say this is the
to-do
app. And let's put the link CSS, which
will be style.css. And let's link the
script file. I'll say script.js. JS and
we can put a div that let's say class
name of app. You can call this anything.
This is the name that I'll be going
with. Now we're going to have the header
section which will be this my tasks as
well as today's the date. Now this is
correct. This is not something hardcoded
and I'll show you how we can build it to
be dynamic. Right? So if I open this up
tomorrow, this will say May 6.
and also it'll say Tuesday. So with this
with this in mind, let's go ahead and
put H1. We'll say my tasks. Now the
other thing that we need to add is this
icon. For this, we'll be using font
awesome. So first I'd like to say just
open this up with live
server. We got some warnings, but that's
fine. Here we go. And let's grab the CDN
link. So I'll say
cdnjs
cdnjs.com libraries and font awesome. Go
ahead copy the very first
one and then put the link right here.
Now we should be able to use those
icons. So I'll put the I element. Let's
say class will be
fas
check- circle. And then I'll save. Here
we go. We got that circle. And after
this H1 we'll say P. Now this content
will be empty for now we'll say ID will
be date. Later in the video once we get
into the JavaScript part we will make
this text to be inside right within this
P tag but it'll be dynamic. All right.
After the header component we'll say
div. That will take the class name of
to-do. We'll go within this div. We'll
say create an input that is type of text
and we can add an ID like task dash
input and then
placeholder. Oops. So this should be
task input and then placeholder it'll be
what do you need to
do just like this and then right after
this input I'll put a button that will
be ID of let's say add dash task and
I'll put the i element the i tag let's
say class fas a
[Music]
plus okay so this is the end result that
we have at at the
moment right after this div which is the
to-do input we'll go ahead and add our
filters so these three filters I'll say
dot filters and we're going to create a
span let's say the class will be filter
and this will be active initially which
is going to be the all filter right and
I'd like to add a data dash filter
attribute I'll say this will be
Now we'll be using these later in the
video. For now, just go ahead duplicate
this twice. This will be filter but not
active. This will not be active as well.
This will be for the active
one. Let's say
active. And this will be for the
completed. Okay, let's save. Take a look
at the output. This is what we have at
the moment. Right after this div, after
the filters, we will add the to-dos
container. Okay. So, the first thing I'd
like to have is a UL that will have the
ID of to-dos list and content will be
empty. As we add more and more things,
we are going to add it right here within
this UL. Right? So you can add a comment
such as the list items will be
inserted
inserted right here later in the
video. Okay, after this ul I would like
to put a div. Now this will be the case
if we don't have anything. We're going
to get this icon and then no tasks here
yet.
So I'll say this div will have the class
name of
empty dash state and this will be hidden
by default. Let's go ahead say I. This
will be the icon
fasa-clipipboard list. Then we can say
something like no tasks yet but this
will be within a p tag. So I am too lazy
to type this out. I'll copy and
paste. Here we go.
So currently this is visible but we're
going to make it to be hidden unless we
have nothing right if we have something
we're going to see the input or the list
item but else this is this is going to
be the output and then after this to-dos
container so I'll just delete this
comment shrink this right after the
to-dos container I'll have a footer
element which is going to be this part
right I'll say get a p tag This will be
id of the items dash left. And we're
going to put something like zero items
left. And again, this will be dynamic
later in the video. So if you add more
and more things, this will be updated.
And if you check them, it'll be
decremented. So this will be uh updated
from our JavaScript code later in the
video. So I just need to mention them
couple of times so that it doesn't
really feel any complicated. I hope it's
not really annoying. So I'll say button
ID clear dash completed and let's say
clear
completed. So it is this button as you
can tell. So this is our output. Looks
terrible but we're going to fix it in a
couple of minutes. Okay. So we got the
styling linked into the HTML. We can go
ahead and get started with it. So let's
get into the style. CSS file. The first
thing I'd like to do is add my reset. So
I'll select everything and I'll say
margin of zero, petting of zero and then
box sizing will be equal to border
border box. Now let's create some CSS
variables just like what we have done
previously so that it's a lot more
convenient to work with the colors and
like CSS variables in general. So I'll
have my primary color. I'll just say
it'll be
F8. Okay, it'll be this primary purple
color that we have right here. And then
I'll have the primary light. Let me just
go ahead put them one by one. If you
wanted to type this out, you can just
pause the video and do so. This is what
I'll be doing just to not waste any
time. We'll have dark, light, gray.
We'll have danger, success, and finally
the border color. Okay, so I hope these
make sense. We'll be using them in a
couple of seconds. Now, let's say we're
going to select the body. I'll say font
family will be sensif. I'll say
background color is going to be it'll be
F1, F3, F5. Now, if you wanted to, you
can take this and put it as a CSS
variable, or you can still use the hash
values if this is something that we'll
be using only once. And I think this is
one of those cases where we'll be using
this value only once. So, I'll just put
it right here instead of creating a CSS
variable. So, it's completely optional.
Now, let's try to take a look at the
output. I'll save background has changed
output. And then I'll say the minimum
height will be equal to 100 VH. And then
we would like to center everything. So
I'll say display flex justify content
centered and align items to be centered.
Here we go. Then I'd like to add some
paddings. I'll say petting of 20 pixels.
And let's say color will be our dark
color. Right? So I'll say variable dash
dark. Here we go. Then I would like to
select the app class and I'll say width
will be 100%. But the maximum width is
going to be 500 pixels. Then we can say
background color is going to be let's
say white. Here we go. And I'll say
border
radius will be something like 12 pixels.
And we can say overflow will be hidden.
And finally, we can add some box shadow
so that it is looking kind of like box
shadowed, right? I don't I don't really
know what to say. Let's go ahead copy
paste this. Okay. So, if you wanted to,
you can increase the value, but I think
this is a bit too much and extreme. We
can go with something like 0.1. I think
it looks pretty clean. Now, the other
thing that I'd like to do just get the
header component. So I'll say select the
header element. I'll say background
color will be the primary color. So I'll
say variable dash
primary. Okay. Now I'd like to say color
will be white and padding could be
something like 20 pixels to 25 pixels.
Here we go. And this is a bit zoomed in
I believe. Let's see if this is the
case. No, it's not. It's in
100%. So it is the normal level that you
should have and then we can get the H1.
We'll say
header go ahead select the H1 element.
Font size could be incremented to be 24
pixels or I think this has been
decremented right now. If you delete
this it's a little bit larger. So I'll
say 24 pixels. Let's say margin bottom
of 5 pixels. And then I'll say font
weight of 600. And then I'll go ahead
get the P tag. So I'll say header P. Now
currently we cannot see it but it'll be
this date that we have. So this styles
will be visible later in the video. I'll
say the font size will be something like
14 pixels. And let's say opacity is
going to be
0.9. Okay. Now let's go ahead get the
to-do
input. So we'll say to-do input. Let's
say padding will be 20 pixels to 25
pixels. Here we go. I'll say display
will be flex. Gap will be 10 pixels. And
then we can say background color will be
white. And then we can say border
bottom is going to be one pixels. Solid
variable of
border. Here we go. Then we can go ahead
and get the input within this to-do
input. So we'll say flex will be one
which means it'll take the entire space
that is left. So we'll say padding will
be 12 pixels to 15 pixels. Here we go.
We'll select the border let's say it'll
be 1 pixels.
Solid D E like Double E 2 E and six.
Then we can get the font size. Let's say
it'll be 1 RM. Then we can finally get
the transition to be all 0.2 seconds.
Now I'll go ahead and get the focus
state within this
[Music]
input. So here we would like to say no
outline. So outline will be none. Let's
say border color will be updated to to
the primary color.
And then we can add some box shadow when
we when we focus into this
input. Okay, just like this. This is
what we have. Now I think we also want
to add some border radiuses. So I'll say
border radius could be 6 pixels. Here we
go. And then after the focus state, we
can get the to-do
input button this time. So we're going
to update this button on the right hand
side. So I will say background color
will be equal to the primary color that
we have. And then we'll update the color
to be white. Here we go. We can give
some paddings or maybe instead of
pettings I'll go ahead and give the
width to be 40 pixels and same for the
height. Okay. So this is what we have.
Now let's say we don't want to have any
borders. And then we'll say border
radius again. It'll be 6 pixels. so that
it is consistent and we can say cursor
will be
pointer and finally I'll say transition
will be all 0.2 seconds. Let's update
the hover state. I'll say to-do input.
We're going to get the oops let's say
get the button hover state background
color will be primary light this
time. Okay. And then right after this
selection we can get the
filters. So I'll say display of flex. We
can give a bit gap of 15 pixels. Let's
say border bottom will be equal to 1
pixel. Solid and the border color that
we had. Finally I'll say
padding will be 15 pixels to 25
pixels. Okay. So this is what we got.
And now on every single filter we would
like to do something. So I'll say filter
go ahead get them. We'll say petting
will be five pixels to three pixels. And
then we would like to say cursor will be
pointer so that it feels like as a
button. I'll say color will be gray but
it should be wrapped with it wrapped
with variable. I'll say gray. Here we
go. And then I'll say border bottom I'll
say two pixels solid and transparent.
Now we would like to go ahead get the
transition. I'll say all
0 2 seconds. Then we can go ahead get
the filter hover state. We will update
the color just like in the end result.
So when we hover over them, it'll be
updated. So I'll say hover um I think we
can say color is going to
be the primary
color. Okay.
And then after this one I'll say if
filter is active we'll like to say color
is going to be primary one then we can
say border bottom is going to be two
pixels solid and we'll say variable of
d- primary so this one is active as you
can tell so it will uh it'll apply these
styles then we can also say font weight
is going to be 500
Maybe we should go with
600. I don't really
know. Okay, I'll go with 500. Then we
can go ahead get the to-do container,
right? I'll say to-dos
container where I'd like to add some
pettings. So I'll say instead of auto,
it'll be 15 pixels to zero. Then I'd
like to get some maximum height of 300
pixels. Then I'll give I think
overflow dashy it'll be auto. Now why
this is the case? Let's see if I add
bunch of different things. This is what
I'll be doing. Okay. At some point this
content will overflow because the
maximum height is 300 pixels. Let's say
this is 300 pixels. The rest content
will overflow. So we say in the overflow
case go ahead add a scroll bar. Right?
This is how we can do it. Just give a
maximum height but also add the overflow
of auto and specifically in the y
direction, right? Because it is in the
vertical direction in this case. I hope
that makes sense. Now, we cannot see
anything because we don't really have
any items yet. But later in the video,
it should be it should it should make
sense, right? So, after the to-dos
container, I'll go ahead get the to-dos
list. This is going to be a selector
with the ID. I'll say a list style type
is going to be none because this is an
unordered lists. I mean it's an
unordered list and we don't really want
to see those kind of like bullet points,
right? I'll say to-do item. I'll get
some
paddings such as 12 pixels to 15 pixels.
Again, we cannot see the styling yet.
This will be a bit later in the video
once we have those. So this is basically
what we are building at the moment. So
I'll move on and I'll say display will
be flex align items will be centered and
let's give the transition on the
background
color and then I'll say it'll be 0.2
seconds. Now we can say if todo item is
hovered what'll happen? Let's see. So
the background changes right? We'll say
background color is going to be the
light color that we have. Okay. Now we
can say the checkbox
container dash container. Now you might
be asking we don't really have this
class in index.html right? If you take a
look at it we don't really have it but
it will be added once we add some list
items. Okay for now let's add the
styling. I'll say the checkbox container
will have the margin right of 15 pixels
as you can tell. And then we'll say the
to-do checkbox will have the opacity of
zero and position will be absolute.
Let's save. Again, we cannot see
anything. We don't really have any
items, but we'll get there. Then we can
go ahead get the check mark itself. So,
at this point, I'd like to copy and
paste and walk you through it line by
line. So we'll say display of inline
block with and height of 20 pixels some
borders border radiuses position will be
relative cursor pointer and some
transitions and just before we move on
I'd like to update the index.html file
with some hardcoded data so that we can
see something on the UI as we go. Right?
So I'll go ahead add a list item that
has the class name of to-do item and
just make sure that this is under the ul
element. So, we have a label with the
input as well as the span. Then, we have
another span that says buy groceries and
then a button with this icon. Now, let's
save. This is the output. Now, we're
going to add some classes to make that
look nice. So, without this, let's see
what would happen. You cannot really see
the check mark, right? So, this class is
updating check mark. Let's see which one
is this. Okay, it is the span that we
have. Now let's move on. I'll say right
after right after this I'll say to-do
checkbox if this is checked we would
like to say plus dot check mark. Now
what does that
mean? So we just said if todo checkbox
is checked if to-do checkbox is checked
right if this input is checked go ahead
select the very next
span that has the check mark class. So I
hope that makes sense. Now we are going
to select this one and we will update
the background color that will be let's
say variable of success and then we'll
say border
color will also be success and let's see
this in output right here. Okay, so the
background is success as well as the
border color. Let's see if we can see
this in action. Here we go. Now, if you
don't add the border color, let's see
what would happen. So, only the content
itself is green. I hope that makes
sense. So, this is the check mark that
we just updated. But now, I'd like to
I'd like to draw this check kind of div,
right? So, here I'll go ahead say to-do
checkbox. If it is checked, we would
like to select the check mark and we are
going to add the after element. So I'll
say content will be nothing. It'll be
position of
absolute. Let's say position will be
absolute. Then we'll say left will be 6
pixels. Top will be 2 pixels. Width will
be 5 pixels. Height could be 10 pixels.
Now let's save. This is what we have at
the moment. Basically nothing. But let's
go ahead and move on. I think on the
check mark I was going to say did we
forgot the position of relative? No, we
don't. So that's that's great. We'll go
ahead say border will be solid and
white. Okay, now this is what we have.
We can update it and make it look like a
check mark. So I'll say border width is
going to be zero 2 pixels 2 pixels and
zero. Here we go. This is what we got.
Now we are going to just rotate it. I'll
say transform will be rotated with
45°. And now this is a check mark. So
this is kind of like an advanced CSS or
I wouldn't really say advanced CSS, but
this is something that you should be a
little bit clever, right? We just drew a
rectangular and then we deleted some
borders such as these left and top top
border and then we rotated it and this
is the
output. Okay, now we'll go ahead add the
to-do item text which is going to be
this
one. So to-do item dash
text let's say flex will be one. So
it'll take the entire space or as much
as possible. We'll say font size could
be
onem and then transition is going to be
all 0.2
seconds. Then we can go and say to-do
item.
If it is completed, we'll select the
to-do item
[Music]
text and then we'll say text decoration
will be line
through and then the color is going to
be variable of
[Music]
gray. Okay, so for some reason this did
not work because we don't really have
the completed class. If I go ahead and
add this completed class on the to-do
item. Let's see where is the to-do item.
I'll say
completed. It should be like
uh it should be changed. Here we go. And
then we'll just move on with the delete
button. So instead of typing this out, I
think I am a bit lazy. Paste this in.
Let's save. Now we cannot really see it.
It says opacity zero but let's say one
for now. Okay, this is how that look.
For now it'll be opacity of zero but
later in the video we will update it.
Right? So we'll say if todo item is
hovered the delete button opacity will
be one just like this. And then we can
even change the color itself. I'll say
if delete button itself hovered the
cover will be danger. So here it will it
would not but here it should. Okay. So
that's why we don't really put the color
right here. And finally we are going to
update the empty
state. So if we delete everything
uh or let's just take a look at the
completed filter. This is the output
that we have. This is the empty state
and let's try to update it.
Right. Okay. First I'll go ahead delete
this. Maybe comment this
out. I'll say dot empty
state. Let's say display will be flex.
Flex direction will be
column. I'll say align items would be
centered. Justify content would be
centered as well. Here we go. I'll say
padding is going to be 40
pixels to zero.
And then color is going to be equal to
gray. Now I'll select the empty state of
icon right the icon of the empty state.
I'll say font size is going to be
incremented to be 40 pixels and margin
bottom of 10 pixels. Finally opacity is
going to be
0.7. Here we go. And let's say the
hidden
class is going to have this style which
is display of
none. Finally, we'll add the footer
element. So what I'd like to do just
copy and paste because this is super
simple that we have done millions of
times at the moment right so far. So
display flex so that they are side by
side. Justify content space between
align items of centered some padding.
Change the border top background color
and font size. Okay. Now let's get the
items on the left. Let's say items left.
The color will be updated. Then the
clear completed button. We'll say cursor
cursor will be pointer color will be
updated and the rest. So this is how
that look. And on the hover state we
will update the color to be this red
color. Right. Okay, so with that, that's
going to be for the entire CSS file. In
the next section, or maybe just in a
second, we're going to get into the
script.js file. Okay, so now let's get
started with the JavaScript file. Now,
we would like to get all of our DOM
elements so we can type them out or the
better option, I have prepared a GitHub
gist that you can find the link in the
description. Go ahead and find the to-do
app.md file and select everything that
you have seen here. Copy it and paste it
right here. So we got couple of
different items, couple of different
elements that we'll be using. All right.
So the first thing I'd like to do is
create some variables. I'll say let
to-dos. This will be an empty array
initially. And then we'll say let
current filter is going to be equal to
all. So this is the default value that
we'll start with. And then I'd like to
add some event listeners. So I'll say
add a task button add event listener
which will be the click event. Once we
clicked it, we're going to run this
arrow function where we would like to
call the add to-do
method with the task input value. So
whatever you put here it would be sent
to this method. And I also want to add
another method or sorry I would like to
add another event listener that will be
for the enter right. So we can either
add something by pressing to this button
or we can press enter. So they are right
here. I'll say task input dot add
eventlister.
This will be key down where we would
like to get the
event. I'll say if event key is equal to
enter, we would like to go ahead and run
this add to-do method with the task
input value. Now, since this is only a
one line, I can go ahead delete it and
just put it side by side. This is what
I'd like to do most of the time. If I
just have an if check with with a single
line, I just put it next to it rather
than creating curly braces. Okay. Now,
I'd like to create one more event
listener. I'll say clear completed
button. We'll listen for the click
event. So, when we click to this, we
would like to call this method called
clear completed. For now, I'll just have
it as an empty function.
Later in the video, we're going to build
it. So, the first function that we would
like to get started with is the add
to-do, right? Add to-do function, which
will take the
text and we would like to just check if
this is empty. So, if you do not add
anything and press this, nothing should
happen, right? I'll say if
text.trim if this is equal to an empty
string. Now, we are using trim. That's
because if user wants to add an empty
string, still nothing should happen.
We'll say if this is the case, it just
return don't do anything. But else we
can go ahead create a
to-do. Let's say
to-do which will be an object. And here
we'll be having an ID. I'd like to make
this to be unique. So I'll just say
date
now. And then we'll add the text. This
will be equal to the text that we have.
Now since they are the same, we can
shorten this. And here we should have a
comma. Then I'll say by default the
completed will be false. Now that we got
the to-do object, we would like to say
to-dos.push. So we're going to push this
to-do into this array that we have
above. Right? So we just updated the
array. Now we would like to update the
local storage as well. So I'll say save
to-dos call this method and then we'll
say render to-dos as well. For now I'll
comment this out. This will update the
UI but this will update the local
storage. So I'll say
function save
todos. I'll say local storage do set
item. We'll update the to-dos key. You
can call this anything really such as
hello, but it should be
something something that makes sense. In
this case, it'll be todos. We'll say
JSON.
Stringify these to-dos that we are
adding. And then I'd like to update the
item items count. This is another
function that we'll create. And then
we'll say check empty state state.
So this will check if user should see
this kind of a UI or if they should see
this kind of AI I was going to say but
let's say this kind of AI right so if
they don't have anything this is what
they see but if they have something this
is what the user will see now let's try
to create these functions I'll say
function let's create this one
first and duplicate
it now we're going to add this function
function. So first let's get started
with this one. I'll say con uncompleted
to-dos. We'll say todos do
filter where we'll get the to-do and
I'll say if it is not completed, right?
I'll say
to-do is not
completed. So this should be todos by
the way. We got the list the array and
I'll say items left text content will be
updated. Now this will be dynamic. So,
I'll put back text and I'll say
uncompleted
to-dos.length. So, whatever the length
is and then items left. But now notice
how so I'll try to just delete some
stuff. So, I'll just leave only one. If
it is only one, you will see item. But
if it is multiple, it would be items.
So, we are going to even check for this.
So I'll say length and we'll say item
and here it should be dynamic. So we
will say maybe I'll give out this
space uncompleted
to-dos.length if it is not equal to one
that means it'll be plural but else we
can leave it as an empty string and
finally we will say
left. Okay.
Now let's see it says zero items left
which is what you'd like to have for the
zero it should be items but this is
currently not coming from this method it
is coming from the HTML file. Oops.
Let's go ahead check the
HTML. So if you say five this is what
you would see but just in a couple of
minutes we are going to update it
dynamically. So this is just the
function we have defined it. We are not
using it yet. And then we can I think go
ahead and build the render to-dos
function which is going to be the
longest one. But this is the actual
function that will make our application
work
right and I think we can build this one
as well which will be pretty simple. So
I'll say const filtered to-dos. Now we
would like to we would like to filter
the to-dos. I'll say filter to-dos. We
would like to pass the current filter,
right? So it either it is all active or
completed. Let's create this
function. So I know that this might look
a little bit complicated at the moment,
but this is really how we can how we can
move forward. We'll just build one
function at a time and at the end it
should work and it should all make
sense. Once we complete it, I can walk
you through it pretty quickly. So we're
going to get the filter, right? This is
the current filter that we just passed.
And we'll have a switch statement. I'll
say switch. We'll say add the filter.
We'll say if case is equal to active,
we'd like to say return the active
to-dos. So I'll say to-dos
filter where the to-do is not completed.
So I'll say to-do completed is equal to
false. And then we're going to go ahead
and say if case is equal to
completed in this case I'll duplicate
this I'll say where the to-do is
completed but in the else
case so here I'll say in the default
case we'll just return all the to-dos
without filtering anything. Okay so we
got those to-dos I'll say if filter
todos.length length is equal to zero. We
can say empty state doclass list dot
remove
hidden and if you just read this line it
should make sense right if we don't have
any to-dos we are going to see this on
the UI we're going to remove the hidden
class so that it is visible but in the
else case so here I'll say else empty
state doclass list we're going to add
the hidden
class and I just realized this should be
filtered to-dos right not filter this is
a method this is the variable that we
have okay now I think we can go ahead
and get started with the render to-dos
so I'll say
function render to-dos this is not going
to take any arguments so we can just get
started with it so first what I'd like
to do just get rid of the entire UI I'll
say to-dos list inner html will be equal
to nothing because we're going to update
it, right? This is kind of like a reset.
I'll say const filtered to-dos. We're
going to say filter to-dos call it with
the current
filter. Okay. Then we would like to say
filter to-dos for each. We'll get every
single to-do and I'll I will run this
function. So the first thing we would
like to do is create a list item. And
that list item is going to be looking
like this that we have. So we're going
to create the list item that's going to
have this class name. It'll have a label
with the input span, another span, and a
button. Right? So this will be a little
bit long, but we're going to go step by
step. Let's say const todo
item. I'll say document.createelement.
create
element create a list element and then
I'll say to-do item doclass list dot add
it'll be equal to to-do dash item then
we'll say if to-do is
completed in this case we would like to
say to-do item class list at the
completed
class okay we would like to go below to
it right I'll Say let's create a custom
checkbox. I'll say con checkbox
container. Let's create it. I'll say
document dot create element. This will
be equal to a label element. And then
we'll say add a
uh let's say class
list. Add a class that called the
checkbox dash container. So we just
created the container. Now it's time to
create the checkbox itself. I'll say
this will be equal to
document.createelement which is going to
be an input and the type of this input
type of this
checkbox is going to be equal to
checkbox. Let's say checkbox. Here we
go. And then I'll add a class
list that is going to be equal to to-do
checkbox. And I'll say
checkbox dot checked. So either it'll be
true or false which is going to be
coming from to-do.comp completed field
and then we can say checkbox dot add
event
listener. We're going to listen for the
change event. In this case, we are going
to call this function called toggle
to-do with the to-do ID. We're going to
pass the ID so that we know which to-do
that we're updating. Right? So, we're
going to toggle the state whenever we
click to it. And let's create this
function as well. I'll duplicate this.
Let's say toggle to-do. This will take
an
ID. We're going to build it in a bit
later in the video. And now let's create
the check mark itself. So we created the
checkbox. Now let's create the check
mark which is this one. Right? I'll say
con check
mark that will be equal to document dot
createelement of span. We'll go ahead
say let's add a class list. So we are
going to add a new class name that will
be equal to
check mark. And then now we are going to
update the UI. Right? I'll say checkbox
container.append child checkbox. And
then I'll duplicate this. We're going to
also append the check mark. Okay. Now we
would like to create a text element.
I'll say const todo
[Music]
text. We are going to create a span
element. I'll say to-do text dot class
list dot
add
to-do item
text and then we would like to update
the text
content. I'll say text content will be
equal to todo.ext. So whatever the value
is and then we can create a delete
button. Now at this point I think we can
move a little bit faster. I'll add a
class name called delete button and the
content will be this which is this exact
um icon. If you take a look at the index
html this is what we have used
previously as
well. Okay. So this is the exact same
thing and then when we click to it we
would like to call a function right that
is called delete to-do. I'll duplicate
this call the delete to-do. Um we will
implement it in al later in the video.
Okay. So we created everything. Now
let's add this elements to the to-do
item. We'll say to-do item dot append
child checkbox container. Duplicate it.
That will be the to-do text. Duplicate
it. And then delete button.
And then finally we'll say to-dos list
append
[Music]
child to-do
item. So what we are doing here is this
basically so we created all these
elements one by one right at the end of
the day we would like to take all of
them right all of them and put it under
the list item and then take the list
item put it under the ul so that it is
visible on the UI okay so this is what
we are doing now let's try to save this
which we already did and give it a go
I'll say
learn HTML and CSS. Let's
add. Okay, something has been updated.
Not the UI. We'll take a look at it why,
but definitely something is working.
I'll go ahead and just say learn
Python. Add this. Now, two items left.
So, it so looks like something is
working right now. Let's try to scroll
to the top and see if we have called the
render to-dos method. Looks like we
didn't. So, let's save. Okay. I'll try
to add something else. I'll say learn
JavaScript this
time and add
this. Okay. So, once again it did not
work. Let's open up the
terminal. Okay. It says cannot read the
length on the check empty state. I'll
just say
length uncompleted to-dos. This is the
only thing that we
have. Okay. So, why this is the case?
Maybe it's because we don't really have
any uncompleted to-dos. So, to-do is not
completed. Now, to be able to get rid of
this, you can add question
marks, right? The optional
chaining. I'll try to add something
else. Once again, let's just say
something random. Let's just say frfr
three times. Okay, once again we got an
error, but let's try to fix it. I don't
really want to cut this out from the
tutorial. So again, it is coming from
the check empty state. Add save to-dos
and add
to-dos. Now the length
is is causing this, right? I'll just
search for length.
We have another one right
here. So, whatever the current filter
is, it is
all. I'll add question mark right here
as
well. Okay. Once again, let's give it a
go. I'll say learn something
else. And then it says we cannot read
the for each method. Now, let's see why
this is the case. Why did we encounter
this much of
errors? I'll just search for for
each. So this function is not really
working as
expected. Okay, I think here we should
say return to-dos instead of just
to-dos, right? Okay, that was the issue.
Now if you don't say return, it doesn't
return anything. And this is equal to
undefined. So that was something that we
have and I didn't deleted this part from
the video so that you can see my entire
thought
process. Um, okay. Let's save and try to
add one last
thing. Here we go. UI has been updated.
We can see it right here. But what
happened to the previous items? Now they
are definitely in the local storage. I
can open up my application local
storage. So here it should be
application not cookies but local
storage. All right. So we have bunch of
different values. Here we have some
to-dos. Okay. So maybe the previous ones
have been
deleted. Why this is the case? If I
refresh this page. So it is right here.
Let's add something else.
Okay. So what happens is this. Whenever
you add something new, it is going it is
going to update this one instead of
adding on top of
it. Okay. Kind of strange. When you
refresh add something
new, it's going to replace it. But if
you don't refresh the page and add
something, it's going to add on top of
it. So we're going to get into this
functionality. But first, we would like
to get everything from the local storage
and display it on the UI whenever we
load our page. So, let's add an event
listener for that. So, I will go right
here at the bottom of the file and I'll
say window addventlister. Let's listen
for DOM content loaded. And then we
would like to run this function where
we'll just say call the render to-dos or
let's say load
to-dos. Let's create this function as
well. Let's say
function load
to-dos. So this will get the stored
to-dos from the local
storage. I'll say local storage.get
item. where we have this to-dos and then
I'll say if we have some value we would
like to say to-dos array will be equal
to that value I'll say JSON parse the
stored to-dos and then just go ahead
render it on the
UI okay now let's refresh looks like we
don't really have anything okay so of
course it is not going to work if you
don't call this function let's go ahead
call this and save. Here we go. These
are the values that we are getting from
the local storage. Right? Let's try to
delete them manually. Here I'll go ahead
get the application. Let's get the
to-dos and I'll just delete them. I'll
press delete. They are gone. Now if we
refresh, they are not going to be there,
right? And let's add something like
learn Python. Add this. Refresh. It
should still be here. That means this is
working as expected. Now let's scroll to
the top. I'd like to add more things
when we say add to-do. So we are going
to render the to-dos but also we would
like to reset the form. Right? Currently
if I say learn javascript it has been
added but this is not not getting
updated. So I'll say task input do value
will be equal to an empty string. Let's
add
something. It'll just reset itself
without redoing anything. And now we can
add the function where we would like to
delete the to-do
itself. So here we'll get the to-do ID.
I'll go ahead say this to-dos will be
equal to todos do filter. So we're going
to filter out the one that has just been
deleted. We'll say get every single
to-do and check if to-do ID is not equal
to this ID and include it. But else go
ahead and delete that. Then we'll just
save the to-dos to the local storage.
And I will say render the to-dos. Okay,
let's go ahead and give it a go. I'll
try to delete this one. Now it is not
here and the local storage has been
updated. Let's refresh. As you can tell,
it is not here. Now the other method
could be to toggle the state, which is
this one, right? Let's give all this
space. I'll say we're going to say the
to-dos will be equal to todos do map.
We're going to get every single to-do
and then run this
function here. I'll say
if to-do ID is equal to this ID. We're
going to go ahead and update the
completed field. So I'll say return all
the previous fields of the to-do
and update the completed state right
we'll say it will be equal to to-do
completed but we are going to negate it
so if it is equal to true it'll be false
if it is equal to false it'll be true
right and if this is not the case we'll
just return the to-do as
itself okay and then we'll say save this
to the local storage and and then update
the
UI. Okay, now let's give it a go. I'll
say complete it. Refresh. It is still
this value. I can complete this one.
Uncompleted. Refresh. And this is what
we got. Now the other functionality that
I'd like to add is this button. Let's
just search for it. Here we have the
clear button. Clear completed button. We
have added this function which is this
one. So when we click it, it's going to
delete the completed ones, right? So
let's say this one is completed. If I
click it, this should be deleted. I'll
go ahead and say maybe to-dos. It'll be
equal to to-dos
dot filter. Right? We're going to get
every single to-do. So with this, we
only have the uncompleted to-dos, right?
We'll say save to-dos. Go ahead, call
this and render to-dos.
Okay, I'll click it. Now UI has been
updated. And then we have one more
thing. Let's try to refresh. Now when we
refresh, it says zero items left. But we
actually one item left. So we would like
to fix this as well. And to be able to
update it once after we get the to-dos
from the local storage, we'll just say
update the UI with the update items
count. Right, let's refresh. Here we go.
We have one item left. When we refresh
it, this is what we got. Let's add more
things. Okay, now I'll just say this one
and this one is completed. If we take a
look at the
active looks like UI is not being
updated. Okay, we're going to take a
look at it. These does not work. And to
be able to make them work, we can add an
event listener, which will be click,
right? We're going to add a click uh
event listener to this one, this, and
then the completed one. So let's go
ahead and try to do so. I'll say get the
filters for every single one of them. We
would like to run this function where
we'll say filter dot add event listener
of click and then we are going to run
this
function. So I'll say set active
[Music]
filter. And how do we get the filter on
all of them? Right? How do we know if
this is the all, if this is active and
this is completed? So, we have added
some attributes like data-filter. Right?
And they have all these values. This
should be a lower case by the way. I
don't know why I put it as uppercased,
but it should be a
lowercase like this one. Here we go. So,
just update that. Now, we'll say um set
active filter. We'll say get the filter
get the attribute which is called as
data dash filter. So this will give you
the value and then we can build this
method which will be easier than you
think. We'll say
function where we'll get the filter as
the argument and then we can say first
let's grab the current filter which is
this one and then we'll say filters. So
filters do for each every single filter
we will run this method. And I'd like to
maybe just call this as item so that
it's not really confusing. I'll say if
item get
attribute get the attribute of
data-filter. If this is equal to the
filter that we have in this case, we'll
just say item doclass list dot add the
active class. In the else case, we'll
just say remove
[Music]
it. Okay, so this will just make sure
that only one of them one of them is
active at a time. And then once we have
done this, we would like to update the
to-dos.
And now it should be working out. I'll
say
active. So we only see the active ones.
If I say completed, here we go. And then
all of them. And one more thing that we
are missing is to set our date, right?
We would like to get the today's date
and format it in this format. So I will
create a function for this. I'll say
function that is called as set
date. And we would like to call this
function whenever we load this page.
We'll just say set date. Now let's get
into it. So we'll say con today which
will be equal to the new date. And now
we would like to create some options so
that we can update it properly so that
we can format it properly. Right? I'll
say options where the weekday will be in
the long format.
Month will be short let's
say and then day will be
numeric. So we'll go ahead and just say
date element dot text content it'll be
equal to today do local dates date
string we can use n us and then put the
options. Okay, so here we can see
today's date is right here as expected.
If you wanted to, you can change the
options which is going to update the
formatting. But this is the one that I'd
like to that I'd like to have in my
code. So let's go ahead and save this
file. And I think that's kind of it for
this entire project, right? Let's just
try to test this out for the very last
time. I'll try to add something else.
Let's just say something else. We can
add it with either enter key or we can
press to this button. It'll be added. We
can toggle the state delete. Refresh.
Everything should be here. Can say clear
the completed ones. We can change the
filter.
Right. And we can delete it
manually. So that's going to be it for
this project and hopefully I'll see you
in the next one. All right. So, welcome
back to this section. We're going to
build an entire contact form. This
project only includes HTML and CSS.
There is no JavaScript at all. So, this
is one of those projects where you can
practice your design skills with CSS.
Okay. So, we have some cool animations
with box shadows and
nicely designed inputs. And finally, we
have some info section. And this entire
form will be animated from the bottom of
the screen when you refresh the page.
Right? So we have this slide in effect.
If you would like to get the end result
screenshot, it'll be right here in the
diagrams and the link will be in the
description. With this in mind, let's go
ahead and get started with it. So for
these icons, I'll be using Font Awesome.
So I'll just visit
cdjs.com and then search for Font
Awesome. Okay. So I'll click it and I'll
get the very first link that we have.
Okay. Now we have three empty files.
First let's get started with
HTML. I'll get the boiler plate. Let's
say contact
form link our CSS file and then paste
the font awesome link. Now we can get
started with the body element. So first
I'd like to put those side by side. And
this is completely responsive by the
way. As you can tell, once we hit a
certain break point, it's going to be in
the column direction, right? Okay. So,
I'll say open with a live server. It
should be right
here. But we don't really have any
content. Okay. So, I'll go ahead and get
started with it. So, first I'll have a
div with the class name of
container. And then I'll have one more
container, but this time it'll be called
as form container. And then we'll have
an H1 that will be this text that says
get in touch. And then we can have a P
tag. It's going to be this one. Let's
say fill out the form below to contact
us. And right after this P, we'll go
ahead create a form element. It's not
going to have any actions, so let's
delete it. We'll have a div that will be
input
group. Input dash group. Then we'll go
ahead create one more div that will be
for the input field. So say class input
dash
field. And then we'll have an i element
where we will hold the icon. So it's
going to be this icon. Let's say
fasa- user. And then right below to
we'll have an input which is going to be
type of text. We can give it a
placeholder like name. And then we'll
say this is going to be required. Okay.
Let's
save. This is the end result that we
have. And then we can duplicate this.
I'll basically duplicate this and give
one space. This will be FA uh like FAS
and FA envelope.
Okay, for the type, this is going to be
email and placeholder will be equal to
email. Okay, and now let's try to
duplicate this once again. Here we go.
The icon will be
phone, type will be tell, and then let's
say phone. We could say something like
optional. Since this is optional, we can
delete the required field. Right? Okay.
So, this is exactly what we're building
at the moment. We can duplicate this
once again. And this time it'll be icon
of FA tag. Let's say type of text. And
then this will be the
subject and
required. Okay, let's save. So this is
the output. Now this time instead of an
input field, we will create a message
field because this is a bit different,
right? I'll say dot message dash
field. We'll go ahead get an icon. This
time it'll be FA message and we can
delete this empty space. And then I'll
have a text area component or the
element. So I'll delete the ID and then
the name. Let's say placeholder will be
your
message and then I'll say it'll be
required. Okay. Right after this div
I'll have a button. Let's say type will
be submit.
We'll go ahead have a div with the class
name of btn dashc
content. We can have a span that will be
sent
message and then finally the
icon which is going to be class of
fasa- paper
plane. Okay. So that's going to be it
for the entire form. At the very bottom
we would like to have this info. So
after the form we'll say div that will
have the class of contact dash info. We
can say get the info item and we are
going to be having this three times. So
we can say multiply this by three. Right
here within the very first one we'll get
an icon that will be class of fas a map
marker alt. Okay. So it is this icon
that we just got. Then after this I I'll
say span and just get this content. You
can put anything that you
wish. Okay. Right after
this I'll get a different icon that is
called FAS FA
[Music]
envelope and then for the content we can
get the exact same thing that we have
here. I'll put a span and put it inside.
Now finally here we'll have another icon
that will be for
phone and then for the span I'll get
this
text. Okay. So this is the entire UI
that we have built only the markup. Now
we'll go ahead and get started with the
CSS file that we have already linked and
we are not going to have any JavaScript
so we can delete
it. Okay. So let's get into the CSS file
and get started with it. So the first
thing that we always do is to add some
basic resets, right? I'll say get the
padding of zero from all directions.
Margin of zero and then box sizing will
be border box. And we can add a
different font family. This is optional.
You can put anything that you wish. I'll
go with
sif. Okay. And then I'd like to add some
CSS variables. So I'll just get my root
element and I'll say dash the primary
color will be equal to this one which is
going to be 4 a de e 80. I'll duplicate
this. I'll have primary dark. And let's
not forget to turn this off or add the
semicolon at the end. Now this will be
C5 ne. I'll duplicate this. This is
going to be BG dark and the value is
going to be 1 A three times. Let's
duplicate this. This will be text light
F uh 3 F4
F6. Let's say
text light and I'll have text gray.
Let's say we will have card
BG. Then we we can have input BG as
well.
And finally the border
radius border
radius. Okay, let's just put these
values. This is going to be 10 pixels.
We'll have the input BG as 333 and then
we'll have cart BG as 25 three
times just like this. And then the text
gray will be 9 C A3 AF. And then this
value I think this is something that we
have already put correctly. Okay. So
we'll be using these variables just in a
second. We'll go ahead and get the body
element. Now we'll say the background
color is going to be equal to bar dashbg
dark. Okay. Then we'll go ahead and
change the color that will be text
light. Okay. Then we'll say minimum
height is going to be 100 ph. So we'll
say display
flex justify content centered and align
items will be centered. Then we can say
padding will be 30 pixels to 15 pixels.
Then we'll go ahead to get the container
itself. I'll say the width is going to
be 100% and the maximum width will be
pixels. Here we go. Then we'll go ahead
select the form container and we'll
update the background color. So I'll say
background color will
be card bg. Okay. And then we'll get the
border radius value. I'll say variable
dash border radius which is going to be
equal to 10
pixels. And then we can get a hidden
value such as 40 pixels from all
directions. And then we can add a box
shadow. So I'll say box shadow will be
equal to zero 10 pixels 30 pixels and
then
RGBA let's say it'll be
0.3 okay then we'll go ahead add an
animation now this animation will be let
me demonstrate pretty quickly it'll be
this slide in effect from the bottom of
the screen right so we will add this
animation called fade
in let's say 0.5 seconds and it can be
ease out. Now we don't have this fade in
animation right we can create it with a
key frame so I'll say key frames and the
name should be fade
in we'll say go from this styles to this
one and here from will be opacity of
zero and then we'll say
transform translate
y of let's say 20 pixels because we'll
be coming from the bottom right and now
two which is the end result will be
opacity of one and transform of let's
say just reset it just going to be 0
pixels in the Y direction right now
let's save and take a look at
it okay whenever I refresh it'll be like
fade in from the bottom of the screen
now we can add more things but I think
this is already looking pretty nice so
I'll just leave it as it is then I would
like to select the H1
one. Let's give a little bit
space. I'll say the color is going to be
primary color that we have. Here we go.
And then I'll say font size will be
2.2mm. Then we'll go ahead say margin
bottom will be 10 pixels. And then we
can select the p tag. I'll say margin
bottom will be 30 pixels. And then color
is going to be text
gray. Okay. Then we can get the input
group
class if I can't type correctly. Here we
go. We'll say display will be grid. Now
hear me out. Let me demonstrate this
pretty quickly. So it'll be display of
grid, right? But once we hit a certain
break point, it's going to be in the
column direction. So let's see how we
can make that work. I'll say display
will be grid and then we'll have the
grid template columns that will be
repeat of let's say auto-ash fit and
then minm max 240 pixels to one fraction
let's see the end
result okay so this is how that work at
the moment now let's move on right after
this I'd like to add some gap such as 20
pixels and then we can say margin bottom
will be 25 pixels. I will get the input
field. This will be position of relative
because we'll you'll use position
absolute on the like on these icons. And
we'll select the message field as
well. And it'll be also position of
relative so that we can nicely position
this icon. Let's do it immediately. I'll
say input field and we'll say message
field. Now we would like to select the
icon within the message field as well as
the icon within the input field. Right?
So I'll select both of them and I'll say
position will be absolute. It'll be top
of 50%. From the left we can say 15
pixels. transform on the translate Y is
going to be minus 50% so that it is
centered vertically. Now let's save and
let's see what we're going to get. Okay,
so it is overflowed within this and
we'll say color is going to be primary
color and then finally font size of 1.1
RM. So this is what we have now.
Currently, it looks not really good, but
once we format the input as well as the
text area, it'll look nice. Okay. So,
here I'll go ahead and get the message
field icon. And I'll change the top
position to be 25 pixels. Okay. Now,
we'll go ahead and get the input as well
as the text area. So, I'll say input as
well as the text
area. This will have the width of 100%.
Here we go. We'll say padding is going
to be 15 pixels from all directions, but
at the very end will be 45 pixels, which
is going to be from the left hand side.
And then we'll say background color is
going to be input
bg. Okay. Then we'll say border is going
to be 2 pixels, solid, and transparent.
Then we would like to add the border
radius. And then the color is going to
be text light. Here we go. And then I'll
say font size will be 1
RM. And finally the transition from
everything. Let's say 0.3 seconds in
ease. Okay. Now let's add the text area
itself. We are going to update it a bit.
I'll say the height is going to be 150
pixels. Let's save. And then I'll say
the resize is going to be equal to none
because currently I can't resize it,
right? And since we have some
transitions, it is happening really
slowly. But we're going to get rid of
this resize property. And I just
realized this should be text area. I had
a typo. Let's save. Now we don't really
have this resize option. I'll say margin
bottom will be 35 or 25 pixels. Okay.
Now we'll go ahead and get the focus
state on both input as well as the text
[Music]
area. And we'll say the border color
will be
updated. Let's say border color not the
background. It's going to be primary
color that we have. And then outline is
going to be
none. And finally, I'd like to add some
box shadow. So if we don't have if we
don't add the box shadow, this is how
it'll look like. It's still looking
pretty nice, but I'd like to have this
effect as well. So I don't really know
if it is visible from the video, but
there is definitely a subtle change
which is happening thanks to box shadow.
So let's go ahead and add it. I'll say
box shadow. And I'd like to just provide
the value box shadow everything zero but
then three pixels and then we have this
green color. Now let's see the end
result. Okay. So this is what we have at
the very outside
layer. Then we can get the
placeholder styling. I'll say
input placeholder element and duplicate
it. This will be for the text area.
I'd like to change the color to be text
gray. All right. So, it's been updated.
A subtle change, but I think it's
looking pretty nice. Then we'll go ahead
and get the button itself and say the
background color will be updated to
primary color that we
have. Then we can get the color itself.
It's going to be black. And then I'll
say font weight of
500 or let's go even with 600. And then
I'll say font size will be 1 RM. Here we
go. We can give some border of none.
We'll just get rid of that. And then
border radius of border radius variable
that we have. Paddings will be 16 pixels
to 30 pixels. Then we can say cursor is
going to be
pointer and then I'll say width will be
100% no matter what happens and then the
transition will be for everything 0.3
seconds and we can say
ease. Okay. Now on the hover state let's
try to update
something which is going to be the
background color itself. it'll be
primary dark and then we'll update the
transform. So I'd like to say translate
Y of minus2 pixels so that it would go
up a bit but then I'd like to add this
bug shadow right kind of like neon
effect. I think it looks pretty nice and
let's see how we can add it. I'll
basically grab the same
value. Okay, so it's the exact same
color I believe. Let's see.
Okay, it's the same thing but
0.3 and we update these
values. Okay, so this is how that look.
This is how we can give the hover effect
with the box shadow. And then I would
like to add the active property. So I'll
say button on the active state. We would
like to take the transform of translate
Y and bring it to the previous
state. Okay. Okay, so I'll hover over
this and click to it. It just goes to
the previous state. Now we can get the
button content. So I'll say btn content
and I'll say display of flex. So that we
can say gap of 10
pixels. But without display flex, I
think it's not going to have any gap,
right? It does not work really properly.
We'll say 100 pixels of gap. But if you
delete the display plex, you cannot
really see it. And now let's say it'll
be 10 pixels. Let's say justify content
will be centered. Otherwise, it is on
the left hand side. And then we can say
align items will be centered as well.
Here we go. Then I'll go ahead get the
contact
info. Contact dash info. I'd like to get
the margin top of 40 pixels. I'll get
padding top of 30 pixels. Border top
let's
say will be 1 pixels solid RGBA of white
which is going to be 25 sorry
255 three times and then we'll say
0.1 let's save here we go and then I'll
say display of flex but in the vertical
direction right I'll say flex direction
is going to be colum then we can give
the gap of 15 pixels so that they are
nicely separated. I'll say info item. We
would like to say display of
flex. Let's say DF. And then I'll say
align items to be
centered so that this text as well as
the icon is nicely centered. And then
we'll say gap of 15
pixels. Here we go. And I'll get the
info item
icon. And I'll say color is going to be
let's say primary color that we have.
Then I'd like to update the font size.
Let's say
1.2mm. Okay. If you don't add this align
items like I think we cannot see it yet.
But let's let's just be extreme. I'll
say 2mm. Okay. As you can tell now it is
not really centered nicely. If you say
align item
centered and accept this. Okay. Now it
is centered as you can tell. But now
we'll go with 1.2
RM. Okay. Then we can give a width such
as 20
pixels. Okay. I'll say 20
pixels. Okay. Then we'll get the info
item span. Say info item span elements
that we have where we'll update the
color itself to be text
gray. Okay. And finally, we can add some
media queries. I'll say media uh let's
say maximum width, but we need to wrap
this with brackets. Let's say 600
pixels. And below we would like to add
the form container to be padding of 25
pixels. Let's see
now. Okay. What the hell? This button is
not really looking correct. We're going
to fix
it. Okay. So I think all we have to do
just say input group is going to be grid
template columns, right? I'll just say 1
fr. Let's see now. Okay, this doesn't
really fix it. We're going to take a
look at it. Um, but we can say something
like H1 font
size is going to be equal to 1.8
RM 1.8 RM, right?
Now let's see why this is causing it
right. I
think let's see in the
index.html this
button should be outside of this
ind. Okay now it is working correctly
just like in the end result but this is
not width of
100. We can take a look at
that. And to be able to make this text
area 100% width, we can basically take
this entire message field. So just cut
it from here and put it right after this
step. Now this should be working
correctly.
Okay. So with this that's going to do it
for this entire project. We had two
different small issues where we had to
get this button, put it outside of this
div and then the same thing for the text
area which is this message field. Just
go ahead take it and put it outside of
this div. Previously it was right here
but we took it and put it
outside. So that's the entire project.
We have learned bunch of different
things with the grid to let's say box
shadow to animations. Now if you want to
change the entire theme, all you have to
do visit the style CSS file. You don't
really need to change anything here in
these styles. Just change the root uh
CSS variables. Let's say we would like
to go with a blue theme. I'll go ahead
change
them. Let's say we are going to have
this one. And if you save, now
everything is in the blue theme. So this
is the beauty of using CSS variables. So
I just bring back the previous colors. I
hope you enjoyed the entire project.
I'll see you in the next
one. All right. So welcome back. In this
section, we're going to build these
pricing cards that you can see on the
screen. This is a really popular
component that almost every single
company use nowadays. And if you ever
wondered how to build one of those, this
is what we're going to be doing in this
video. And at the very bottom of this
page, we have this testimonial component
which is also pretty popular, right? And
this entire website, this entire UI is
completely responsive. So once you hit a
certain break point, this is what you're
going to get. And then finally, one card
at a time and you can scroll to the
bottom. Everything is working without
breaking anything. All right. So if you
would like to get the screenshot here, I
have it. The link will be in the
description for this diagram. And then
for the icons, we'll be using Font
Awesome. So head over to
cdnjs.com and search for Font Awesome.
I'll copy the link, kill this website,
and put them side by
side. So I have the two different empty
files. We're going to get started with
the HTML. So let's get the boiler plate.
I'll say the title will be equal to
something like pricing cards. And I'd
like to link my CSS file. And then just
paste this link that we have just
copied. Okay. We can go into the body
and create a
container. Let's say something like
hello. I'll save and open this with the
live server that we have. Okay. So this
is the end result. Now let's go ahead
and get started with it. So I'd like to
show you the actual end result as we go
so that I can reference it. and I said
currently we are building this. I can
say something like we're currently
building this button so on and so forth.
So under the container we're going to
have a header component where we can put
the title as well as the P tag. So I
will say H1 choose your plan and let's
try to capitalize
them. Okay. Then we're going to go ahead
create a P tag where I'll say select the
perfect and you know what I'll just copy
and paste because why not? Here we go. I
just got the P tag. Right after this
header I will create the pricing cards
uh container and then we're going to
have the basic
plan. So this will be our card and it'll
have the card header initially where we
can store the icon this rocket icon the
basic um the basic text whatever the
plan is right and then the price and
finally the description okay so under
the cart header I'll say plan- icon
where I'd like to put
the I element with the class name of fas
a bracket and Then after this div, I'll
create H3. I'll say basic. And then
after the H3, I'll say price because
we're going to have three different
elements. So we're going to have a spend
with the currency um currency class. And
then I'll duplicate this twice. This
will be
amount and then the period. So either it
is monthly or yearly. Right? I'll just
say slashmon. And then we're going to
put the amount for the basic plan which
is nine. And then the currency which
will be dollars. Okay. And then after
this price we'll put the P tag with the
class name of
description. Description. Okay. I'll
copy this entire
thing. Paste this in. This is what we
have at the moment. So right after the P
tag as well as this div which is for the
cart header, right? Just go ahead shrink
this. Right after this one, we'll have
the card dash body. And then this will
get some features under the ul element.
So I'll say features. Let's put all of
them one by one. We'll have the list
item with the icon that will be for the
check mark. So I'll say class name of
fas a check. And next to it, we'll put
let's say we'll put a space and I'll say
five
projects. Okay, let's save. So this is
what we have at the moment. Now I will
go ahead and duplicate this couple of
different times. So we're going to have
for the 20 GB storage, basic support,
email notifications, advanced analytics,
and then finally the custom domain. But
these two will have different icons. So
I'll just say fa times for both of these
and they will be disabled. So I'll just
say class name of disabled. Let's copy
this and put it right here. Right. Let's
update the content. The very end one
will be custom domain and this one will
be advanced
analytics. Okay. Now we're going to
build these three. So this will be 20 GB
right I'll say 20 GB projects sorry
storage here we go if I can type it
correctly and then we'll say basic
support and finally the email
notifications and let's capitalize this
correctly okay so that's going to be for
the card body. I'll shrink this. And
finally, we'll have the card footer
which will get this button. So, I'll go
right below it. Card dash footer. That
will get the button. Let's say class
name will be btn. And we can say get
started. Okay. So, that's going to be it
for the basic plan. Let's go ahead
shrink this this entire cart. And this
is the end result. But we're going to
make that look a lot much a lot more
better. Right? So I will have my pro
plan. This is basically the same thing,
but we'll have different content as well
as a different let's say class names. So
I'll say it'll get the card as well as
the popular class name so that we can
have different styles on it. And then
we'll put the let's say popular
dashbatch which is going to be this one.
We can say
most popular, right? We will position
this absolutely to the top right corner.
And then we can have the card header
component. That will get the icon. So
it's the exact same thing. I'd like to
copy and paste. If you want to, you can
pause the video and type this out. So
under the cart header, we got the exact
same content, right? We just change the
icon. And then we have the price. This
is the pro plan. We got the currency,
amount, and period as well as the
description. And then right after the
cart header, let's go ahead and shrink
this. I'll have the features. Sorry,
we'll have the card body. Now, what I'd
like to do, just go into the basic plan,
copy the entire card body, and then
paste this in. We will just change the
content. Okay, so this will be the same.
Everything will be the same, but the
advanced analytics will not be disabled.
Let's go ahead delete that. And this
will be a check mark as well. So I'll
just say check. Here we go. And there is
nothing difference like nothing is
different than this one. We can leave
this as it is. And then at the very
bottom of this card body, we will create
a
card. We'll just say this will have a
button with the class name of btn and
also btn- accent. and I'll just say get
started. Okay, so that's going to be it
for this plan as well. Let's go ahead
and shrink this. Finally, we're going to
put the enterprise plan. And by the way,
this is the output that we
have. So, right after this one, I'll say
enterprise plan. And then we'll create
the cart class. This will get the cart
dash header thing. And I'd like to give
you the content. So this will get the
plan icon with this building icon. Then
we'll get the text. So right after the
plan icon, go ahead put the enterprise
text. Then we'll get the price as well
as the currency amount and period. Okay.
Right after this one, we are going to
put the description. So after the price,
go ahead get a p tag with the
description class. And this is the
content. And then after the cart header,
we can put the dashcart body. Sorry,
cart dash body. And then we'll put the
features. Instead of typing this out,
I'd like to get everything that we
have here uh under the
ul. So that was the pro plan. Now we're
going to put it right here under the
card body. And this will not be
disabled. It'll also be a check mark.
Okay. And then right after the card
body, we will put the card footer
component or the div I should say. We'll
say this will get the button class of
btn and then the content will be get
started. Okay. And then at the very very
bottom we would like to put the
testimonial component. So let's go ahead
and scroll to the top. I would like to
find the pricing cards. shrink this and
then we'll go ahead create the
testimonial
testimonial div and then I'd like to
have the quote as the class name I'll
have an icon which will be class of fas
a quote dash left then we would like to
put a p tag right after this I'll say p
tag you can change the content this is
what I'll have I'll copy this entire
thing paste this in and Then right after
this p tag I will create the author
class that will get an avatar as the div
with the class name and then we would
like to put an image. Now we can use the
random user me. So let me provide this
to you and I'll copy this entire URL.
Paste this in into my URL into my
browser and this is the output that we
got. If you wanted to you can change it
change this value sorry we can put
something like 14. you'll get a bunch of
different
results and this is the one that I'd
like to go with. Let's add an old tag.
I'll say this is the customer that we
have and then after the avatar I'll say
the info which is going to be this part.
We'll just say
H4 put the
[Music]
name and then we'll have a P tag that
will be their title.
Let's see. Marketing
director. Okay, so that's kind of it for
the entire markup. Next, we would like
to build the CSS file. So, let's go
ahead open this up and get started with
it. So, the first thing I'd like to do,
as always, get our base styles. I'll say
margin of zero. This is the basic reset
that we always do. Then, padding of
zero, box sizing of border box, and then
I'd like to change the font family.
Let's say it'll be equal to sense surf.
You can use anything that you wish. Now
I'd like to get some CSS variables so
that we are consistent in our code. And
now this CSS variables will be really
helpful if at the end of this project
you want to change the entire color. All
you have to do just update these CSS
variables, right? So let's say at the
end of this section you would like to go
with a yellow theme or a blue theme. All
you have to do just update couple of
different values right here. And now
instead of typing everything, I'll just
type out the very first one. Let's say
primary dash color. We can put this
value. I'll say 4 a d e 80. Now we'll
have bunch of different values. And
instead of typing them out, I have
prepared an entire GitHub gest that you
can find the link in the description. Go
ahead, scroll somewhere somewhere in at
the bottom you should find something
like
pricingcards.mmd. So copy this entire
file and paste this in. Here we go. We
got the primary color, the dark one,
light, and couple of different values as
well as some shadow values. Right, for
the box shadow, we'll be using all of
them. Now let's scroll to bottom. I'll
have the body selector and I'll say the
background color is going to be this bg
dark. Okay. Now we'll use the color. It
will be text light and if you want to
use a CSS variable, you should wrap them
with the variable as you might already
know. And then I'll say minimum height
is going to be 100 VH. Here we go. We'll
just say display of flex justify content
centered. And then align items will be
centered. Then we'll say padding will be
40 pixels to 15 pixels. And we can
change the align height could be
something like 1.6.
Okay. Now after this I'd like to select
my container. I'll say container that
will be width of 100 pixels. Sorry 100%
but the maximum width is going to be
1200 pixels. And then I'll say margin is
going to be 0 to auto. Then we can get
the header styles. I'll say header.
It'll be text align of centered. Now
it's been centered. And then we'll say
margin bottom of 50 pixels. Then I'd
like to get the header H1. Now there is
something different here. This is not
just a regular color. I'm not really
sure if it is visible from the video,
but we have a linear gradient from left
to right. So this color is a lot
different than this one. Let's see how
we can make something like this. So the
first thing I'd like to do before we get
into the colors, I'll say font size will
be 2.5 RM. And then I'll say margin
bottom will be 10 pixels. Okay. Now
we're going to get into the colors. So
I'll say background and not background
color. Notice how it should be
background because we'll be using linear
gradient. So I'll say to right we'll be
going from this color which is the
primary color that we have and to this
color which will be primary light that
we
have. Okay. So if you save this is what
we got. But we don't really want to have
this on the background. We want to have
this on the text. So we'll like the
first just say display inline block. So
it only takes the space that it needs.
And then we'll say background clip is
going to be equal to text. Now the
background is gone, right? We would like
to say color will be equal to text.
Sorry, it'll be equal to transparent.
Let's go ahead update it. Here we go.
Now it works. And if you want this to
work on every single browser such as
Safari as well, you can add the fallback
with WebKit.
say get the exact same
thing and just paste this without any
spaces. Okay, so I'll just put a
comment. Let's say this is
for
Safari.
Okay, so this is how we can get this
kind of an output. If you want to change
the colors now, we can basically go
scroll to the top. Let's say you would
like to get a blue theme. Update the
primary one. And which one did we used?
It is primary color and then the light
one. Can go ahead update it as
well. Okay. Now the entire theme has
changed but I'd like to go with these
ones. Okay. Now let's scroll to the
bottom after the H1. We're going to get
the P element. So I'll say header P tag.
I'll say color will be text gray that we
have. And then we'll say font size is
going to be 1.1 rm. I can change the max
width. Let's say it'll be 600 pixels and
margin is going to be 0 to auto. Then
I'd like to say get the pricing cards
container. Right? I'll say pricing dash
cards. And then I'll say display will be
grid. We'll say grid template columns is
going to be a repeat to auto
fit. We'll say min
max that will be 300 pixels to one
fraction. Right? And then we'll say gap
of 30 pixels. Now we would like to say
margin bottom will be 60 pixels as well.
Now currently we cannot see the effect
but if you put it like this it'll be
responsive out of the box.
Okay, after the pricing cards, I would
like to get the card itself. I'll say
the background color is going to be the
card background color that we have. And
then we'll say border
radius is going to be the border radius
variable that we have. I think it is 10
pixels. Okay, so it's 12 pixels that
we're using. If you wanted to, you can
update that value as you wish. Then I'll
say overflow is going to be
[Music]
hidden. Then we can say um position is
going to be relative and you're going to
see why. We'll say box
shadow will be this shadow medium that
we have. And then I'll say let's give
some transitions on everything 0.3
seconds as
is. Okay. So that's it. Let's also add
the height of 100%. Now we'll go ahead
get the card hover state. We will update
the transform property. Let's say
transform will be translate Y of minus
10 pixels. And I'd like to get the box
shadow. We'll say it'll be equal to the
large box shadow that we have. And then
finally the background color can change
to card hover state. Okay, let's take a
look at it. As we hover, I think it is
changing but this should be background
color. Okay, now the background color
changes as we wish. Then I'd like to get
the card header component. Say card-
header. I always say component is
because I'm using React a lot. But this
is basically a class. I should say I'd
like to get the cart header class,
right? Okay. Let's say padding will be
30 pixels. I'd like to get the text
align to be centered. And finally, let's
add some border bottom. I'd like to copy
this value and paste this in. This is
the output that we got. Now, I would
like to get the plan icon as well. I'll
say width will be 70 pixels. Same for
the height 70 pixels. And we can add a
background
gradient. Now, let's try to paste this
in. and then I'll walk you through
it. Okay. So, there's nothing to walk
you through it basically, but we have
added some degrees. You can also say
something like to right or to left to
bottom, whatever you wish. I'll go with
135°. We're going to go from this color
to this one. And we're updating the
alpha value, right? So that we can get
this kind of an output. And then I'd
like to change the border radius to be
50% so that it's a complete circle. And
then I'll say display flex and then so
that we can center this icon within
that. Right? I'll say display flex align
items to be centered. And now let's say
justify content centered as well. And we
can say something like margin of zero to
auto. And I'll give something something
like 20 pixels. Okay. so that it's
centered within this within this
container and then I would like to
select the plan icon icon itself right
the icon element not the container I'll
say font size will be 1.8 8 RM it's been
incremented and we can say the color is
going to be primary color that we have
now it is looking a lot more cleaner
then we can get the H3 I'll say font
size will be 1.5 RM we can give margin
bottom of 15 pixels okay then I'll get
the price itself I'll say margin bottom
will be 15 pixels as well then we can
get the currency so I'll go ahead say
currency Okay, it'll be equal to font
size of 1.5 RM. And then I'll say margin
right is going to be 2 pixels. It's very
tiny, but if you had 20 pixels, this is
what would happen. I'll just give two
pixels. Then I'll say color is going to
be a variable of primary color that we
have. Here we go. Now the other thing
that I'd like to do just align this to
the top. So I'll say vertical align will
be equal to top. Now in this case the
text has gone to the top but what I want
to happen is this right the currency
will go to the top. Now currently this
is not really how that work but once we
make this larger it'll work as expected.
Okay. So I hope we're going to see what
that means just in a second. Let's say
amount select this and we'll say font
size will be equal to 3.5 RM. Here we
go. This is what we got. If you delete
this part, they would be side by side.
But now this is the output that we would
like to have. And I'll say font weight
is going to be equal to
700. And then I'll say line height could
be
one. And then I'll say color is going to
be a variable of primary color. Okay.
Now we'll go ahead and get the period
itself. I'll say font size will be 1mm
and I'll say color is going to be text
gray. And after this we can select the
description itself. I'll say dot
description. Let's say font size can be
decremented a bit such as 0
95mm. And then the color is going to be
text gray as well. And then I'll select
the cart
body. Let's say this will get the
padding of 30 pixels. And then let's say
uh flex grow of one. Now why this did
not grow card body if we delete
it? I'll just bring this back. Even
though we cannot see the difference, I
think it'll be clear in a couple of
minutes. I'll say
features will be equal to list style of
none. So we can get rid of those bullet
points that we have. And then I'll say
the
features let's say dot features get the
list items. We'll say margin bottom will
be 15 pixels. Then we'll say the display
will be
flex. So that we can align items in the
center right in vertically they are
centered. Now we'll get the same thing
but the icon itself I'll say margin
right will be 10 pixels and we can say
font size will be 0.9 RM and then I'll
select the
uh the check marks specifically and then
we'll get the this cross icon. So I'll
say features LA
I so list item I and then actually the
FA check specifically right we'll say
color is going to be variable of primary
color that we have and I can duplicate
this this will be for the FA times and
this would be a color such as the danger
color I'll go with E
F444 four four right 44 double times. If
you'd like to take this and make it a
CSS variable, you can definitely do it.
So, you would just come here and you
would say
dash, let's say danger color or whatever
you would like to call and then paste
the value, then use it in your CSS
variables, right?
I mean right here, but I'll just use it
as a hard-coded value because it's not
really that important at the moment.
Now, we can select the disabled state as
well. I'll copy this. I'll say if list
item is disabled. So, let's say li is
disabled. We'll say the opacity is going
to be
0.7. And then the color is going to be
text of
gray. as you can tell. Then I'd like to
get the card footer
itself. I'll add some paddings such as
20 pixels to 30 pixels as well as the 30
pixels as well. Then we're going to get
the button itself because currently it
looks terrible. I'll get the button.
Let's say display of
block. Then I'll say width is going to
be 100%. I'll get the padding itself.
let's say 14 pixels and then font size
could be just
one. I'll get the font
weight to be 600. Text align is going to
be centered. I'll say color can be text
light and then I'll get the background
color which is going to be RGBA value of
okay this is kind of annoying but let's
type this out. We'll get the the white
color and we'll just change the alpha
value. And then I'll duplicate this. Do
the same thing for the border
itself. This will be 2
pixels solid. And then this exact same
value. And I'll say border
radius is going to be border radius
value that we have which is 12 pixels.
And then I'll say cursor is going to be
pointer. Finally, the
transition is going to be all 0.3
seconds in
ease. Okay. Now, let's get the hover
state. I'll say btn. If we are in the
hover state, we'll update the border
color to
be primary color that we have. And then
the background color. I'd like to copy
and paste this value. And like why this
did not update? This should be
btn. Okay. So this is what we have at
the moment. Working as expected. Now
this button is the accent, right? This
is how we called it. I'll say
btn dash accent. We'll select this and
I'll say the background color is going
to be variable of primary color that we
have. And then the border
color also going to be the primary
color. And finally the color itself will
be black. Okay. So this is output that
we would like to have. Now on the hover
state I'll update some stuff. Let me
copy and paste. Super simple. We'll
change the background color as well as
the border color itself. Now the other
thing we would like to do is take the
take the popular cart and scale it a
little bit. Right? It's larger than
these two. So how can we make that work?
I'll go ahead and just say get the
popular cart. I'll say transform will be
scale of
1.0.5. So it is just tiny bit but it
definitely has the effect. I'll say
border will be 2 pixels solid and the
variable of primary color that we
have. Okay. So this is what we have at
the moment. Right. Let me just put them
side by side.
Okay. Now, right after the border, I'll
just say Zindex is going to be two. So
that is always in front. Then I'd like
to get the hover state. I'll say
popular. If it is on the hover state, we
can change the transform. I'll say
translate. Y is going to be minus 10
pixels. And scale could be still 0
1.0.5.
0.5. Let's see this in
action. Okay. So, if you don't add this,
let's see what would happen in the hover
state. It goes like, can you see like
it's still going up, but it also scales
down. So, you have to say the scale
should be still the same. And then you
will let me save. And then you will take
it to translate y of
um minus 10 pixels. I hope that makes
sense. I'll just put them side by
side. Okay. Right after this hover
state, you'll we'll say popular
dashbatch. And as I said previously,
we're going to position this
absolutely to the top of 15 pixels and
let's say right of 15 pixels as well.
[Music]
Now we would like to say the background
color is going to be the primary color
that we have. And then I'll say and it
is this one by the way that we're
building. The color is going to be
black. We'll get the font size to be 0.8
RM. Font weight let's say
600. Let's say padding is going to be 5
pixels to 12 pixels. And then border
radius will be 20 pixels. Okay. And if
you want this to be always in front just
to make sure you can add the zindex such
as three. So what we have done is to set
the popular zindex to be two. And then
this is larger than this. Right? If you
don't add them, let's see what would
happen. Maybe nothing would change. But
you just want to make sure that this
batch is in front of the cart itself.
Right? You don't want this to be like
back of this card because it would be
invisible. So what you would like to do
is just add this double check where you
would put the Z-index on the popular to
be something like two and then this
would be larger than this. Okay. So
that's going to be for the cards. Now we
can build the testimonial component
itself. I'll go ahead just get the
testimonial. I'll say margin top is
going to be 60 pixels.
Does that work? Let's say 600 pixels.
Okay, it's working. Um, I'd like to get
the display of flex and justify content
to be centered. Now, I'll go ahead and
get the
code. I'd like to say maximum width is
going to be 700 pixels. Background color
could be the card BG that we
have. Let's
save. Like, is it updating? I don't
really see background color. Let's say
it'll be
red. Okay, seems like we have a typo.
Let's visit the
code. Okay, so it's actually correct.
That's strange. Now, let's say the
border color is is going to be one pixel
solid red. Okay, so it is not working
because I have a typo. This should be
code correctly. Now, let's save. We can
see the output but this should be the
variable of card background. Then right
after this background color I'll have
the border radius value under the border
dash
radius. And I think I'm missing the
semicolon and also I am missing this
variable at the like in front right
after the border radius we'll add the
padding of 40 pixels from all
directions. And I'll say position is
going to be relative. And finally, let's
give some box shadow which will be the
shadow
medium. Okay, this is what we have. Now
let's go ahead get the code icon. I'll
say color is going to be the variable of
d- primary color. Then we would like to
get the font size to be 2mm. I'll say
opacity will be decremented. We'll say
0.3. This is looking a lot more cleaner.
I think if you wanted to, you can
increase it or even delete the opacity
itself. This is what I'll have. And then
I'll say the position is going to be
absolute to the let's say top of 20
pixels and left of 20 pixels. Okay. Then
I'll go ahead and get the code P tag.
I'll say font size can be 1.1 RM. I'll
say margin bottom 20 pixels line
height and just make sure to put the
semicolon. I'll say line height will be
1.7 and let's say position will be
relative. I'll say the
padding left is going to be 15 pixels.
Then we can get the author itself. So
just say dot
author this will be width of 50 pixels.
Same for the height. Then we can get the
border radius to be rounded which is
going to be 50 pixels. I mean it's going
to be 50%. But this did not work because
this has to be the avatar itself. Right.
I'll select the author and just change
it to be display of flex and we'll say
align items to be centered. Okay. Now
this is what we have but still not
working correctly. Let's go ahead and
say overflow will be hidden. Now what is
happening is this the image overflows
the container. So that's why you cannot
wrap it. So we say if there is an
overflow just go ahead and hide it right
just hide that overflow. Now we'll just
say margin right is going to be 15
pixels to have this spacing. And I'll
say border could be 2 pixels solid and
the primary color that we have. Okay.
Still we cannot see this but we'll just
see this in a second I believe. Let's
see. Okay. So we're going to get this
kind of an output. Let's say right after
the avatar I'll get the avatar image
itself. Now let's say the width will be
100%. And we'll do the same thing for
the
height. And just to center this
correctly, I'll say object fit will be
cover. And I just realized this should
be border. That's why it did not work.
Okay, now it's working as expected.
After the image, we can select the info
H4 where we had the font size to be 1.1
RM and then margin bottom of let's say 3
pixels. And then I'll get the info p
tag. I'll say padding will be zero.
Let's see it's going to fix this
spacing. I'll say margin will be zero as
well. And let's say font size can be 0.9
RM. And then finally the primary color
will be used. Now this is the entire UI.
I'd like to make this a little bit more
responsive. So I'll go ahead select the
media queries. I'll say maximum
width 768 pixels. We would like to get
the body and just change some padding
some paddings right. I'll say petting
will be equal to 30 pixels to 15 pixels.
And then I'd like to get the header
component. I'll say margin bottom will
be 30 pixels. I'll get the header
H1. This will be font size of 2 RM. And
then I'd like to get the pricing cards.
I'll change the grid template column to
be one fraction. And then I'll say
maximum width is going to be 400 pixels.
Margin will be zero auto and 40 pixels
as well. Then I'll go ahead get the cart
as well as the
popular and I'll just say transform is
going to be
none. Okay. And then on the hover state
I'll just change the transform al bit to
be minus 5 pixels instead of 10 pixels.
That would be a bit too much for mobile
devices. And then I'll get the
testimonial. I'll say margin top will be
40 pixels. And finally for the code
we'll say 30 pixels. Okay. So this is
the entire application that we have
built. We are just missing one thing
which is this animation that we have on
the button. Right? We want this to be
infinitely working. So I'll go ahead put
them side by side and get started with
it. So we would like to create a key
frame right so that it is like it is
going infinitely. I'll just say add key
frames and I'll say the name could be
anything. I'll go with the pulse because
this is what we call this animation and
we'll have three different states. So
from the 0% we'll add something at 70%
we'll do something and finally we'll do
something else which is the 100%.
Now, if you want to use them, we'll just
select the button accent and we'll say
the animation is going to be pulse and
then 2 seconds, let's say infinite. Here
we would like to change the box shadow.
So, I'll say box shadow will be four
different times zeros and then we'll say
rgba of this color. So, instead of
typing this out, let me please copy and
paste and you can pause the video, type
this out. I have already done this. Now,
initially this will be the value. And
then we are going to change this to 10
pixels. So it's the exact same value
with a different opacity. And then
finally at
100% we will add this value. Again we
don't really have any pixels but also no
opacity at
all. Okay. Now this is how that work.
For a split second, we are able to see
the box shadow and then it's going to
disappear. Okay, so with that, that's
going to be it for the entire project.
Now, if you wanted to change the theme,
all you have to do just scroll to the
top, find your primary color, right?
Let's say I want to have kind of like a
pink theme. I'll go ahead select this
value and change it to this one. And
let's have one more. I'll go with this
light theme. Now, as you can tell, the
entire application has changed. All you
have to do maybe just update this
background color, but you get the point.
This is the video of using CSS
variables. I'll do Ctrl + C to go to the
previous
[Music]
state.
Okay, so that's the entire project. I
hope you enjoyed it. I'll see you in the
next one. Okay, so welcome back to the
section. This is what we're going to
build. This is what we call the team
members showcase, which is something
really popular and really common where
the companies put their team members on
a separate section. And this is exactly
what we're going to be building with the
avatar, the full name, title, as well as
the biography. And we can even add some
social links. And this will be
completely responsive. So we're going to
have three different columns in large
screens. And then medium will have two
columns at a time. and then just one
column at a time. And this section at
the very bottom, this is what we call
the CTA, which stands for call to
action. So there is no JavaScript at
all. It is HTML CSS only. And I think
this is a great project to to practice
your CSS skills. And if you want to get
the screenshot and build it by yourself,
here here I have it. And the link will
be in the description for completely
free. Now the first thing that I'd like
to do get the icons and for this we'll
be using font awesome. So I'll visit
cdnjs.com. Let's search for font
awesome. You can use any other
alternatives but this is the one that
I'll be using font awesome. Right. I'll
go ahead get the link. Let's copy it and
then paste it into into our HTML file.
Speaking of which, we'll create that and
then let's say style CSS. First let's
get started with the markup. So I'll get
the boiler plate code. Let's say this is
the team members
showcase link our CSS file and then I'll
put the link that we have just copied
for font awesome. I'll just say hello
save and let's say open with live server
and then we're going to put them side by
side. Here we go. Now I'd like to open
up the end result. This is what we have
here. You can see the title says end
result.
so that we can do some
references here. I'll just create a
header component and I'll get started
with this H1 that says meet our team and
then I'll create a P tag. This will be
the description and I am too lazy to
type this out. I'll copy and paste. If
you wanted to, you can pause the video
and type this out. Then we would like to
have this team grid. Now we'll have six
different team members. Let's say team
member one and the content will go into
the card div. Now this will have a card
dash top. Let's duplicate it and it'll
have card bottom. Let's first get
started with the top section. Now what
you have seen here this is the
background and we will create this as a
separate div. So I'll say
profile-bg. It's not going to have any
content like it'll be empty and we're
going to position this and then give it
a width and height and then we'll have
the profile- image. This will get the
image component or the image element and
for the source we will be using the
random users. I'd like to copy the URL
paste this in. So you can type this out
random user.mme api
portraitsman32.jpeg. And if you paste
this in, you will be able to see
different results depending on the
value. So I'll go with 12. This is what
we have. So on and so forth. Okay, let's
put them side by side. Once again, let's
save. This is what we have. Let's put an
alt such as team
member on this image. And after this
image and then after this div, I'll go
ahead create the H3 which is going to
hold the username. So I'll say Alex
Morgan right after this H3 I'll put P
the P tag I'll say class will be RO uh
let's say it's founder and
CEO okay right after this div I think my
mouse died I was going to say no it is
working so right after the card top will
go under the card bottom and I'll put a
p tag let's say this will get the class
name of bio And I am too lazy to type
this out as well. I'll paste this in.
You can change this and put it anything
that you wish. And then um after the P
tag, I will create a div with
social links class. Now we'll have three
different links. This is not going to
take us to any website. I'll just leave
it as a hashtag, right? A hash and I'll
say class name. Let's say this will be
social- icon. Now let's put the actual
icon. Let's say class name of FAB FA
LinkedIn- N. Okay, let's save. Now, uh
let's duplicate this twice. One and two.
This will be Twitter, right? And then
the very last one will be
GitHub. Let's save and take a look at
the end result. This is what we have.
Now, we don't really want to type this
out six different times, right? It's the
exact same thing. All you have to do
copy it, paste it and then change the
value. Now there is no need to waste any
time. So I have prepared an entire
GitHub just let me get this. Here we go.
Um, okay. So you should be able to find
this link in the description. Go ahead
find the team members showcase. So copy
the entire
markup. And we have some CSS code that
we're going to get into in a bit. But
basically, this is the entire team grid
that we have. Okay, so this has no logic
at all, just pure markup. That's why I'd
like to copy and paste. I'll delete this
entire team grid and paste this in.
Let's save and take a look at the
output. Okay, so this is the exact same
data that we have right
here. And now we would like to put the
CTA section. So, I'd like to scroll to
the top. I'll shrink the team grid
component. So, we have this div. We'll
shrink this and we'll create this team
dash CTA which is going to take an H2
that says want to join our team question
mark and then P tag. Let's say we are
always and copy and paste. We are all
always copying and pasting. Here we go.
And then we'll just put a button or a
link that will take us to nowhere. But
the class name should be CTA button. And
CTA stands for call to
action. I'll say view open
positions. Okay. So this is the entire
markup. Next we are going to build the
CSS. So I'll go into this file, shrink
the left hand side and get into this
file. Okay. Okay, so the first thing we
would like to do is to get our basic
resets. Now, I know that this is kind of
repetitive and it might sound a bit
annoying, but we have to do it if you
want to get rid of all the default
paddings, margins, and add this box
sizing of border box. We have explained
this in the previous sections, so I'll
not go over it once again in this
project. Let's save. This is what we
got. And I'd like to update the font
family to be, let's say, sans serif. As
always, if you wanted to, you can change
this and make something completely
different if you wish. Now, I would like
to get some CSS variables. I'll get my
root element. And instead of typing them
out, I don't really want to waste any
time. So, that's why I have prepared
this entire list. So, just go ahead find
the team members
showcase. Um, this is the HTML that we
have copied. But I have a complete CSS
code around 10 lines of code. Let's
paste this in. So we have bunch of
different colors for primary for the
text and we have some values for border
radius. We have some box shadow values
and then couple of different values as
well. So we'll be using all of them in
the incoming minutes. So we'll kill all
these websites. Okay. Now let's get
started with the body element. I'll say
body let's say background color will be
equal to variable of bg dark. I'd like
to get the color that will be text
light. And I'll say min height is going
to be 100 ph. And then I'd like to get
the display flex. Let's say justify
content centered. Align items to be
centered. Let's give some paddings. I'll
say 50 pixels to 15 pixels. Finally,
line height of
1.6. Okay. Now, we would like to get the
header
element. I'll say text align will be
centered. Then I'd like to say margin
bottom of 60
pixels. Okay. So, we'll go ahead get the
header
H1. Let's say font size is going to be
2.7
RM, which is this one H1. Now I can see
that everything is side by side. I think
we forgot to wrap everything with the
container component. So I will visit
index.html. Okay. Right after the body,
I'll create the container dev. Let's
copy this and just put it right before
the body closing tag. Now I'd like to go
into the style. CSS and I'll select the
container itself. Let's say the width is
going to be 100%. And the maximum width
could be something like 1,200 pixels.
Now, if we go into the larger screens,
this is the maximum width it'll take.
So, if you wanted to, you can inspect
it. Let's find the container. Right? So,
here we can see, just notice here at the
top, just take a look at it. We have the
pixels of width. So this is the maximum
val maximum value that it can take.
Okay. So with this in mind, let's put
them side by side once
again and just move forward. And I'd
like to add one more thing. I'll just
say margin of zero from top and bottom
but auto from left and right so that it
is centered. Then I'll get the H1 that
we already have. It is this element.
Let's say margin bottom will be 15
pixels.
Okay, I'll say
background. Now, it should be
background, not background color because
we will give this linear gradient. I am
not really sure if it is visible from
the video, but this color and this one
is completely different. So, we'll go to
the right from this one to this color.
Okay, let's see. I'll say background
will be linear gradient. You can either
say
90° or you can say to right and I'll say
go with this color like from the primary
color to this one and say variable of
primary
light. Okay. Now if you save you're
going to see that background has been
updated. So we can fix this. I'll say
background
clip is going to be text. That's the
first thing. Now we'll just say color
should be
transparent. Okay, now this has been
fixed. Now we would like to add the
support for this Safari as well. I'll
say
webkit and I'll just get this exact same
value. Paste this in. Let's say it'll be
text and I'll just add a
comment. Let's say for
Safari as well, right?
Okay, after the color I'll say display
should be inline block and then I'll say
position will be relative. Okay, now
I'll go ahead get the after element so
that I can put this underline in the
middle of the
H1. So I'll say
header H1 and let's get the after
element. content will be nothing which
is an empty string and we'll say
position is going to be absolute to the
let's first say width of we can go with
any value I'll go with 60 pixels let's
say height will be 4 pixels and then
I'll say
background can be variable of primary
gradient now it is at the top right I'll
just say bottom will be minus 10 pixels
and then we'll I'd like to center this.
So I'll say left
50%. Okay. Now this is still not
centered. It is starting from the 50%.
I'd like to take this 50% to the left.
So I'll say transform translate X is
going to be minus 50%. Here we go. Now
it is centered. Let's add some border
radiuses. I'll go with 2 pixels. Okay.
So that's going to be for the after
element. Now we can get the header p
tag. I'll say color is going to be text
gray. We'll be using the CSS variable.
I'll say font size will be 1 1.1 RM.
Then we'll get the maximum width to be
600 pixels. Let's say margin will be
zero to auto. So if we do not add this,
what would happen? I think it would not
be centered correctly. But let's bring
this back. Save. Okay, now it is
centered.
and then I'll say margin top of
something like 20 pixels. Okay, so
that's going to be for the header P tag.
Now I'd like to select the team
grid. Team dash grid. I'll say display
will be as you can tell it'll be grid.
We'll say grid template columns. I'll
use repeat of auto fill and
minmax 280 pixels to 1 FR and then I'll
say gap of let's say 30 pixels margin
bottom of 60 pixel 60 pixels. Now let's
see if this is responsive already. Let's
select the correct one. Okay, so it's
already responsive as you can tell
thanks to this minmax method.
Okay, now we'll get the team
dashcard. Let's say the background color
will be card bg and then we'll get the
border radius which will be the border
radius value that we have. So it is 12
pixels. But if you wanted to let's say
you want to make this to be 20 pixels.
So we can go right here and update it.
Okay, but this is the value that I'll be
using which is 12 pixels. Now I'll say
overflow will be hidden. Then now why is
this why is this the case? So if you
delete this now here you can see image
is overflowing the card. So we say if
there is if there is any overflows right
if there are any overflows just get rid
of that and hide it. Now we cannot
really see that overflow. I hope that
makes sense. Now we can add some
transition. I'll add it on everything.
0.3 seconds and ease then I'll say box
shadow will be variable of shadow MD
which is going to be this value let's
say shadow
MD okay so is this one and we're using a
CSS variable so that our code is
consistent right if we wanted to use
shadow MD we can copy it paste it here
if we wanted to use it in this
component okay right after this one I'll
say height will be 100% and let's say
display will be
relative sorry position should be
relative right on display we don't
really have
relative okay I'll say position is going
to be relative and then I'll say display
will be flex and flex direction is going
to be
colum now I would like to add a hover
state on the card so that it can be
translated to the top and there are
element of box shadow. I don't really
know if it is visible from the video,
but there is definitely a box shadow
going on. So, let's shrink
this and go into the team cart hover
state. Transform could be translate Y of
- 8 pixels. And then I'll say box shadow
is going to be shadow
large. Okay. And then I'll get the team
cart on hover state. We would like to
get the profile background. I'll say
profile-bg. And we are going to scale
this up. I'll say
transform scale 1.1 because if you take
a look at the end result, if you hover
over this background also scales. So
this is something that we would like to
do. Okay. Let's save and move forward.
And by the way, let's open up our own
version. Currently, it's been like
translated, but we cannot see the
background. So, we're going to get into
it. First, I'd like to say select the
card top element. Position is going to
be relative. Let's say petting top is
going to be 70 pixels. Petting bottom
could be 30 pixels. Pix align could be
centered. Okay. So, this is what we
have. And I'd like to add the zindex of
one. Then I'll say profile
dashbg. Position is going to be
absolute. Let's say top of zero. Left of
zero. And then I'll say right of zero as
well. And then I'll get the height.
Let's say 120 pixels. We can add the
background color as
[Music]
well. So I'll use the primary gradient.
Let's save. We cannot see anything. Um,
why this is the case? It is profile
dashbg. Is it because maybe we don't
have the zindex yet? Let's test this
out. I'll say minus one or maybe 10.
Okay, so for some reason we cannot see
this. Um, profile
dashbg. Let's see. Do we have this
element on team grid? we have
profile-bg so I think we are using a
gradient and we are saying background
color that's why is it it doesn't work
let's say just background here we go it
is working as expected now if we wanted
to take this back of the image right
I'll say z index of minus one okay so if
you do not add this it will um how do we
call it like it would overflow the image
itself but it will just take it to the
one level behind. Okay, so we got the
Z-index and let's give the transition to
be on the transform because we are
scaling this up, right? I'll say
transform 0.4 seconds and ease. Now, if
you hover over this, as you can tell,
the
background is scaling up a little
bit. Okay, then I'll get the profile
image. Let's say width is going to be
100 pixels, height will be 100 pixels
and we'll say border radius to be 50%.
So that it can be rounded. Um currently
it doesn't. Maybe maybe because we have
the overflow of hidden. I was going to
say maybe we are missing overflow of
hidden. Now with this added it is
working as expected. Then we can add
some margins. I'll say margin from the
top, right, and left and from the
bottom. Okay, now it's been centered.
And then we can say border is going to
be four pixels solid and it'll take this
card the background. Okay, then we can
say something like position will be
relative on the image container itself.
Now we're going to select the image.
I'll say profile image image because I
don't really know if you remember but
this is the container that we have. This
is the actual
image. Okay. I'll say width is going to
be 100%. Same for the
height and I'll say object fit of
cover. Okay. So this is nicely centered
and we can add some transition on the
transform. Let's say 0.3 seconds and
ease. Okay, I'll go ahead get the team
card on hover
state profile dash image and I'll select
the image. We would like to just say
transform will be scaled up
1.1. Okay. So this is how the effect
happens. Basically when we hover over
the card the profile image is being
scaled
up and we have this beautiful effect.
Then we would like to select the H3 on
the card top. So I'll say card dash top.
Let's select the H3. I'll say font size
will be 1.4 RM. Margin bottom of 5
pixels. And then font weight could be
600 just like this. And then I'll get
the
roll update the color to be a variable
of primary color. Here we go. And I'll
get the font size to be 0
uh
0.95 RM. And then font weight could be
500. I'll get the card. The
bottom class. Let's say padding is going
to be 20 pixels from the top, 25 pixels
right and left and 25 pixels from the
bottom. Okay. Then we would like to add
the flex row of one. And then I'll get
the display of flex flex direction of
column. Let's save. This is what we
have. And I'll say justify content to be
spaced between. And then finally I'll
say border top is going to be 1 pixels
solid variable of border light. Okay.
Now I'll go ahead get the bio. We'll say
color will be text
gray. The font size let's update it to
be 0.95 RM. We can say the margin bottom
will be 25 pixels. Flex grow is going to
be one. And finally the line height
could be
1.6. Okay. And then I'd like to scroll a
little bit. I will select the social
length. I'll say display of flex so that
we can give some gap of 15 pixels. And
I'll just say justify content will be
centered. Okay. And then I'll select the
social icon itself. Let's say display of
flex justify content centered. align
item centered we'll say width will be 36
pixels. Same for the height and then we
can get the border radius to be
50%. Okay. Then I'll say um text
decoration is going to be none so that
we can get rid of this underline. Okay.
I'll update the let's say background
color that will be equal to background
overlay. Okay. So this is the background
that we are building. That's why we said
give some height and width and height.
Otherwise, this is how it would look
like. And if you do not add the border
radius, it's going to be a square. Okay.
After the background color, we can add
the color to be text light just like
this one. And finally, I'll just add
some transitions to be on everything.
0.3 seconds. And let's use ease. And
then I'd like to update the hover state.
So I'll say social icon on hover. We
would like to get the background color
to be updated to the primary color that
we have. Then I'll say the color is
going to be text gray. And finally we
can give the transform of translate Y.
That's going to be 3 minus 3 pixels.
Let's save and give it a go. When we
hover over this, this is what we got.
Now I think color is not really visible.
So we can update it on the hover state.
Let's say this will be
dark. Okay. Now this is a lot more
readable and accessible. Okay. Now let's
move on with the CTA section because at
the moment we have built all of our
cards working
properly. Okay. Now we're going to build
this section.
So I will select the
team-cta class and I'll say text align
would be centered and let's scroll to
the
bottom so that we can see it in action.
I'll say margin top is going to be 30
pixels. Let's say padding will be 40
pixels as
well just like this. And then I would
like to update the background color to
be variable of background overlay. Then
I'll get the border radius value that I
already
have just like this one. And finally,
let's say not finally but couple of
different things. So we would like to
say position will be relative, overflow
is going to be hidden and then box
shadow will be shadow
MD. Okay, now we are good to go. Then
I'd like to add this kind of like UI
where we have the how do we call it like
kind of like border top but I'll be
doing this with the after element or
like we have used after element a lot.
Let's go ahead use the before element.
Let's say team
CTA let's get the before sudo element.
We can add the content of nothing. If
you add something let's see what'll
happen. It'll just add it'll be added
before to this component itself. Now we
don't really want to have any content.
This will have the position of
absolute top of zero left of zero. We
can add the background not background
color but background because we'll say
variable of primary gradient and then we
can get the width of 100 pixels sorry
100% height of let's say height will be
5 pixels. Okay, this is what we got.
It's working as expected. I would like
to get team CTA H2 update the font size
to be 1.8 8 RM and then I would like to
get the margin bottom of 15 pixels.
Let's say color is going to be variable
of primary light. Okay. Then I'll get
the team CTA P
[Music]
tag where I'd like to say color is going
to be text gray. Here we go. I would
like to get the maximum width. Let's say
maximum width will be 500 pixels. And
let's try to center this. Let's say
margin zero auto and 25 pixels. Then I'd
like to go into the CTA
button. Let's say display is going to be
inline
[Music]
block. I'd like to get the padding that
will be 12 pixels to 35
pixels. Pixels it should be. Okay. and
we'll say the background will be
updated. Again, background not
background color because we'll use the
primary
gradient. Now, I'd like to get rid of
this text decoration of underline. I'll
just say none. Let's update the color
itself. This will be variable of text
dark. This is what we have. Right after
the color, I'll say font weight is going
to be 600. So, that is bold. And I'll
say font size could be 1 RM. Then I'll
go ahead add the border radius of 30
pixels. And then let's say
transition will be on everything 0.3
seconds. And let's use ease in and out
this time because why not? I'll add the
box shadow to be 0 to 5 pixels 15 pixels
and then variable of shadow color
primary. Then I would like to add the
hover state on this CTA button. Let's go
ahead select it. I'll say on the hover
state as always I'll say transform of
translate Y of minus 3 pixels and then
box shadow will be updated. Let's say 0
to 8 pixels. 20 pixels variable will be
shadow color primary
hover. Okay. So this is how that look. I
think pretty clean and sick. And with
this we are pretty much done with the
entire project. But I'd like to add some
media queries just to make this
completely responsive. I'll say maximum
width of 768
pixels. We would like to we would like
to add some additional styling. I'll say
header is going to be margin bottom of
40 pixels. I would like to select the
header
H1 and update the font size to be
2.2mm and then I'll get the team grid
gap will be updated. Let's say 20
pixels. And I'll say team CTA.
Padding is going to be 30 pixels to 20
pixels. And let's say team CTA H2.
That's going to be equal to font size of
1.5 RM. And then we'll be even more
responsive. I'll say media get the max
width 480
pixels. So below to it and like this
value and below to this value we would
like to say body. will have the padding
of 30 pixels to 15 pixels. We can get
the header H1. I'll copy this value and
even decrement it more. That's going to
be equal to 1.9 RM. And let's get the
profile
image. Let's say width is going to be 90
pixels. Same for the
height. And I'll say card top of age
three. font size will be 1.3 area and
finally the team
CTA get the padding of 2 and 5 pixels to
15 pixels. Okay, so these are definitely
optional. You don't have to add it but
I'll just leave it here in case you want
to have this working completely
responsive. Okay, so this is how that
work. This is the entire project that we
have built. Now, let's say you want to
change the color theme. All you have to
do just scroll to the top and change
these values to anything that you wish.
Right? If you want to go with a green
color, you could update all these values
with some green colors. But I'll use
this beautiful purple theme that we
already
have. Okay. So, that's the entire
project. I hope you enjoyed it. I'll see
you in the next one. Okay. Hey, so
welcome back. In this section, we're
going to build a recipe finder
application. I'd like to give you a
quick demo before we get started with
it. So, I'll say let's search for
chicken. We got different results. Here
we can see. Let's click to one of them.
We'll even get more details such as the
instructions, the ingredients, and even
a YouTube video link. For a split
second, I'll open this up. I think we'll
get some
ads. Okay. So, but this is the actual
video that is working as expected. Then
you can click to the other recipes and
UI will be updated. And then we can
scroll to the top, search for anything
that we wish. I'll just say egg. Okay.
Now, all these recipes are coming from a
service. It has both a free plan and
premium plan. We'll be using the free
plan, right? This is what we call an
API. If you don't know what that means,
I'll explain it pretty quickly on a
diagram. But basically, you can use the
free plan if you are building this
during development or if it is for
educational use. This is exactly what
we'll have in this video. So, we don't
really need to pay anything. Okay. So,
they have a bunch of different
endpoints. If you don't know what that
means, once again, I'll explain. But
basically when you when you put chicken
and click to this button we got some
results right but what is actually
happening behind the scenes let's see so
they have search meal by name I'll copy
this URL copy this endpoint now when you
say chicken right you are sending a
request to this endpoint but the search
query is equal to chicken okay so this
is the output this is the results that
you get and then we are displaying it on
UI. So here we have chicken hendy
chicken kangi right I don't know how you
pronounce it but this is the exact same
data. So chicken kangi chicken I don't
know how do you read it but as you can
tell it is the exact same data. So we
are sending a request to this endpoint
and we are getting a response. So we are
displaying it right here and we'll see
how to do it in code and then we have
another request to a different endpoint
where we do a lookup right I'll click
this we got the details so this is
another request let's see they have this
lookup
um like there is the lookup endpoint so
what you do you pass the ID of that meal
let's do it pretty quickly so here I'll
go ahead add the ID
chicken, I don't know, car. I'll paste
this
in. Okay, so this is the exact same
meal, but we got even more details about
uh let's say like the
uh ingredients like we got the
instructions, so on and so forth, and
even a YouTube
video. Okay, so I hope all that makes
sense. We'll be using them. Now, if you
don't know what is an API, let's say it
pretty quickly um and then we'll just
jump into code. So, what is an API in
the first place? It stands for
application programming interface, which
sounds absolutely complicated, but in
simple terms, an API lets two programs
to talk to each other, right? And here
is exactly what we have. We have our own
program where we would like to talk with
another program with another service. So
it allows you to get or send data
between your app and another service.
And this is exactly what we have from
our service. We would like to like uh we
would like to send a request and get
some data from a different service. And
this will be possible thanks to an API.
Okay. And this API is built by the ML
DB. So you don't really build it. All we
have to do just use it. Okay. So I hope
all that makes sense. Now we can talk
about API support for hours. But if we
have to keep it simple, this is what it
is in its core. Okay? But now this will
take a bit time to get into the API,
right? It'll take us some time because
first we have to build the HTML and then
CSS and then finally get into JavaScript
where we can send requests to this API.
Okay, so I have an empty folder. The
first thing I'd like to do just get the
cdnjs.com and grab the font awesome link
because we will use some icons in our
application like this one um for the
ingredients so on and so forth.
Okay, I'll just even put them side by
side. Let's get started with the HTML.
I'll zoom in, get the boiler plate, and
I'll say recipe
finder app. And then let's link our CSS
file. Get the recipe finder
URL. Sorry, this is the font awesome
URL, not recipe finder. And then we can
create a container right here within the
body. And then I'll get my header
component which is going to be this
part. And as you can tell our
application is completely responsive. So
we'll even make this app to be
completely responsive. Right? So this is
the part that we are building which is
the header component itself. So I'll
have each one and I'll say get an icon
where we would like to say fas a utin
cells. So this will give you this icon
and then right next to it I'll give one
space and I'll say recipe finder. Now
let's try to run this um let's try to
run this with a live
server. I think I'll get a warning but
it is working as expected.
Okay, right after this H1, I'll have a P
tag. Let's say find delicious recipes
from around the
world. And then right after the header
component, I'll get this P tag with the
link. Let's say
API-link. I'd like to add this data from
the mail API. We'll say data from and
this will be a link so that we can take
them to this URL. I'll copy it. Paste
it. This is what we have. For the text,
I'll say the meal DB. And I'd like to
add an emoji. So, let's say
cook. Here we go. Okay. So, this is the
output that we have at the moment. And
right after this p tag we'll go ahead
and just say search dash container where
we'll have the input that will be type
of text. Let's say the ID will be search
dash input and then I'll say placeholder
is going to be search for meals or
keywords. Okay. So after this input I'll
put a button where we can add the id
that will be
search-b and then let's say search will
be the text. Right after this search
container we will put the error
container itself. Now this will be
hidden by default. Let's say
class sorry this should be ID by the way
not class. This is going to be ID. And
then the class will be um hidden by
default. Now we are going to get errors
if we search for something that does not
exist. Right? So we got an error. And by
the way, by the way, let's say back to
recipes. So I'll just refresh and search
for something that does not exist. This
is the output that we're going to get.
And this container will be hidden by
default. Once we have an error only,
then we will display it. So this is what
we have for the content. We can say P
tag of this no meals
found try
another search term. Now we can actually
like leave this content completely empty
but this is what what I'll have by
default and then we can change this
within our JavaScript code. Now finally
we can add another thing which will be
the result heading. So let's search for
something like egg which is existed. So
we're going to get this title, right?
I'll say
um have a dev with the ID of result
heading and the content will be empty at
the moment. Then we'll have the
meals ID which is going to be the meals
container. Okay. And then finally the
details. Right? If you click to one of
them, it'll open this up where we have
the details. So I'll say it'll be meal
dash details. Let's give the class name.
By default, it'll be hidden. But if we
click to one of them, it will it'll be
visible, right? And then I'll get a
button. Let's say ID will be
back dashbt, which is this button. And
then we can give it a let's say we'll
give the icon which will be class name
of fas f a arrow- leftft and for the
content I'll say back to
recipes. Okay. Right after the button
we'll have the div with the class name
of
meal details
content. Okay. This will be empty as
well. So that's going to bed for the
entire markup. This is how that look at
the moment. Um we'll just make it look a
lot more cleaner. Just before we get
into the CSS part, I'd like to get the
script file linked. Let's say
script.js. Okay. So now that we have
this seted up, we can go into the
style.css and get started with it. So
the very first thing that I'd like to
add is my basic reset. I'll go ahead
paste this in and then I'd like to get
my color palette. I'll put them under
the root. That will be my CSS variables.
Now, instead of typing them out, I have
prepared an entire GitHub just that you
can find the link in the description.
Just go ahead and scroll and find the
recipefinder.md file and copy this color
palette and paste this in right here.
Okay, so we have a primary color, dark,
light, and couple of different values as
well. Then I'll get the body element.
I'd like to say um font family will be
updated to sense serif. You can use
something else. Then we can get the
background color that will be background
light. And then color is going to be
text dark. And then I'll say color is
sorry the line height is going to be
1.6. Okay. So that's going to bid for
the very first very first selector. And
then we can get the container
itself. Let's say the width is going to
be 100%. And then the maximum
width. Okay, let's try to put them
correctly. Max width could be something
like 1,000
pixels. And then I'll say margin will be
zero to auto. And the padding is going
to be 2M to 1 RM. Okay. Then we'll go
ahead get the header
itself. That will be text align of
centered. And I'll say margin bottom of
2 RM. Then we can get the H1 that will
be font size of 2.2 RM. And then the
color is going to be primary color that
we have. And then I'll say margin bottom
will be 0.5 RM. Here we go. And I'll get
the icon itself. I'll say margin right
could be something like 10 pixels. Okay.
Then I'll get the header P tag. Let's
say header get the P tag. That will have
the opacity of let's say
0.7. If you want you can delete that but
this is what I'll have. And then I will
also update the color to be text
dark. Okay. Then I'll get the search
container. Let's say display will be
flex. Then I'll say margin bottom will
be 2mm. Here we go. And I'll say gap
will be 10 pixels. Max width is going to
be 500 pixels. And we can say margin is
going to be from the left of zero and
from the right zero as well. And let's
actually say auto instead of zero. It'll
be centered correctly in a second. So
I'll save and let's move on. We'll get
the input that is type of text
specifically. So I'll say where the type
is equal to text. We would like to
select that input and I'll say flex is
going to be equal to one. Okay. Now it
is taking the entire space. And then
we'll say padding is going to be 10
pixels to 16
pixels. Let's say 16 pixels. And I'll
say font size will be 1m. Then we can
say border radius is going to be the
border radius value that we have. Then
right after this I'll add a border that
is 1 pixel solid and this color that is
ddd. And I'll say background color will
be the background that we have. And then
color will be text
dark. And I can say outline will be
none. Okay. So this is the output and
I'm really happy with it. Now I'd like
to select the focus state on this input.
I'll say if it is focused go ahead
update the border color to be primary
color.
Okay. And then we can select the button
and try to update
it. I'll say the background color will
be updated to the primary color that we
have. And then we can add the color to
be white. Let's say border will be
none. Okay, this is what we have. And
then I'll add some border radiuses.
let's say variable of border radius
value that we have and I think it is
either 10 pixels
um or is it even 8 pixels okay after the
border radius I'll say padding is going
to be equal to 0 to 20 pixels then we
can add some font size of
1mm let's say font weight is going to be
600 so it's a little bit more bold and
then I'll say cursor is going to be
pointer and then finally some transition
I'll say it'll be equal to the v
variable that we have let's say
transition okay now we'll add the hover
state where we would like to change the
background color which is going to be
equal to primary dark okay so this is
how that work now we would like to get
the result heading and let me grab this
value paste this in and we'll go through
So we have the result heading, the text
is centered, we have the margin, bottom,
font size, and then the color. Then
right after the result heading, I'll
select the meals dash container. And
I'll say display will be grid. Let's say
display grid. Grid template columns will
be repeat of let's say auto dash fill.
And we'll say minmax of 250 pixels to
one fraction. And then let's give it a
gap like 1.5 RM. And then we can get
started with the meal itself. I'll say
the background color will be equal to
cart bg. And then the border radius
value. Let's say box shadow is going to
be equal to shadow variable that we
have. And then overflow will be hidden.
Then we can get the
transition cursor is going to be equal
to pointer and then the position will be
equal to relative. Now on the hover
state, I'd like to transform this. Now
let's see the end result. When you when
you hover over these items, they are
just translating to the top by minus 5
pixels. And we have some box shadow
going on as well. Right here we can set
it on hover state. So this is exactly
what we have just added. Then we can
select the
meal image. We'll say width is going to
be 100%. The height is going to be 180
pixels and then the object fit will be
equal to cover. Okay. So we can save
this and then I'll say dash sorry dot
meal dash info that will be getting
padding of 1mm and then we'll get the
meal
title. Let's say font size is going to
be equal to
1.1m. We'll get the margin bottom of 0.5
RM and then color is going to be text
dark. So this is the mail title that we
have just built, right? It is this uh
component that we have in our code and
then after the mail title we can get the
mail category which will be this one
that you have seen. So I'll go ahead
paste this in instead of typing this
out. It is super simple. We just have
the display of inline block. We have a
background color which is this primary
light and then we have the color some
paddings font size border radius so that
it is rounded and then some margin
bottom. Okay. And then we can get the
meal details which is going to
be this component. Right? This is what
we call the meal details container
itself. Right? I'd like to select that
one where we had the ID of meal details.
So we'll give this background some
border radiuses so that it is rounded
some box shadow padding and margin from
top and bottom with two RM and then we
can update the back button. So I'll go
ahead paste this in and walk you through
it. We'll give some margin bottom. We'll
add the background color so that it is
transparent. We'll add the color itself,
some borders and then some paddings.
Then on hover state we are going to
update the color as well as the
background color. So this is exactly
what we have and then we can get the
details content. Now we would like to
center everything right but we want them
to be in the colum direction. So as you
can tell we have one at a time that is
going on in the column direction. So I'd
like to put this
code. I'll say meal details content flex
direction will be column and it'll be
centered. Then we can get the image
itself. So this will be maximum width of
400 pixels. Okay. I'll just paste this
in some border radiuses and some margin
bottom. Now let's get the title which is
this one. that will take the color of
primary some font size margin bottom and
text align. So I am just copying and
pasting these styles because they are
super simple and we don't really want to
waste that much of time, right? So I'd
like to get the category as well. We'll
say margin bottom and text would be
centered. Now we can get the span
itself. This is what we'll have. And if
you remember we had the span or do we
have it? Let's see the
category. Okay, so I think we don't
really have this span at the moment. But
once we take this data from the API and
once we display it within this
div, we will just have the content
within a span, right? So for the
category specifically, so it'll make
sense once we get into the JavaScript
part. Okay, so these are just some basic
styling and let's get let's get the
class for the instructions as well.
We'll get the
H3 where we update the margin bottom
only and then we'll say the ingredients
list which is going to be this list that
we have and then we can get the list
items as well as their icons. So you can
pause the video, type them out. Really
there is nothing complex other than
background colors, border radiuses,
margin bottoms, pettings, so on and so
forth. I don't really want to waste that
much of time where I'd like to give you
these classes. And if you even want to,
you can copy the entire style.css file
from the source code and just jump into
the JavaScript section. And then we
would like to get the YouTube link which
will have this background color of red.
And then we will update the icon where
we would like to give some margin right
of 8 pixels. Okay. And then we can get
the error container itself updated as
well. Right? Because let's take a look
at it. If you put something that does
not exist, this error container will
will be shown. And we would like to have
these classes. And then I would like to
have the API link as well which is this
container right we would like to style
this. So I'll paste this in. Let's save.
This is how that look at the moment.
Let's get the link within the API link
the a tag. Okay. So it's been updated.
Now we would like to add the hidden
class which is going to be display of
none. And some elements have the hidden
class such as this one. If you get rid
of that, it'll be visible. But by
default, we don't really want this to be
visible. Right? Okay. So now everything
is done. All we have to do just add some
responsive styling, some responsive
design thanks to the media queries. So
we have the search container has been
updated, the search button and some of
these classes. Okay, let's save. This is
the entire uh the entire CSS file that
we had to build. Now we'll get into the
JavaScript file and actually interact
with this API. So the first thing we
would like to do is to get our DOM
elements. So let's say search input and
we can say document dot getelement by id
and then we'll pass the id which is
going to be equal to search dash input.
Now instead of typing out every single
element I have prepared an entire list
that you can find it from the github
gest. So just go ahead copy these DOM
elements under the
recipefinder.m and then paste this in.
Okay. Now the other thing that we would
like to do is to create some uh
variables. So I'll say con base URL and
I'll I'll explain what that means and
why do we need this in the first place.
So whenever we send a request let's see
let's see the documentation. So whenever
we send a request as you can tell this
part is exactly the same right? If you
want to source something, if you want to
list all the meals, if you want to, you
know, get a random meal, so on and so
forth, every single time you need to
type this part, which is our base URL.
So, let's create it under a variable.
Um, I think I'll go ahead copy
this, paste this in. Okay, this is what
we have. And just notice how we have a
slash at the very end. And then we we
will need two different URLs which is
going to be let's say search
[Music]
URL and then we're going to need another
one that will be lookup
URL. So we are going to use this search
URL whenever we need to search for
something. Let's say chicken.
So we are just sending a search request
and then if you want to get the details
we are sending a lookup request. So they
both have different endpoints. That's
why we need to create two different URLs
here. This will get the base URL. Let's
say um this will take the search
php question mark s equal to and that's
it. Right? So I am not memorizing these.
Right? I don't know them like top of my
head. Everything is coming from the
documentation. This is for the search
meal by name endpoint. Right. So here
they have Arabia. What does that mean? I
don't know. But looks like it is this
food. Okay, it is this one. And if you
search for something like chicken, this
part would be
updated. So this is exactly what we are
trying to do. And then for the lookup,
this is what they have.
Lookup.php question mark i and equal to.
So let's go
ahead just copy this, paste this in. But
this should be
lookup.php i and equal to. Okay. So I
hope all that makes sense. We'll be
using them just in a second. And then we
can add some event listeners. We'll say
search button dot add event listener
which will be click event and we're
going to call it the search meals
function and then we can add another
more another event listener instead of
clicking when we press enter it should
also search right so I'll say
uh meals sorry search input dot add
event
[Music]
listener let's say key press in this
case we would like to get the event and
we'll just check if this event do key is
equal to enter right I'll say if it is
equal to enter just go ahead search for
the
meal I'll say search meals and we don't
have this function so let's create it
I'll say
function search meals but now since
we'll be using the fetch request since
we'll be using the fetch API This needs
to be let's say async function so that
we can use a weight. Okay. So I'll say
cost let's first grab the search term.
So whatever user types in I'll say
search term we'll say search input do
value and we would like to trim this
down. Let's say value dot trim. Now what
happens if they don't put anything? I'll
just search. They say please enter a
search term. Let's try to handle this
case. I'll say if
um search term is equal to an empty
string or you can say if it is not valid
right if it is a falsy value in this
case we'll say error container.ext text
content will be equal to
please let's type it correctly please
enter a search
term and then we can say error container
doclass list dot remove the hidden class
so that it can be visible and then we
don't want to do anything else from this
function we'll just say return out of it
let's save and take a look at this
actual application that we are building.
I'll say don't put anything and search
for it. Here we go. This is what we got.
And I'll do the same thing with enter
key. I just press enter. This is the UI
that we got. Okay. So this is the edge
case that we just handled. Let's say
handled the edge case. And then now we
would like to actually fetch the data.
So I'll say try and catch block. We'll
try to do something successfully. And if
it fails, it'll hit the catch block
where we can handle the error itself. So
in the try, we would like to first show
some kind of a loading message. So
notice how if I send a request to
chicken, we are going to see something
like loading for a split second. Okay,
so it says searching for chicken. Let's
do it. In the try, I'll say result
heading.ext text content can be equal to
this dynamic value that will be
searching
for let's put the actual search
[Music]
term and then we can even add three dots
at the end and then we can say meals
container inner HTML is going to be
equal to nothing and then we'll say the
error
containerclass list dot add hidden. Now,
since we are just starting to search,
we're going to get rid of the error
container, right? We're going to just
hide it. But if we have some errors,
then we can display it under the catch
block. Okay, now it is time to actually
fetch the meals, right? I'll say fetch
meals from
API. And to be able to fetch something,
we can use the fetch API. We'll say
await
fetch and we'll put our search URL,
right? I'll just say search URL because
we are trying to search for a meal. And
then we'll put the search term. I'll say
search term. And now if you just scroll
to the top a little bit, if you're
wondering what the hell does this even
mean, right? What is what is this equal
to? Now the base URL is this one and
search URL is base URL plus this value.
Right? So if you delete this part and
put the base URL so this is what the
search URL is. I'll copy this and just
do Ctrl C. Okay. So this is the search
URL itself that we have. And then at the
very bottom we have the search term. If
user put something like chicken this
will be equal to chicken. I hope that
makes sense. So this is the URL that we
just put to get the correct value, the
correct details and this will give you a
response right let's say response and
then we can get the data out of it. I'll
say const data again await
response.json then we can let's just say
console log the data itself. Let's
say beta is here. And also we can do
something like if okay I'll just leave
it so that it's not really confusing.
I'll do it in a second. For now let's go
ahead open the
terminal the console and send a request
to
chicken. Okay. So it says this could not
be found. Do I have a typo? Let's see
why this is the case. Um, for some
reason this is what they put in front.
So I just pause the video and debug this
a little bit. Just make sure to add
https and double like double forward
slashes. Now this should be working out.
Let's go ahead to search for chicken.
Okay, so we have this loading state and
then we got the data itself and it is
under an object called meals. So we'll
say data do meals and then we can get
the actual results. So if we search for
something that does not exist, the meals
will be null. And let's handle this with
the if check. So this is what I was
going to add. I'll say
if data do meals is equal to null or we
can say if it is not existed by doing
this. This is the same thing. I'll just
be a bit more explicit and I'll say if
it is equal to null in this case I'd
like to do something right I'll say the
result heading text content for now is
going to be nothing and then we'll say
the meals
container inner html is going to be
equal to nothing as well we're just res
resetting it and then we can say error
container text content can be something
like no recipes
found for this search term and I'll wrap
this with quotes. Let's
say search term itself and then let's
say try
another search
term and then we would like to see this
on the UI that's why we're going to say
error container.class class list remove
the hidden class so that it is visible
on the UI right but in the else case
that means we found something right so
this is the case where
we like where we found no meals I'll say
no
meals
found but here we found something we'd
like to update the UI okay so I'll just
say result heading is going to be equal
to the text content will be equal to
search results. So I just add search
results for the search term and notice
how this should be back tick so that we
can put the actual dynamic value and
then we can display the meals. So I'll
just say to display the meals for a
second but for now let's save and give
it a go. Just test this out. I'll put
something that does not exist. We are
going to hit the if check where the
meals is not found and we're going to
get this UI, right? No recipes found for
this search term. Try another one. Let's
try something else such as chicken. We
got the loading state. And then it says
search results for chicken. But we don't
have the function. So we need to go
ahead and build it right here. So I'll
say call the display meals method with
the data dot meals. So we'll basically
take this meals
object right we have the meals we're
going to send this array so that we can
display all of them one by one and every
single one of them let me demonstrate
this now I'll just refresh for a second
I'll say chicken. So we got data meals
which is an array of 25 items. So every
single one of these objects has the ID
meal right the ID of the meal the name
um let's see we got the instructions so
on and so forth and we'd like to grab
this data nicely display on the
UI okay so let's see how we can make
that work and once we search for it once
we display the results maybe we can get
rid of the search input right I'll just
say once you display them you can say
search input do value is going to be
equal to nothing and then in the catch
case let's handle that one as well where
we can say error container text content
is going to be equal to something like
something went wrong right like anything
can go wrong so we're going to hit the
catch block and we would like to put a
general message and then we would like
to see this on UI so we're going to get
rid of the hidden class. Okay, I hope
all that makes sense. Now we can get
started with this function where we will
display the meals. Okay, so I'll just
scroll to the bottom. I'll say function.
This is our function that we have of the
function name and then we'll get the
meals as the argument. Now I'll say
meals container inner html will be
resetted initially and then we'll go
ahead map through every single meal and
display something for them. So I'll say
meals do for
each we can use this method because it
is an array. We're going to get every
single meal and return something. So
here I'll say meals container meals
container.inhtml is going to be updated.
So we'll say just concatenate it with
this value. So every single time we will
update this container, right? And what
do we want to add? So we'll say we'd
like to have a div. Now you need to be
really careful and type this out
correctly. So we'll open this up and
then turn this off.
Now if you don't want to type this out
once again I have prepared the GitHub
gist. I'll copy this entire thing paste
it and I'll walk you through it. So we
are basically looping through meals and
creating a card for every single one of
them. So we got the meal and we will put
this div for every single one of them
which is this output that you have seen.
So it has the class name of meal and we
added this data meal id. We'll be using
it in a second. And it'll get the ID
meal field. Then we have the image. This
is coming from the API. We got the name
and then the category. Okay. Let's save
and take a look at it. I'll say chicken
search. Okay. So, it is working as
expected already. We got the name, uh
the image, the category, and it is just
working as expected. Now, what happens
if we click to one of them? Currently
nothing happens. But what we want to
happen is this one. We would like to get
the details. But now how do we know we
click to this one or we click to this
one or this one. Right? How does this
happening? Well, it is possible thanks
to this field. We have the data me ID.
So this is the data set that we are
going to add on every single card just
like what we have done at the moment.
And when we click to them, we'll be
using this ID field. I hope that makes
sense. If not, it'll do just in a
second. For now, let's put them side by
side and get started with this
functionality where when we click to
when we click to a cart, we would like
to have this UI updated. So, let's go
ahead and get started with it. So, the
first thing you should notice is that we
have a click event, right? So let's
scroll to the top and add one more event
listener. I'll just say the meals
container dot add event listener of
click event. And then in this case we
would like to run the handle meal
click. Okay. So this is the function
that we are going to create right now.
And then one more thing when we click to
this button what happens? the meal
details is going to removed, right?
It'll be hidden. So, I'd like to add
that one as well. I'll say if back
button is
[Music]
clicked. In this case, we would like to
run this function here. We can say meal
details
doclasses dot add. We would like to add
the hidden class. Okay. Okay. So, this
is something that we'll see just in a
second when we click to the back button.
It'll be hidden. Okay. Now, let's create
this function at the very bottom of this
page. Okay. So, I just created the
function and this page is refreshed. So,
I didn't really change anything in the
code, I promise. This is exactly where
we left. Um, I'll go ahead create this
variable called meal element. And this
will be the closest element that we
clicked. Let's say
e.target dot
closest mail. Let's say dot meal. So
this will give you the meal element that
we clicked. And then we'll say con meal
id. We'll say meal
element get
attribute where we would like to get
this data meal id. So this is the
attribute that we have passed. So we'd
like to get that one. So it'll give you
the value which is the meal ID. Right?
And here I can say if this meal element
does not exist just return out of this
function. Don't do anything. Okay. Now
we have the meal ID. we can do a lookup
right I'll say try and catch we'll be
using the response that is coming from
await fetch of the lookup URL let's put
this let's say lookup URL that we have
created above and then we'll add the me
ID okay so I just added the mail ID but
we have an error if you're using a
weight the function should be marked
with async okay now we'll get the
data out of this response call. I'll say
response.json. Okay. Now we can just
console log the data just to see what
are we getting as the as the
data. I'll open the actual application
that we are building. I'll say search
for chicken and see the output. Okay. So
we got the data is here. This is the
previous console log. If we click to
this one, it says E is not defined.
Okay, this should be event. Let's take
this as the argument and do it once
again. I'll click to this one. Okay, now
this console log is coming from here,
right? It is the line 90 as you can
tell. Now, what do we have? We have an
array with only one item. So, we would
like to select that one specifically.
All right, because this is the one that
we clicked. If you click to this one,
still you would get this one object.
We'll select this and then it has the
like the area category. It has the
instructions and it has all the
ingredients. Now it says the ingredient
one is chicken and here is the measure
1.2 kg and then onion it's going to be
five thin thinly sliced and then
tomatoes two finely chopped so on and so
forth. So it is going in this order but
we don't really want to add any
ingredients that is not existed right if
it is an empty value we don't really we
don't really want to put it here on the
UI let's just demonstrate this pretty
quickly okay so if if a ingredient is
equal to an empty string we don't really
want to see it here on the UI so this is
something that you would like to keep in
mind and this This is exactly what we're
going to be doing in our code. Let's put
them side by side. Right after this
console log, I'll say if data do meals
and if data
[Music]
meals of zero. So we just selected that
object. If this is existed then we would
like to get the mail itself.
I'll say data dot
meals of that object which has all the
all the data that we need. Now I will
create a I'll create an array called
ingredients and this array will take at
most 20 different ingredients because if
you take a look at the console log let's
open this up once again. I'll click to
this one. Okay. So we have at most oops
let's say at most we have 20 different
ingredients that is starting from one
all the way up to 20 and we would like
to get rid of the empty ones. Right? So
this is what we're going to be doing.
I'll say have a for loop that starts
from one and it goes all the way up to
20 included and we'll say just increment
it one by one. Now I'll say if and I'll
paste this in. So we basically say if
string ingredient 7 or six or five
whatever the i is if it is existed and
if it is not equal to an empty string.
So just read this please we say if this
is existed and if it is not equal to an
empty string only then go ahead select
that and in this case we'll say
ingredients.push we'll push an object
with the ingredient itself. let's say
ingredient and this will be
meal okay so we'll basically get the
value itself right I'll copy this thing
and then we're going to put the index
I'll say meal let's say this will be
back and then whatever the index is here
I'll say put the i so it'll be 1 2 3 all
the way up to 20 now I feel like I have
to explain this really slowly if It is
kind of annoying. Please uh feel free to
speed this up. But we're just going to
go ahead put the measure now. So we'll
have the ingredient as well as the
measure itself. Once again, I'll say
meal back and string measure or strr
measure value and whatever the index
is. We're going to select all of them.
And if this is equal to an empty string
or if it is something like null, let's
see. Do we have any that kind of a
value? We don't really have for the
measures itself. It is also an empty
string. So what we can do is just fall
back this with a with an empty string or
we can even leave it empty. Okay. So now
that we got the ingredient and measure,
all we want to do just display them on
UI. Now I'll go ahead right after the
for loop, I'll say mail uh mail details
content.
HTML will be equal to this thing that we
have. Now we'll do the same thing or a
similar thing what we have done above.
We'll just put some content and instead
of typing this out it'll be really
annoying. We would like to copy it from
the GitHub just let me copy and paste
and I'll walk you through it. Okay, I
just paste it. We got the meal itself
which we have copied or which we have
grabbed previously. We are getting the
thumbnail and put it under the image. We
are getting the H2. Put the name of it.
Put the category. If it is empty, we'll
say uncatate uncatategorized. Then we
have the instructions and we are getting
the ingredients array. For every single
one of them, we are putting the measure
and then whatever the ingredient is. So
if you take a look at the end result, we
have the measure first and then the
ingredient name. So we have like five
thinly sliced onion so on and so forth.
And since this will be an array, we
would like to convert this to a string.
We use the dot join method. So pretty
basic JavaScript knowledge that you
should have in mind. Whenever you
whenever you use map, this will be an
array. You would like to take this and
convert it to a string. And then uh we
say if there is a YouTube video, just go
ahead put the link otherwise leave it
empty. Okay. So that's going to be for
the markup. I'll shrink this and I'll
say meal details dot class list. We'll
say remove the hidden class so that we
can see it on the UI. And one more thing
we would like to scroll into view. I'll
say mail
details dot scroll into view. And I'll
just say the behavior is going to be
[Music]
smooth. Okay. Now let's put them side by
side and give it a
go. Okay, let's just even like try it
like this, not side by side. I'll say
search for chicken and click to this
one. Okay, we got the actual details and
we are scrolled into it smoothly. Right,
it is not happening instantly. It is
going smoothly all the way up to the
bottom. We have the image, the
instructions, ingredients, and the link
itself. Let's try to open this up for a
split
second. Okay, so we actually have the UI
or the link I should say and then let's
handle the catch case and that's going
to add for this project I
believe. So we'll say could not load the
recipe details. Try again and now let's
get rid of the hidden class so that we
can see it on the UI. Okay, so let's try
this out for one last time and see if it
is working as expected. So I'll search
for chicken. We got the loading state
and then the title. We got the actual
results. We can click to any of them. We
got the details and we can say back to
recipes. It'll be hidden because we are
adding the hidden class. And then let's
try to search without without putting
anything. Okay. Let's search for
something that does not
exist. Okay. So it looks like everything
is working as expected and this should
be responsive as well. So this is what
we have on large screens, smaller ones
and in the tiny
screens. Okay. So I'd like to get rid of
the console logs that we have. This is
the first
one and this is the second one.
Okay, so with that that's going to be it
for the entire project. I hope you
enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next
one. Okay, so welcome back. In this
section, we're going to build a currency
converter application. This is the end
result. Let's see how that work and
we'll build it from scratch. So we can
put any kind of amount. Let's say 150.
And we will convert US dollars to
something like euros. And all these
currencies are coming from an API, a
free API, a free service that we'll see
just in a second. Okay, let's say
convert. This is the equation that we
have. And we can even double check this
with a different application. So in my
Mac, I have Raycast. So I'll say
$150
to Okay, so this is more or less the
same thing. Maybe this one is using a
different API. That's why there is a
slight difference but basically it is
the same thing and it is working
correctly in real time. Okay, if you
would like to get the screenshots, I'll
leave the link in description. So if you
would like to maybe build it by
yourself, this is the uh let's say the
starter point. Once you convert, this
will be the output. And you have all
kinds of currencies and all of them are
coming from an API. So, you don't really
need to type this out at all. Okay. Now,
let's go and get started with the HTML.
I'll say
index.html
style.css and a JavaScript file plus a
script.js. First, let's get started with
the markup. I'll put them side by
side. And let's say start this with the
live server.
Okay, so I just got a warning as always.
Um, this is something that I'll delete
later in the video once we complete it,
but this will basically update the port.
So if this looks like something that you
didn't get or kind of confusing, just
ignore it completely. It has nothing to
do with this project. Okay. So, I'll say
get
the title as currency
converter
app and let's put a title like H1
pay. Okay, just refresh. Now, it should
be working out in real time. As you
save, it'll be updated. So, the first
thing I'd like to do just link my CSS
file as well as the JavaScript file.
I'll say script source that will be
script.js. JS file and then the other
thing that we would like to do is to
create a container where we would like
to put the H1 and let's actually take a
look at the end result and go over it.
So I'll say it'll take the currency
converter as our title and then right
after this I'll have the form. Let's say
form it'll get the ID of
converter- form. Now we don't really
need any actions. So I'll go ahead and
delete this. We have the ID where we can
get started with the very first form
group element. Okay. So we're going to
have a
label that will be this label amount.
Right? I'll say poor will be for amount
and then content can be amount. Right?
After the label we'll have the input
that is going to be type of number.
Let's put that and give it an ID. Let's
say it'll be amount. and then a
placeholder. Let's see if I refresh.
This is the placeholder that we have. So
I'll say enter
amount. And let's say this will be
required. So if we don't put an amount
and try to convert this, we're going to
get a warning. Okay. Right after this
very first form group, we're going to
have another
one. Let's say group just like this. And
then this will be the select element.
Now here we can see we have a select
with bunch of different options. So
let's say first just get the label
itself. I'll copy this paste that let's
say this will be for from dash
currency and amount could be from. Sorry
the content could be from and then we'll
have the select element. Let's delete
the name. We'll put an ID uh let's say
from
oops from currency. Now the content will
be empty at the moment. So we cannot
really just go ahead and say option and
then add every single option. So we have
I think more than 100. I didn't really
count it. I don't know how much we have.
But we cannot really type this out,
right? Technically we could we could
spend the ne next one hour and put all
of them. But this is not really
something that you should be doing. This
is not really how you build real world
applications, right? This data will be
coming from our API. So let's say
currency options will be
inserted from our API. Okay. So that's
going to be it for the very first one.
I'd like to duplicate this and let's say
this is going to be the form group. This
will be two currency, right? Let's do
the same thing. And then the content can
be two. Okay. Once again the options
will be dis will be displayed and then
finally we can put the result. So once
we put an amount let's say from USD to
this one. Okay. So this will be the
result text. So we would like to put
that um after this select and after this
div. I think I forgot to add the button.
So go right after the form group and
still within the form we'll have the
button. Let's say the type is going to
be submit. And then we can say button.
We'll say
convert. Okay. And then we can go
outside of the form. I'll say let's
create a
result div. And this will take the
content later in the video. Right? Once
we calculate it, it'll be coming from
our API. So that's it for the entire
markup. I'll just go ahead get a uh get
a phone family. And we can do it by
using this extension as we have done
previously. So let's say Google fonts.
You need to install it. I have already
done this. Once you install it, you can
say commandshiftp or control shiftp and
then just search for Google fonts. Now
you can insert it with the link to the
HTML file and you can yeah like you can
select any font family that you wish.
I'll go with popins. Okay. Let's put it
right after the style. CSS import. So
that's going to be for the HTML file.
Now let's get started with the style.css
file. So as always, the first thing you
would like to do is to add your resets.
So I'll say margin of zero, padding of
zero. Just get rid of them. Get rid of
the default margins and paddings. And
also add the box sizing of border box.
Now we'll be using some CSS variables
that I'd like to copy and paste. and
I'll provide them if you don't want to
type them out. So, I have just prepared
a GitHub gist that you can find the link
in description. Go ahead, copy this and
paste it. It should be under the
currency-con converter MD file. So, this
is the exact same value that I have.
Once you have done this, we can get
started with the body element. So, I'll
say body, let's say the background color
will be equal to variable of BG primary.
And then we can get started with the uh
centering right I'll just center
everything in the middle of the screen
I'll say display all of flex justify
content will be centered let's say align
items will be centered as well and we'll
say minimum height could be 100 ph here
we go and then I'll say padding is going
to be 20 pixels from all directions and
then we can update the font family so we
have imported the popins I'll use this
one Just in case if this is not
available, we can say use the default
sans serif for sans serif uh phone
family and then we can get the container
right I think I have a typo let's say
container I'll say width is going to be
100% the max width could be 400
pixels and then we can select the
background color let's say it'll be
variable of bg secondary three and then
we can say padding will be 30 pixels not
auto okay then we can add some border
radiuses to be 15 pixels and then I'll
add some box shadow let's say 0 to 40
pixels 20 pixels and then rgba value
let's say use the black
value.3 okay now I'll select a different
element which is going to be h1 let's
say text align line could be centered
and then we'll say color is going to be
text primary and finally margin bottom
of 20 pixels. Okay. Now we're going to
get the form group itself that will take
the margin bottom of 15 pixels. Okay.
And then we'll get the label element.
Let's say display will be block so that
it is taking the entire line. Right.
It'll be a block element. By default, it
is inline or inline block. What is it? I
don't really remember. Let's just type
this out. What is label
element display
um by default? I think it is inline, but
let's double
check. I'll just search for something
like
inline. Okay, they are in line by
default.
Right after the label of display block,
we'll say margin bottom of five pixels
and then color is going to be text
secondary. Okay. Then we can get the
input element. Let's say input as well
as the
select selector right I'll say width
will be 100%. So it is taking the entire
width. We can give some padding such as
10 pixels. And then I'll say um
background color will be bg input. Then
we can say border will be one pixel
solid let's say border color. Okay. And
if you wanted to update all these values
all you have to do just scroll to the
top and change them and make them
whatever you
wish. Right after the border I'd like to
say border radius is going to be 5
pixels. Font size will be 1 RM and then
update the color to be text primary.
Okay, I'll get the input focus state and
let's duplicate this. Say select
focus. Let's say outline is going to be
none. Border color could be
updated to be let's say accent primary.
And then finally we can give some box
shadow that I'd like to copy and paste
instead of typing this
out. Okay. So this is what we have as
the output. Now we'll go ahead get the
button element so that we can style it.
I'll say button is going to be width of
100%. Then we can say padding is going
to be 12 pixels.
I'll say background color is going to be
accent primary. And then we can say
color will be white. Let's say fff. And
then I'll say border is going to be
none. You can say border radius 5
pixels. Here we go. And I'll add some
font size of 1 RM. Let's say cursor is
going to be pointer. And when we hover
over this, we would like to update the
background. So I can say just transition
will be
0.3 seconds from all directions and I'll
just say e is right and then I'll just
say button select the hover state where
I'd like to say the background color
will be equal to accent
um accent hover and then I also want to
say transform of um sorry transform is
going to be translate of y minus is 3
pixels so that when you hover over this
it is just going up a bit. Okay, maybe I
can go with two
pixels. Okay, then finally we'll just
get the result and I'll say margin top
is going to be let's say margin top will
be 20 pixels text align centered. I'll
say font size is going to be 1.2 to RM
and then color is going to be let's
say text primary. Now even though we
cannot say it, we can test this out.
I'll say something
like 500 USD. And this is the output
that we got. Okay. But for now, it'll be
empty. That's the entire CSS file. Now
we can get started with the JavaScript
file.
So the first thing I'd like to do is to
select all of my elements. Let's get
started with the converter form. So I'll
say con converter form. We'll say
document.getelement by id. And our ID is
converter- form. Let's duplicate it.
This will be from
currency. And let's go ahead update the
variable name. I'll say from
currency. Let's duplicate it. This will
be to currency.
and then we'll get the amount
input and then we'll get the result
diff. Now let's update the values
itself. I'll say this is the two
currency and then this will be the
amount and then finally this is going to
be
result. Okay, we'll go ahead and add an
event listener. So the first thing we
would like to do whenever we visit this
page whenever it's been reloaded we
would like to select all these options.
Currently we don't have anything but
here we would like to have all of them.
And for this we'll be using an API. This
will be a free API. And if you don't
know what an API is I can pretty quickly
explain it even though we have done this
in the previous projects but I'd like to
go over it once again. Now it sounds
complicated such as now first this
stands for application programming
interface but basically an API lets two
programs talk to each other and this is
exactly what we have. We want our
application to talk with a different
service so that it can get some data. So
it allows you to get or send data
between your application and another
service. I hope that makes sense. So
this is how we can explain it in simple
terms. Okay. So we would like to
whenever we load this page, we want to
send a request to get the data where we
have all these options, right? Let's see
how we can make that work. I'll put them
side by
side. Okay. I'll say window.adde
eventlister. Whenever we load our page,
we would like to say fetch
currencies. And this is a function that
we are going to create. I'll say create
this function for now. Let's leave it
empty. And then I'd like to add one more
event listener. I'll say converter form
where we would like to listen for the
submit event. Once this is happening, we
would like to convert the currency. I'll
say
convert currency. And this is a function
that we will create here at the bottom.
I'll say
function and leave it empty for now.
First, let's get started with this one.
So, the API that we're going to use will
be this one. So, I'll just leave it as a
comment. You can type this out. I'll
copy this and paste it right here in my
uh in my URL bar. Right. Okay. So we are
just sending a request to the latest
version and our base currency is USD and
it'll give you all the rates in real
time. Okay. So here uh this is today's
date. It has been just updated and we
have all kinds of
currencies. So it is like1 US is equal
to1 AED so on and so forth. It is equal
to 138
Canadian and all the currencies. Now we
would like to select all of them and
display it in our UI. Okay. So I'll just
leave it open and let's see how we can
make that work. I'll copy this value.
I'll say const response. When we send a
request with the fetch API to this URL
to this endpoint, we'll get a response.
And to be able to use a wait, we would
like to mark this async. And then we'll
say const data await
response.json. So if you have ever
worked with fetch, this is how you would
use it. First you would get the data and
then grab the uh like you would get the
response and grab the data out of it. So
this is how we can extract it and then
we'll say const currency
options. Now before we do so I I'd like
to just say console log data. Okay,
let's see what we're going to get. If
you open up the terminal, you should be
able to get this
data. Okay, so first they say you can up
upgrade this to version six. I think
this is the latest version, but this is
also working. Um, we can use it. And now
under the rates, we have every single
rate that this API providing, right? We
would like to get the keys, right? on
every single rate we would like to get
the key so that we can nicely display
it. Okay, so this is exactly what we're
going to be doing. We'll get every
single key and display it as a currency
option. So I'll say currency options
will be equal to object keys where we
would like to get the keys from data.
rates. So data is the object. We went
into the rates and get the keys. So if
you now say console log the currency
options you will see an array of array
of currencies. So since this is an array
we can use the for each method. I'll say
currency options do for each get every
single currency and do something with it
where we would like to create an option.
So I'll say cost option and specifically
option one I'll tell you why say
document.createelement create element.
Let's create an option element. Then we
can say option one dot value will be
equal to currency. And then we'll say
option one dot text content will be
equal to currency as well. Then finally
we'll append this to UI. So first we
would like to pass this value to the
from element and then we would like to
create the same option for the two
element right for the two select here
I'll say from
currency dot append
child append the option one and then
let's do the exact same thing for option
two
oops let's say duplicated this is going
to be equal to option two option two
value and then append this one. Okay, so
that's kind of it for this entire
function. As you can tell, we got all
these currencies as an option. I think
this does not work because this should
be two
currency. Okay, now we got the exact
same values here on this one. Now that
we have this function is working
properly, we can get started with this
one. So first if you put a value and try
to submit it. Notice how it'll refresh
the page because this is inside a form,
right? This is a form element. So we
would like to just say first get the
event and say
event.prevent default so that it doesn't
really refresh the page. Once we have
done this, we can grab the amount that
user typed in. So if they put 120, we'd
like to grab that. We'll say amount will
be equal to amount input value. This
will be a string because it is coming
from an input. So we can take this and
convert this to be a to convert this to
be a number. Right? I'll say parse float
and we can get this value and then I
would like to get the currency that will
be from. So if they selected this one,
we would like to get this value and then
get the get this value as well. So it is
super easy to build. We'll say const
from currency
value that will be equal
to from currency dot value and then I'll
duplicate this. Let's say two currency
value and do the exact same thing as the
variable name. Now what happens if user
put something like minus 5? We would
like to give some alerts, right? I'll
say if amount is less than zero, we
don't really want to calculate it.
Instead, I'll say alert. And if you
wanted to, you can put it under the
curly braces as well. I'll say alert,
please enter a valid amount. And then we
can return out of this function. We
don't really want to do anything else,
right? So, I'll go ahead put something
like minus 50 and convert this. We got
an alert that it says please enter a
valid amount and then if this is not the
case that means we can actually convert
it. So we'll send a request to our
endpoint which is this one but instead
of typing out as USD we will we will say
something else. So I'll say
fetch make this to be a back tix paste
this in instead of USD we will say
whatever the chrome value is right I'll
say ch from currency value because we
don't really know what user will what
user will select right and then we'll
say get the
response I would like to make this an
async function okay we'll get the data
[Music]
And this should take the await in front.
Okay. Now we can get the rate itself.
Let's say const rate and we'll say data
dot rates just like what we have done
previously. But this time we would like
to get the selected rate. So we'll say
to currency
uh value. This will give you the rate
and we can convert this. I'll say
cost converted amount. We'll say
whatever the amount is multiply this by
rate. So this is how we can calculate
it. Super basic math. And then I'd like
to I'd like to get something. So what is
that? It'll be this two like two
floating numbers, right? If you don't
add it, maybe it'll be longer than this.
But I'd like to get this and just say to
fix to fixed to only two values, right?
Only two floating numbers. And then we
can finally update the result divix
content. Let's say this will be back
text where we'll take the first put the
amount and then the from currency equal
to two currency and then the uh the
currency name. So say amount one
space and then from currency value will
be equal to let's say converted amount
and then whatever the two currency
is. Okay. Now let's save and take a look
at the output. This is what we have
built. I'll say 150 USD to let's say
euros. I'll search for
it and let's say convert. This is the
value that we got. Let's double check.
I'll say
$150 to euros. Okay, more or less it is
the same, right? It is working properly.
Okay, so with that, that's going to be
for the entire application. I hope you
enjoyed it. I'll see you in the next
one. Okay, so in this section, we're
going to build a GitHub user finder.
Now, by default, I put my own name. So
when you refresh the page, it'll go
ahead get my own GitHub profile. But at
the end of this video, I'll show you how
you can put your own name. And then you
can search for anyone. Let's put
something like Brad. It'll go ahead get
this profile with the latest
repositories. Okay. So this is the
application. This is how that work. It
is completely responsive by the way.
Let's go ahead try to shrink the screen.
So everything will be in the column
direction without breaking anything.
And to be able to build this
application, we'll be using the GitHub
API. So there is a free API where you
can fetch uh GitHub profiles. So here's
the entire link
api.github.com/ users/ whatever your
username is. In my case, this is what I
have. You can put your own username and
it should be able to fetch your profile.
Now this only gives you the profile. You
cannot get the repos, right? But they
have this repos URL. If you send a
request, it'll give you the repositories
that you have, right? So this is what
we'll be doing. We'll send one request
to fetch the profile and then and then
another request to fetch the
repositories. So I hope that makes
sense. If not, we'll see it in in action
just in a second. And if you would like
to get the screenshot, maybe you would
like to build it uh without watching the
video here. You can find the link in the
description completely free. So the
first thing I'd like to do is get the uh
let's say font awesome so that we can
use these icons. Okay. So I'll visit
cdnjs.com. Let's search for font awesome
and I'll copy the link. Now let's get
started with the HTML. So I have an
empty folder and three empty files.
Let's get started with the markup.
So, I'll put them side by side and let's
say just have this title as a GitHub
user finder. Let's say I'll put an H1
that says hey for now. Let's say open
this
up. Okay, so we have it. Now, let's link
our CSS file and then put the font
awesome link. And at the very bottom,
just before the body closing tag, I'll
say script source. We'll go ahead uh
link our script.js file. Okay. Now let's
get started with the actual content. So
we'll have the container and I'd like to
just take a look at the end result as we
build it so that I can reference to this
markup as we go. So I'll say container
and then we'll have the header component
the header element which will have the
H1. So the first thing I'd like to have
is this GitHub icon. So I'll say use the
I element. We'll say class of fab
fa-gop. So this is coming from font
awesome as you might know already. And
next to this icon we'll put the text
which is GitHub. Let's say user
finder. And I'll capitalize the age as
well because why
not? Okay. So right after the H1 I'll
put the P
tag where we'll say search for any
GitHub user
profile. Okay. So I'll just put this P
tag right after the header element. We
would like to put the search container.
Let's say create this div. And I'll have
an input element which is this one. And
next to it we'll put a button. So I'll
say input. This will be type of text.
Let's say it'll have the ID of search.
It'll have the placeholder of let's say
enter. So if you delete that, this is
the placeholder that we have. Let's say
enter a GitHub
username. And then right after the
placeholder, I'd like to say something
like autocomplete will be off so that it
doesn't really get annoying with the
auto completions. And then I'd like to
put the button. Let's say ID will be
equal to search dashbt and then the
content will be
search. Okay. Right after the search
container, we'll go ahead and create the
profile container itself. Let's say
profile
dash container. But I think this will be
an id. So let's say this will be a hash
at the beginning. Okay. And then I'd
like to put the class of hidden by
default because if you refresh this when
you first visit this page, it'll be
invisible, right? We'll have a loading
state. Once we fetch the profile then
this profile header will be visible. So
we'll just have the hidden by default
and then we can get the profile header
itself. Let's say
profile dash header class that will have
the image. Let's say source will be
empty for now because we don't really
know the user profile image, right? This
will be updated later in the video. And
then for the alt we can say profile
avatar. And then I'd like to put the ID
which will be avatar. Okay. Right after
the image I'll have a div that will have
the class name of profile dash
info. And within this div we'll have the
h2 that will store the username right
the full name and then the username.
Then we'll have the bio location date so
on and so forth. So let's say H2 will
get the ID of name. The content will be
empty initially. Let's say P id will be
username. Then we'll have another P tag
which will be for the bio. Okay. Right
after this I'll have a div with the
class name of location dash date. So
both the location and date. I'll put a p
tag. Let's say it'll get this icon which
will be for the marker icon, right? For
the location. Let's say class is going
to be
fasa-map dash marker and finally alt.
Okay, right after this I element let me
give a space. Right after this I'll have
a span which will be ID of
[Music]
location and you can leave the content
empty or you can put something like not
specified by default and if user has if
user has location we are going to update
that value with that actual location
right so I'd like to duplicate this p
tag this will get another icon let's say
fa or I'll say fa this will the calendar
this
time calendar alt and then right after
this icon we would like to put this
joint text and then whatever the date is
right so here we'll say joint but this
part is going to be dynamic so for now
I'll leave it empty and I'll say this is
not going to be a location but instead a
joint dash
date okay so that's going to be for the
second p tag as well let's go outside of
this div which the location and date.
I'll have an A. Oops, I think I have
made a mistake. Okay, let's go outside
of this location date. And then I'll put
the A tag with the ID of let's say
profile dash
link and href is going to be empty for
now. We can even delete it because that
href will be added once we fetch the
profile. So this is going to be the ID.
Let's say target is going to be
underscore blank. So that when we click
to it, it'll open up uh sorry it'll open
up with a new tab and then after the
target we can say class name is going to
be button here. I'll say view profile
that's going to be it for the content.
So right after the a tag we're going to
go outside of this div which is like
which is the profile header right. So
just shrink this go outside of it and we
would like to create another one for the
stats. So these are the stats elements
that we have the followers following and
the repositories. But uh let's say we'll
have three different stat. I'll
duplicate this. Let's say stat times
three. The very first one is going to
take this icon. Let's say class name of
fasa- users which is this one. And next
to it we can put a span that will get
the ID of followers and like this
content will be updated but next to it
will have the followers
text. Okay. So we'll do the same thing
for the following and repositories. What
I'd like to do copy this paste this
inside and same for this one but we will
update the icon. Let's say this will be
fasa- user- friends and let's say
following this will be
repositories and then the icon and also
this should be following by the way
let's fix it the ID will be updated and
this ID will be repost let's say and
then icon will be fa uh sorry fasa code
dash branch now if you save you should
be able to see the output we are going
correctly, right? All we have to do just
build the entire markup. Then we'll jump
into jump into the CSS. Okay. So, right
after the stats, let's shrink this.
We'll go outside of it and we'll create
the additional info such such as these
ones,
right? I'll say dot
additional dash info. And I think I have
a typo. Let's say it'll be
additional just like this. So we'll have
three different items. The first one
will be let's say info-
item and we can duplicate this twice.
This will get the ID
of let's say company
container and then we'll create for the
blog container or the website and then
the Twitter container. Right? So now now
I'd like to have an I element. Let's say
class will be
fasa- building which is this one. And
then next to it we can have a span that
will be ID of company. Um here I'll say
not specified by
default and then we would like to build
the rest of it. So I'll get this
ID. Paste this in. This is going to be
blog container. I'll get the content.
Paste this in. The icon will be f a link
and then let's say id. So the id is
going to be blog but this is going to be
a link. So I'll say a element, right?
When we clicked it, it'll take us to
that website whatever that is. And then
we'll say open this up with a new tab.
We'll say target blank. And you can say
something like no website by default. So
I'll do the exact same thing for the
very last one. Let's say it'll be
Twitter
container. And for the content, let's
try to copy this. Paste this in. We'll
update the icon. That will be F A
Twitter. And this should be FAB, by the
way, not FAS. And then we'll still have
the link ID will be Twitter as well.
Target_lank. And let's say no Twitter.
Just like this. Okay. Okay, so let's
save and take a look at the output.
Everything is right here on markup on
HTML, right? So, right after the A
element, go outside of these two divs,
right after the additional info, right?
We'll shrink this and we're going to put
the repos container or let's say repos
section. And then I'll have an H3 that
says latest repositories. Let's go ahead
paste this in. And then I'll have a div
that will be the id of repose dash
container. Let's say class will also be
reposer. And then we can put the actual
div. Now this will be for the loading
for the loading state. I don't really
know if you can see it but for a split
second. Now this is too fast but like
there is a loading there's a loading
state. Let's try to actually see it.
I'll go ahead slow down my internet
connection. So, let's say it'll be slow
4G. I think we should be able to see
it. Maybe let's say
3G. Okay, it's incredibly fast. Let's
try to copy this and try to open this up
in incognito
window and I'll try to do the same
thing.
Okay, it's incredibly fast because it is
coming from the cache. Can we just
disable the cache? Okay, let's say
disable the cache and run this all over
again. Now, this is super slow, but
let's try to see. Okay, here we can see
we have this loading repositories for a
split second. So, we'd like to build
it. Okay, I'll just put this to previous
state.
Okay, so let's put them side by side.
Uh, we'll have this div that will say
the loading repositories. So I just put
this text that says loading repositories
and I put this class. Now I'd like to
add a comment where the repositories
will be inserted here dynamically.
Right? Once we fetch the profile, they
will be like the repositories will also
be fetched and we are going to put it
into here from our JavaScript code.
Okay, so that's going to be for the
repos section as well. Now, right after
this div and these three. Okay, so just
go outside. So right after these three
divs, which is going to be basically the
profile container, just shrink that. And
outside of it, we would like to put the
error container. So if we have an error,
let's try to put a user profile that
does not exist. I hope this doesn't
really exist. Let's search for it. Okay,
so we're going to put this error
container. By default it would be hidden
but once we hit the error case we are
going to display it which says no user
found please try another username. Okay
so with that that's going to be for the
entire markup. This is what we have. We
would like to now we jump into the CSS
file and get started with it. So the
first thing we would like to do as
always it'll be our basic resets. Let's
say padding will be preseted. Same for
the margin and then box sizing will be
equal to border box. Now I'd like to add
some CSS variables and instead of typing
them out I have prepared an entire list
that you can find the link in the
description find the GitHub finder MD
and then copy this root object. Just go
ahead paste this in. So we have bunch of
different values so that we can use them
to get this beautiful purple theme.
Okay. Now I'd like to select the body
element. Let's say background color will
be updated to BG dark. We would like to
update the color as well. That will be
text light. And since we are using a CSS
variable, we have to wrap them with this
variable uh function. Right? And then
I'd like to say display will be flex.
And then we would like to say justify
content will be centered. Align items
will be centered. And let's make the
minimum height to be 100 ph. So that our
entire content is centered in the middle
of the screen. And then I'll get the
padding to be 30 pixels to 15 pixels.
And then we can save. Let's take a look
at the output as we go. Then I'd like to
finally add the font family to be sense
serif. And maybe we can even update the
line height to be 1.6 so that everything
is just a bit more spaced out. Now we
can get the container itself and just
give it a maximum width. So I'll say the
container will be selected. width will
be 100% but the maximum width is going
to be not height but let's say width is
going to be 800 pixels okay and then we
can get the header element let's select
it I'll say header will be selected we
can say text align will be centered and
then margin bottom will be 30 pixels
okay then we can get the H1 let's say
font size will be equal to
22mm and then margin bottom will be 10
pixels
Finally, update the color to be primary
color. Okay, then we can get the header
of uh I was going to say get the P tag
in the header and then I'll say color
will be text gray and let's say font
size can be one area and then I'll get
the search
container which is a
class. Let's get this one. I'll say
display will be flex margin bottom of 30
pixels and then gap of 10 pixels. Here
we go. And I'll say let's select the
input but specifically the type of text.
So we'll say type is equal to text. We
would like to select this input and just
say flex will be one so that it is
taking the entire space. Heading will be
12 pixels to 16 pixels. Let's say font
size will be 1 RM. And then we can
update the border radius
value. Let's see what is
this. If you scroll to the top, it is
equal to 10
pixels. Okay. I'll say border will be
none like this. And I'll say background
color could be the card bg value that we
have. And then we can get the color of
text light. Finally, outline will be
none as well. Then I'd like to get the
focus state. So if we click to it once
it is focused we would like to get this
kind of like a box shadow value and I'll
just paste this in. We'll say on the
focus state go ahead update this box
shadow. Okay. And then we can get the
button itself and try to update it. I'll
say background color is going to be
primary color that we
have and then we can get the color let's
go with black and then we can select the
border that will be equal to none let's
say border radius will be
updated padding could be 0 to 20 pixels
then we can add like font size of 1 rm
font weight could be let's say 600 it
and then I'll get the cursor to be
pointer and finally we can give the
transition. We'll say background
color and 0.3 seconds. So when we hover
over it we would like to update the
background color to be this primary
color that we have and then right after
the button we can select the profile
dash container which is going to be the
ID. We'll say background color get this
car card bg um I'll get the border
radius let's say variable of this value
padding let's say 25 pixels from all
directions add some box
shadow which is going to be shadow
medium and then margin bottom of 20
pixels and then we can get the profile
header class I'll say display will be
flex align and items will be flex start
and then gap of 25
pixels margin bottom 25 pixels as well.
Now this align items of flex start will
make them to be um align in the start
right it's pretty self-explanatory but
if you were to put them side by side
right this is how they start uh at the
at the beginning if this was something
like centered then image would be in
between so it would be in the middle of
that container let's actually try to see
if I say this is going to be
center it should be updated okay Okay.
So here we can see it is now centered.
But I think this looks a lot more
cleaner. Um just like what we have right
here. Okay. So this is something that I
wanted to mention. Right after this one,
we can get the avatar itself. And we'll
say width is going to be 90 pixels. Same
for the
height. And then we would like to let's
fix this. We would like to say border
radius will be 50%, so that it is a like
um it is a circle. Let's say object fit
will be cover. And then I'd like to
update the border value to be 3 pixels
to solid and primary color that we have.
Okay. Then we'll get the profile info.
Let's say
profile-info is going to be one. So that
it is taking the entire space that is
remaining. And then we can get the name
element. We'll say font size will be
this. And then margin bottom will be
updated. Let's do the same thing for the
username. So currently we cannot see
those but they will be added once we get
into the JavaScript um JavaScript
section. And then let's select the bio.
These are super simple styles. That's
why I'd like to copy and paste instead
of typing them out. We have the bio
where we have this color as well as the
margin bottom. Let's do the same thing
for the location date. We'll say display
flex and let's save. Now they are side
by side. Um the location as well as the
date. We have some gap margin bottom
color has been updated and then the font
size. Now we can get the location date
icons and we can say color will be the
primary color that we have. Now it's
been updated and we can say margin right
could be something like five pixels. And
then we can get the btn class and try to
update it. I'll say display will be
inline block. And then I'll add some
paddings. Let's say something like 6
pixels to 16 pixels. Sorry, 8 pixels to
16 pixels. I'll say background color
will be updated to be primary color. And
then we can update the color itself.
Let's go ahead say color will be black.
And then I'd like to just copy the rest
of it. We will update the text
decoration, border radius, font weight,
font size, and then the transition
because when we when we hover over it,
we would like to update the background
color to be this value. And I think this
should be equal to background color.
Okay, so this is the output that we have
at the moment. The next thing that I'd
like to do is to update my stats. So
here I'll put my comment and then the
stats so that they are side by side
where we set display of flex gap of 15
pixels and just space between. Now we
can select every single stat. I'll just
put them one by one. Now these have been
updated but I think we are missing the
stat on this class or on this element.
Let's visit the
index.html under the
stats. Um where do we where do we have
it?
Okay, we have
stat. Okay, so I think I have double
stats right here. Let's try to delete
them. And this should also be
deleted. Okay, so we have one stats
parent and then one stat, second, and
then the third one. Now they all have
been updated. So right after the stat,
we can get the icon, update the color as
well as the margin. Right. So this is
what we have at the
moment. Okay. Then we can get the error
container and try to update the
background color as well as the color
itself so that we can get this output.
And then I'd like to add this hidden
utility class. Let's say display will be
none. So that that is not really visible
on the screen. So if you save now they
should be invisible, right? Because we
have added this hidden class by default.
And then we can get the additional info.
Let's select this
[Music]
class. Additional dash info. Let's say
margin top will be 25 pixels. Let's say
display will be grid. And then we'll say
grid template columns is going to be
repeat of auto-ash fill. And then I
think I have an extra brackets. Let's
delete them. autofill of let's say
minmax of 20 pixels to one fraction and
then we can get the gap of 15 pixels.
Then we'll give the border top let's
type this out. Border top will be one
pixel solid and let's use this value.
I'll say
255 couple of times and we'll just get
this value. So even though we cannot see
it on on the screen but basically this
is the place that we are trying to build
the additional info right we have added
this border top and let's say the
petting top is going to be equal to 20
pixels okay now we can get the info item
I'd like to copy and paste because it is
such a simple style we have display flex
align items of centered we have some gap
color has been updated as well as the
font size itself. Now we would like to
select the icon and try to update the
color. So I'll say info item I color
width and text would be centered. Now
let's get the link itself. So I'd like
to copy and paste. Here we go. So that
they can look like this. And on hover
state, so if I hover over the link, we
would like to update the text decoration
as well as the color itself. So I'll add
the hover state just like what I have
just mentioned. Okay. So let's save.
That's the styles that we have. The
other thing we would need is the
repos dash section where we would like
to add some margin top of 30 pixels.
Then we can get the H3. I'll say select
the H3 and update the font size to be
1.2mm. Let's say margin bottom will be
15 pixels. We can add some colors such
as text light and then we can add the
padding bottom to be 10 pixels and then
we can add this border bottom. So
instead of typing this out, I'll go
ahead copy and paste with this value. So
that's going to be for the H3. Now we
can get the repos container itself and
make them to be responsive with the
display grid. Okay. Now let's save. Of
course, we cannot see the output because
we don't really have any UI at the
moment. Uh but yeah, so this is the
output that we are building at the
moment. So these are these are the
styles that we would need. And then
let's say repo dashcart. We would like
to update the background color to be
this value. And then I'd like to update
the border radius with this 10 pixels
that we have. And then we can give some
paddings from all directions. Right?
I'll say padding will be 15 pixels and
then we can say the border itself is
going to be this value that you can type
this out and then I'll add the
transition. Now when you hover over them
they will be translated right so we'll
say add the transition on the transform
as well as on the background color
because the background color is also
getting updated. Now let's add the hover
state where we can say translate Y will
be minus pixels minus 3 pixels so that
it can go up and then the background
color will be updated. Now let's get the
repoint name
itself. So font weight will be updated
margin bottom color text decoration will
be none because it is a link by default.
Then the display will be block so that
it can take the entire width. So since
we are doing the exact same thing over
and over again, we can just speed this
up a little bit. I'll say repo.name on
the hover state. The text decoration
would be updated so that we can have
this underline and then the description
is going to take all these values. We
can get the meta data which is going to
be this container that we have. So we
will say display of flex so that they
are side by side. Add some gap in
between which is 15 pixels. update the
color as well as the font size. Then we
can get each item. So this is one item,
this is one item, so on and so forth.
We'll say repo meta- item and then we
can get the icon and try to update it as
well. Then for the loading um for the
loading container that we had, we can
select it, update the color and add all
these styles. This will basically make
it to take the entire width, right? We
say grid column, it'll start from the
very first one until the last one. So
it'll basically make it to be the entire
width. And if there are no repos, we
would like to add this class. So that
was a lot of copying and pasting. Sorry
if it is kind of like confusing or
annoying, but we haven't done anything
complex. So these are all the styles
that we have written above, right? We
have done this over and over again. So I
just wanted to copy and paste the last
styles. So the very very last thing that
I'll be copying and pasting will be the
responsive styles for the mobile
devices. Okay. So I'll add all of them.
If you don't want to type them out, you
can grab everything from the source
code. Right? Just find the style.css,
CSS. Copy the entire file and paste this
in. And with that, that's going to be
for the style. CSS file. Now we are
going to build the most exciting part,
which is the JavaScript file. Okay. So
the first thing we need is to get our
DOM elements. Now we can type them out,
but we'll have more than 20 elements. So
there is no need to type them out. I
have prepared the entire list that you
can find under the GitHub finder. just
go ahead copy every single one of them
and just paste this in. So we have 20
different elements. Um so so we'll just
use all of them to display the UI nicely
here on this application. Right? Okay.
Now that we have all the elements, we
can add some event listeners. So when we
click to this button, uh we would like
to search or if we press enter, we also
want to search. So let's add both of
those event listeners. So I'll say
search button dot add event listener.
This will be click where we would like
to call the search user function and
let's duplicate it. This time we will
listen for key
press but we would like to add this onto
the search input element. So we'll add
the key press event. Um we would like to
do a quick check. So I'll get the event
and I'll say if event key is equal to
enter right only if it is equal to enter
then we would like to search for the
user I'll say if e key is equal to enter
we would like to just say search the
user okay now we need to create this
function let's go ahead create it this
will be a function search user but now
this will be an async function fun
because we'll be using a weight within
this function and first let's try to get
the value and we would like to check if
it is an empty value or if it is an
actual an actual input right so let's
see what I mean I'll say con username we
would like to say search input do
value and we would like to trim this
down I'll say dot trim call the method
and then we'll say if there is not
username if this is a false value we can
say just return out of this function and
return an alert where we can say please
enter a
username. Now I'll just try to click to
it without typing anything. We got the
alert and if you put an empty space so
just put bunch of different spaces still
we're going to get the exact same um
output. If you don't add the
trim and if you try to add some spaces
it'll try to search. So that's why we're
using the trim uh right here. Okay. So
after this check, we would like to
actually send the request. Now I'll have
the try and catch block. In the catch,
we will get the error and handle it. But
here in the try, we would like to send
the request, right? And let me type out
the entire URL. So it is
api.github and just try to put the https
in front. So it is api.github.com
github.com and then / users slash
whatever the username is. So in this
case I'll put my own but actually this
value will be coming from the input. So
just go ahead copy this and we'll be
using it. I'll say const response. We
would like to say await fetch where we
would like to send a get request to this
endpoint. I'll make it to be back tix
and then here instead of my username
this will be coming from the search
input. So I'll say this will be equal to
the username value that we have right
whatever user has. And just before we
send the request I'd like to just reset
the UI. So I'll say profile container
dot class list dot add. We would like to
hide this. So I'll say add the hidden
class and then same for the error
container. This will basically reset the
UI whenever you send a request and then
in a bit will make it to be visible. So
we got the response. Now let's say if it
is not okay, I'll say if response is not
okay, we can just throw a new error and
then we can put something like user not
found. We can put anything. I'll just
say user not found. And then after this
if check we can get the user data. Let's
say
[Music]
const and try to format this. Okay. I'll
say const um user data. We'll say await
response.json. Okay. So response.json
and let's try to say console log user
data is here and try to put this next to
it. I'll save and take a look at
it. I'll try to search for my name. I'll
say put my username and search for it.
Okay, user data is right here. We just
got this data. We have all these fields
that we can display and then we'll be
using the repos URL to be able to fetch
the repositories of this user. Right?
Okay. So now that we know we got the
actual data, it is working correctly, we
can go ahead call this function. I'll
say display user data and we'll pass the
user data into this function. In the
catch case, I'll say just show an
error and let's create this function.
It'll be really basic. Let's say show
error. Um this will not take any
arguments. I'll just basically say error
container.class list dot remove. We'll
say remove the hidden class so that it
is visible and then go ahead add the
hidden
class onto the profile container so that
we don't really see the profile
container right here. Um for now let's
try to create this function as well.
I'll say function put this
name. We'll take the user
data and for now I'll just leave this
empty. So let's try to put a username
that does not
exist. I'll say I think I need to save
this file as well by the way. Let's try
to search for a user. Okay. User not
found. That means this function is
working correctly. Now we can get
started with the actual function that we
have. So I'll just call this as user
because why not? It is shorter. And
before we get into it once again I'd
like to put my own name right here by
default. So you can put your own as
well. Uh basically just scroll to the
very bottom outside of any functions.
I'll say search input value and you can
put your own username. I'll put mine.
This is my GitHub username and I'll say
go ahead call this search user function.
Now if you save by default this will be
the value uh within the input and it'll
actually call this function. So if you
take a look at the terminal and refresh,
you should be able to see this console
log where it is fetching the user data.
Now we would like to take this user and
try to display it. I'll say
avatar.source. Let's get started with
the image. I'll say it'll be equal to
user avatar URL. So it has to be called
like this because this is how GitHub
returns us, right? Avatar. URL. If you
want to get the bio, you would say bio.
So on and so forth. Okay. Now that we
know this, we can move forward with the
name element. We'll say text content
will be equal to
user.name. Or if this is undefined, we
can put the username. I'll say
user.lo. So this is how GitHub calls it.
For the username, it is under the login
field. I'll say username element.ext
text content will be equal to back text.
I'd like to put the add symbol and then
I'll say
user.lo and then we can put the bio
element. Let's say text content will be
equal to
user.bio. If this is undefined, we can
say no bio available. So that's going to
be for the basic info. Now we can update
the location and date. I'll say location
element.ext text content will be equal
to
user.loation. Let's try to type this
out. But if this is not really
specified, we can say not specified. And
then let's try to put the joint date.
I'll say joint date element.ext content
will be equal to user.created
uh
created_. So this is the field how user
sorry how GitHub stores so created add
but now this date is not really
formatted right it is kind of kind of
like ugly so we would like to make it
look nice so that we can put this like
December one and then the year we are
going to build a function where we can
format it for now I'll just leave this
as a to-do I'll say to-do
format the
date. Okay. So, right after this one, we
can add the stats. Instead of typing
them out, I'll copy and paste four lines
of code. We will update the profile link
which is coming from this field. Same
for the followers following and then the
repos. Now, for the additional info, we
can put this if else statement. I'll say
if user company existed, we can update
that. But else we can say not specified.
So you can either wrap them with curly
braces or if it is a like if it is a
single line you can put them as a
oneliner and then I'll do the same thing
for the user blog if user has it or not.
So I'd like to just paste this value and
let's maximize this entire
screen. Okay. So if user has the blog we
are going to update the text content as
well as the href. Now if it if it starts
with http we'll just use it but if not
we will put that so that it is an actual
link right and then in the else case
we'll leave the href empty and we'll say
no website okay now we can actually
display this because by default it would
be
hidden and then let's do the same thing
for the Twitter username so I'll go
ahead paste this in and by the way all
these fields once again are coming from
GitHub. So they have like Twitter
username, we use the blog, right?
User.blog. As you can tell, this is not
something that I am just making up,
right? All of them are coming from the
actual API. So let's try to use the
display flex as well. And then finally,
we will add
the sorry we will remove the hidden
class so that it is actually visible.
Right? I'll just say show the profile.
Now let's save. And here we go. It'll be
updated. We got all this info by
default. And now, as you can tell, this
is not really formatted. We would like
to fix it. And then we are going to get
the repositories because currently it
just says loading repositories, but we
don't really have that function. So, the
first thing I'd like to do just scroll
to the top and wrap this with the format
date
function and delete this
to-do. Now, let's try to create this
function. I'll go ahead scroll to the
bottom. Uh let's say function is going
to be format date where we would like to
get the date string and try to return
the formatted date. So I'll use new date
pass the date string and I'll say to
local date string first option will be n
/ us and then we can add our options so
I'll say year is going to be
numeric and then I will duplicate this
twice here we would like to select the
month this is going to be short and then
finally uh year sorry the day is going
to be numeric as
[Music]
well. Okay, let's try to save. Now, as
you can tell, it's been updated. So,
here I think our gap is not really
working. Let's try to find it within the
style. CSS file. So, just scroll to the
top and find the profile header. This
should be gap instead of grid area.
Let's say gap is going to be 25 pixels.
Now, we have that gap working properly.
So, that's it for the profile info.
Next, we are going to build the latest
repositories. So, I just killed the CSS
file and here I am in the search user
function. Once we display the user data,
we would like to fetch the repositories.
So, I will call this function that we
will create in a
second. And this will take an argument
which is going to be user data
reposl. Okay. Now let's try to create
this function. I'd like to shrink every
one of those so that it's not really
confusing. And I'll just put it right
here. Let's say function
uh I think I have a typo. Put the name
that will take the repos URL. And let's
try to make this function to be an async
function. Okay. So I'll go within this
function. And the first thing I'd like
to do is just clear the previous repos
and show some kind of loading state.
even though we have it. But if we try to
fetch another profile, we'd like to just
reset the state. So I'll say repos
container.in html is going to be this.
Let's say uh string value where we'll
put a div and be really careful to type
this out. You don't really want to have
any uh any typos here, right? So I'll
say div. We'll take the class. Let's
open up our codes and I'll put the
loading dash repos as the class name and
then we can put the loading repo. I'll
just copy this entire thing. I don't
want to put any typos and I'll put three
dots at the end. Okay, so that's going
to be for the inner HTML. Now we can
create the try and catch block where we
would like to send a request to this
repos URL.
So I'll say response we would like to
send a request to this repos URL and
then I'll put the let's say
data and instead of data let's just
actually call it as repos and I'll say
await
response JSON and then now that we have
now that we fetch the repos we can
display it. So I'll create a function
instead of display user data we'll say
display repos and then we can pass this
as the argument and in the catch we can
handle this. I'll say repos container
dot inner html will be equal to this
value which is the error dossage and
we're going to pass the class. Okay. So
let's try to create this function and
then I think the entire application will
be completed.
So first I'll check for an H case. So
I'll say if
repos let's say if repos.length if it is
equal to zero that means no repos found
right. So I'll say just put the uh inner
html to be this div where it says no
repository is found and then we'll
return out of this function. But if
there are some repos, we can basically
try to display it, right? We'll just put
these cards one by one. Okay. So, first
I'd like to clear the container. I'll
say repos container inner html will be
reseted. And then we can add every
single repository one by one. So I'll
say
repos. Because it'll be an array and
every repo we'll just get them and try
to run this function. So first let's say
const repo
cardart we would like to create a div.
I'll say
document.createelement it's going to be
a div element and then we can add the
class name. So I'll say repo
cardart.class name will be equal to
repo-cart. And then we can uh format the
date. So here we have a date. Once again
we'll be using this function to be able
to format it. I'd like to say const
updated
at and we will call this function where
we'd like to pass the repo.
Updated add field. So this is going to
update that. So this is going to update
that date. And now once again I have
prepared something for you that you can
copy and paste because this is really
annoying to type this out otherwise. Um
here I'll go ahead and just say paste
this in. The only thing that we do is to
update the inner HTML where we add a
link tag uh a p tag a div you know
everything that you have seen here where
we like to basically get the data and
display it. Now I don't really want to
type this out because probably I'll make
some mistakes some typos that's why I
have prepared this where you can copy
and paste uh with me. Okay. So just
after this semicolon we would like to
say
repos.container appentis child into it
right which is going to be the repo
card. Okay so if you scroll to the top
you will see that we have the link we
have the description uh we have the name
language we have the star count force
count and then finally the updated date.
Okay so if we save I think this should
be good to go. I'd like to make this a
little bit larger. And here we go. We
got we got all the repositories. But now
in the end result, we only have six,
right? How does that work that we got 30
in this case? So we can update this.
Basically, it's super easy. We can
scroll to the top. When we send the
fetch
request, okay, it is right here. We can
add a query. So I'll say whatever the
repos URL is, right? Whatever that is,
just go ahead add this per
page and let's say it'll be equal to
something like six. Let's save and take
a look at the output. I think this
should be underscore per
page. Okay, now we got only six values,
right? Six repositories. Let's say make
this to be 10. You would get only 10
different repositories. So this is
something that you can add uh to make
that work. But what happens if you
accidentally break break this so let's
put something random. Now this is not a
correct URL. Let's save. So we got this
error where it says fail to fetch. So
this is something that we have even
handled right under the catch. This is
what is
happening. But let's get rid of this
fetch error. Now it is working
correctly. And I'll put this as six.
Let's refresh. Okay, so we only have six
repositories in this application. Okay,
so believe it or not, this is the entire
application that we have built. It's
completely responsive. You can search
for anything, right? Let's just put
Brad. This is what we got. You can
search for John. You'll just get bunch
of different user profiles. And by
default, you can put your
own. Okay, so that's going to be it for
this entire project. I hope you enjoyed
it. I'll see you in the next one. Okay,
so in this section, we're going to build
a custom 404 page. There is no
JavaScript at all. This is only HTML and
CSS. Now, this is actually not about the
project itself, but it's about a website
that I'd like to mention. So, how do you
find these kind of beautiful uh
illustrations? So there's a free website
called storieset.com
uh which is something that I'm using for
my personal projects and even some of my
tutorials. So you can search for
something like not found or even 404. I
think I searched for 404 previously to
be able to get this image which is this
one. So you can use any of them. This is
the one that I'll be using with. And if
you want to change the color, all you
have to do just go ahead visit here. And
you can even put your own color as well.
Okay. So I'll just refresh and get this
default image. Now I I already have
installed it. So I would like to copy
and paste from my file. Okay. So it is
this image. Once you have installed it,
just put it under the um under this
folder. We will not have any JavaScript.
I'd like to delete that file. and let's
get started with the UI. Okay, let's say
this is our custom 404 page. Let's try
to link our CSS file which is this one.
And then we can get started with the
markup. That will be really really
simple. So let's put them side by
side. Okay. So I'll just put them side
by side. Here we can see we have an
image then H1 P tag and then a link. So,
let's try to type this out. I'll have
the image which is going to be the
404.png. Let's add an alt like 404
illustration. I think I have a typo, but
let's say
illustration. And then we'll have the
H1. Let's say
oops, page not found. And I'd like to
add this emoji just to make it a little
bit more fun.
[Music]
and then I'll put the P tag. Let's try
to copy and paste this value. And then
finally, we'll have a link. Now, this
will not take us to any other pages
because we don't really have it. I'll
leave the href empty. And let's say back
to
home. Okay. So, that's going to be for
the markup. Let's say open this up with
the live
server. Okay. Now let's try to add the
CSS
file. So I will get the base styles.
Let's say margin of zero and then the
padding of zero as well. Box sizing will
be border box. Then we can get the body
element. Let's say the background color
will be 1 one one. So it is kind of like
a dark color. So it's not completely
black like 0 0 but it's a little bit
different. And then we'll get the color.
Let's say it'll be white. Then we can
say display will be flex. But now
everything should be side by side. Let's
see. So everything is side by side. But
we want them to be in the vertical
direction. So I'll say flight direction
is going to be column. And then we can
say justify content will be centered.
Same for the align items. height could
be let's say height will be 100
[Music]
VH okay so I just said height is going
to be 100 VH and phone family could be
sense serif then let's select the image
and try to update the width to be 100%
and then the maximum width could be 550
pixels okay so now it's looking a lot
more cleaner right I'll say margin
bottom will be 1.5
5mm and then we can get the H1 let's say
font size will be 2M and then margin
bottom could be one RM just like this
and then I'll get the P tag let's say
font size is going to be updated the
color could be this gray color and then
finally the margin bottom let's say 2 RM
let's update the
length So I'll say background color is
going to be this green value which is #3
ec
f8e and then we can update the color
itself. Then let's say text decoration
is going to be none. Let's save. It's
been updated. Let's try to add some
paddings. Let's say
0.75mm to double it. Okay. Let's say
border radius will be 8 pixels. Font
weight could be
bold. And let's try to add some
transition on the background
color. I'll say 0.3 seconds. Let's say a
on the hover state. We can update it. So
I'll say background color will be equal
to this value which is 04. Let's say
FC8D. Okay. Now let's save. This is what
we have. We can make this a little bit
more
responsive. Let's put them side by side.
I'll add a media query. Let's say media
max- width is going to be 600
pixels. So below uh 600 pixels and below
we would like to implement these styles.
Let's say max width could be 400 pixels
on the image. H1 could
be font size of 1.5 RM and then the P
tag could be font size of 0.9
RM. Okay. So once we hit 600 pixels the
UI will be
updated. Okay. So with that that's going
to for this project as well where we
have learned about this website called
story set. so that you can get free
illustrations with a different bunch of
different options. Okay, so I hope you
enjoyed it. I'll see you in next one.
Okay, so in this section, let's build
this newsletter signup UI, which is
something really really popular and
common. I'm sure you have seen one of
those where you put your email and
submit it. Then weekly you would get
some tips or whatever the content is,
right? And you can find the diagrams in
the description. So for these icons, I
would like to use the font awesome. So
I'll head over to CDNJS and search for
font awesome and then get the very first
link and then we'll get started with the
UI. So I have an empty folder with two
different files which is the HTML as
well as the
style.css. This does not contain any
JavaScript at all. Okay, so let's try to
put them side by side.
This is the end result and this is the
one that we're going to be building
now. Okay. So, let's just say
H1 save. We got the output. So, let's
say
newsletter app or you know let's say UI
and then I'll put the link of my
style.css file as well as the font
awesome link that I have just copied.
Okay. So before we build the CSS file,
let's first get started with the markup.
So here the first thing we'd like to do
is the signup container, right? We'd
like to create this one. And then I will
create the icon container as well, which
is going to take the icon of envelope.
So I'll say f a r fa envelope dash open.
It is that icon that we have. And then
I'll put the H2. This is going to be the
content I'd like to copy and paste. And
then let's get the P tag as well, which
is the description. Okay. Then right
after this signup container, sorry,
within this container, we will create a
form. We don't really need any actions.
So let's delete it. Within this form, we
can create the div element.
class will be
input dash group and then within this
div we can create this icon let's say
class name is going to be f a r f a-
envelope but not open and then next to
it we can put an input that is a type of
email okay we don't really need a name
or ID so let's try to delete them let's
say this will be required and then the
placeholder could be enter your email.
Okay, so that's going to fit for this
div. And then right after this, we'll
add a button which is going to say
subscribe and we can put the icon. So
I'll say put the I element
fasa dash arrow dash right. So that's
the content. Right after the form, we
can put the benefits. So we'll say dot
benefits and then we'll put two
different p tags. Let's say they will
take the class name of benefit dash
item. And then as content it'll take the
I element fasa dash check. Right next to
it we can put this text that says weekly
coding tips. And let's try to replace
this. and I'll say fa check but the
content is going to be this one. Okay,
so I just copied and pasted. Here we go.
This is the output that we have at the
moment. Now let's jump into the CSS file
and get started with it. So as always I
will add my reset at the very top and
then I would like to get my CSS
variables. So for this once again I have
prepared the GitHub chest under the
newsletter signup.mmd. So go ahead get
these
colors. we'll be using them. So now we
can select the body element. Let's say
body where we would like to update
couple of different things. So I'll say
font family will be sense serif. The
background color could be the bg color
that we have and then height 100 phis
will be flex justify content will be
centered. Align item centered and then
finally the color is going to be text
primary. Okay. Now we can get the signup
container where we would like to say
background color will be updated to be
equal to container dashbg and then we'll
give some paddings from all directions
let's say
2.5mm and then let's say border radius
could be 16 pixels or you can just say
1m and then we can say box shadow will
be updated so I'd like to provide this 0
to 10 pix pixels 30 pixels and then the
shadow color that we have and then I'll
say text align would be centered let's
save this is the output let's say
maximum width is going to be 400 pixels
and the width is going to be 90%.
Okay, then we can say border will be one
pixel solid and then the border color.
Then we can get started with the icon
container
[Music]
itself. I'll say margin bottom will be
1.5 RM. So that is just pushed the
content is pushed down. We'll say font
size will be 2.5 RM. And then the color
is going to be primary color that we
have. So I'll say primary color. Go
ahead get that value. Let's update the
H2 that will be margin bottom of
0.75 RM. We can give the color that will
be text primary. And then and then we'll
update the font weight as well as the
font size. Let's get the P tag itself.
Let's say font size is going to be
0.95 RM and then we can get the color
that will be text
secondary. Let's say line height will be
1.5. So it is a little bit more spaced
out. Margin bottom could be updated as
[Music]
well to be let's say 1.5 RM and then we
can get the input group itself. say get
this
class. So first I'll say margin bottom
will be 1.5 RM or let's go with 1 RM
itself. And then I'd like to say
position will be relative because I will
position this icon absolutely within
this input group. Okay. So I'll say
input group get the icon. Let's say
position will be equal to
absolute. Let's say from the left it'll
be 12 pixels. From the top we'll say
50%. And to be able to center this
correctly we'll say transform translate
y of minus 50%. And let's update the
color to be text
secondary. Okay. Now it's been updated
but we would like to take the input and
just say width is going to be 100%. So
it is taking the entire space just like
this. And we'll give a bit of petting.
We'll say petting will be 0.8. 85 RM
from all
directions but we will update the very
last one which is the left we'll say 2.5
RM okay then we can get the background
color and update it to be input BG and
then get rid of the border or even
update it I'll say one pixel solid and
get the border color itself and then I'd
like to update the color that will be
text primary and then font size to be 1
RM and let's give the
transition on everything 0.3 seconds and
ease and then we can get the focus
state. So I'll say input once it is
focused we would like to update
something which will be the let's say
outline is going to be none the border
color could be
updated let's say it'll be primary color
and then I'll say box shadow instead of
typing this out I'll just provide okay
it'll be equal to this value so that
when you focus like this is how that
would look like and I think I forgot to
add some border radiuses so I'll The
border radius will be 8 pixels so that
it is looking a lot more cleaner. And
then how do you update the placeholder
itself? So you can say input and get the
placeholder element. Let's update the
color. I'll say text secondary and
opacity could be
0.7. Okay. So here we can see it's been
updated. So if you say red, this will be
the output. Okay. Now let's select the
button itself. I'll say get the button
where we can say the width is going to
be 100%, it is taking the entire space.
And then I'll say padding will be 0 uh
let's say 85 RM. And then we can give
the background color to be primary
one. It's been updated. Let's say color
could be black. And then we can say font
size of 1 RM. Font
weight 500. I'll say no borders at
all. Um let's say border radius to be 8
pixels. Cursor could be updated to be a
pointer. And then let's say display of
flex so that these are side by side. But
we also want to give some spacing. So
let me save. Okay. I'll say justify
content will be centered. And then let's
say align item
centered. And then finally, let's say
gap of something like 10
pixels or maybe eight
pixels. Okay, I think it's a subtle
change, but it is looking a lot more
cleaner. Then I'll say add the
transition on background color with 0.3
seconds. And let's use the ease
function. And then on hover state on the
button, you can say background color
will be updated. You can use any of
these. Um, I'll just use this one. Let's
see. Okay. So, it it is the exact same
color. So, instead, let's use something
like a66
AEN9. Okay. So, this is kind of like the
dark color. If you wanted to, you can
create this as a let's say as a CSS
variable, but I'll just leave it as
hard-coded value. And then we can say
transform will be translate of Y minus 2
pixels. So when you hover over that
it'll just go up and let's say this will
be added on
everything. Now this is happening
smoothly. Now I will select this icon
within the button. So I'll say button
get the I element. I'll say font size is
going to be 0.9 RM. And let's say the
transition will be on
transform 0.3 seconds in ease because
when we hover over that let's say button
once button is hovered we will take the
i element and we'll say transform
translate x of 3 pixels. So when you
hover over this this icon will be pushed
to the right by 3 pixels and then we can
get the benefits.
Let's say margin top could be 1.5
RM. And then we can say text align is
going to be equal to left so that they
are pushed to the left. I'll say border
top is going to be updated. Let's say
it'll be one pixel solid. The border
color itself. Here we go. Then we can
say padding top could be 1.5 RM. Then we
can get the benefit item itself.
I'll say display all of flags items
centered gap of 8
pixels and I'll say margin bottom of 0.5
RM. Let's update the font size itself to
be 0.9 RM. Okay. So this is the output.
Now we can update the color on these
icons. I'll say benefit item. get the I
element say color will be equal to
variable of secondary color and font
size can be 0.8 8 RM. Okay. Finally,
I'll just add a media query. Let's say
media max
width 500 pixels and below we can update
the signup containers heading values. So
I'll say 2 RM to 1.5 RM. Okay, let's try
to hit that break
point. So we are at 500 pixels. It is a
subtle change, but I think it is looking
a lot more cleaner. Okay, so that was
the entire project and the entire video.
Actually, it's been 10 hours and we have
built 16 different projects in total. I
hope you enjoyed every single one of
them. Uh, if so, just let me know in the
comments and I'll see you in the next
video.
