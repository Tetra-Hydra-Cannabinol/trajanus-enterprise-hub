Review this session and identify:
1. Corrections I received from the user
2. Mistakes I made
3. Preferences learned
4. Patterns that worked

Then open CLAUDE.md and append a new section:

## Session Learnings - [TODAY'S DATE]

Format each learning as:
- CORRECTION: [what was wrong] -> [correct approach]
- PREFERENCE: [user preference discovered]
- PATTERN: [successful pattern to repeat]

Skip any duplicates that already exist in CLAUDE.md. Only add new learnings.
