# Website Development - November 24, 2025

## Session Overview

Tonight's session focused on Command Center interface refinement rather than trajanus-usa.com website updates. However, the Command Center serves as the internal companion to the public-facing website, so improvements here support the overall digital presence.

## Command Center as Internal Tool

### Relationship to Public Website

**trajanus-usa.com:**
- Public-facing marketing
- Client-focused messaging
- Service descriptions
- Contact and inquiry forms
- Professional brand presentation

**Command Center:**
- Internal operations hub
- Tool access and automation
- Session management
- Documentation workflow
- Partnership collaboration

**Brand Consistency:**
Both use "Engineered Intelligence™" tagline (established in previous session).

## Interface Simplification

### User Experience Philosophy

**Problem:** Multiple buttons create decision fatigue
- Which button do I click?
- What's the difference between Upload and Update?
- Do I need to do both?

**Solution:** Single action buttons
- One clear purpose per button
- Obvious next step
- No ambiguity

### Applied to Session Management

**Before:**
```
Complete Session Update
Upload Files
Update MASTERs
Claude AI Home
```

**After:**
```
Update Living Documents
Claude AI Home
```

**Benefit:** User knows exactly what to do. One button for documentation automation.

### Traffic Study Focus

Command Center provides Tom access to:

This sets expectations for quality and organization.
