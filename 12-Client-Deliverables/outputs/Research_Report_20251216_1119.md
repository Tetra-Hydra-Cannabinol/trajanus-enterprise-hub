**Published:** Unknown date  

> How Anthropic’s new Model Context Protocol specification transformed everything we thought we knew about MCP servers. Perhaps the most exciting addition is **elicitation capability** — the ability for MCP tools to engage in multi-round conversations with users when information is missing or ambiguous. With universal OAuth 2.1 compatibility, MCP servers can now be deployed in any environment with any identity provider. Resource linking creates a foundation for building more sophisticated client applications that can intelligently navigate and discover MCP server capabilities. The structured output requirements and enhanced security model make MCP servers truly enterprise-ready, with predictable behavior and robust error handling. But the real victory wasn’t achieving perfect compliance — it was discovering how much more **capable and user-friendly** MCP servers become when built to the new specification. Interactive workflows and intelligent error handling transform MCP from a technical tool into an accessible interface that adapts to user needs. * Kafka Schema Registry MCP Server — Our open-source implementation showcasing full MCP 2025–06–18 compliance.

**Published:** Unknown date  

# Analysis of Anthropic MCP 2025H1 Milestones ​. We have been researching agent communication protocols and paying close attention to MCP, and we have also submitted some of our proposals to the community. Today, based on our understanding of MCP, we'll analyze the official milestones and share our thoughts on MCP and agent communication protocols. In the future, MCP will strive to become an industry standard. ### Remote MCP Support ​. In my previous article , I mentioned that MCP's lack of remote data access support is due to a critical flaw - the absence of a comprehensive identity authentication scheme. We can see that the community has recognized this issue, as the first milestone is to support remote MCP connections, with authentication and authorization being the primary focus. Based on this proposal, we have developed a W3C DID-based authentication scheme (https://github.com/agent-network-protocol/AgentNetworkProtocol/blob/main/03-did%3Awba Method Design Specification.md), waiting for the pluggable scheme to be merged before submitting a PR. MCP hopes for community-driven standard development, although the main maintainers are currently Anthropic developers.

**Published:** Unknown date  

Combining Descope for authentication, Supabase for the backend infrastructure, and pgvector for embedding storage and retrieval allows developers to create scalable, high-performance apps prioritizing functionality and security. This code defines a SQL function named `get_relevant_docs` that retrieves relevant documents based on their similarity to a given query embedding. This code imports the `runExtractor` function to generate embeddings for a query and uses Supabase’s `rpc` method to call the database function named `get_relevant_docs` that you created earlier to retrieve documents related to the query. Create a file named `generate_response.js` in the project root folder and add the following code to pass the contextually relevant documents to the OpenAI model and generate a response:. In this blog, you prepared your Supabase database for embedding data, used pgvector to store and retrieve embeddings, and created a database function to retrieve relevant documents.

# Optimizing Vector Search at Scale: Lessons from pgvector & Supabase Performance Tuning. *The hard-won wisdom of running vector search in production — from dimensionality decisions to hardware sizing that actually matters*. This is the operations playbook I wish I’d had when architecting vector search at scale — the lessons learned from production outages, the hardware sizing decisions that saved us six figures, and the index strategies that actually matter when you’re serving millions of queries. Factor in HNSW index overhead (roughly 2–3x the base vector size), and suddenly we needed nearly 1TB of RAM for optimal performance. * **HNSW index**: 2–3x the base vector size. Vector search is surprisingly CPU-intensive, especially during index builds. Our production configuration uses 32-core ARM instances (we saw 15% better price-performance than x86 for vector operations), but the sweet spot varies by workload:. Vector search at scale isn’t just about choosing the right algorithm — it’s about understanding the operational implications of every architectural decision.

# Anthropic’s Computer Use — Why, What and How. Ever dreamed of having an AI that could **literally run your computer for you**? Well, that’s exactly what Anthropic is bringing to the table with their new beta feature: **computer use**. Yep, Claude—their AI—can now handle tasks like running scripts, editing text, and gathering data without you lifting a finger. It’s like your own personal digital assistant, but smarter. And like all beta features, it comes with its quirks, risks, and moments where you might want to pull your hair out. ## What Is Computer Use, Really? Think of it like a remote worker that can **run commands, automate boring stuff**, or even gather data from websites—all while you focus on more important things. 1. You tell Claude what you want done. 2. Claude picks the right tool (like running a script or editing a file). 3. You sit back, and the AI handles it—evaluating results step by step.

We also evaluated the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet for catastrophic risks and found that the ASL-2 Standard, as outlined in our [Responsible Scaling Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/news/announcing-our-updated-responsible-scaling-policy), remains appropriate for this model. [Claude 3.5 Haiku](https://www.anthropic.com/claude/haiku) is the next generation of our fastest model. We’re excited for you to explore [our new models](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/1cd9d098ac3e6467/original/Claude-3-Model-Card-October-Addendum.pdf) and the public beta of computer use—and welcome you to [share your feedback](mailto:feedback@anthropic.com) with us.
