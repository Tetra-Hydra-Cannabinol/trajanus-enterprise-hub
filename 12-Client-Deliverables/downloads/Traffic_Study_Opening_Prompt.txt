Good morning Jake. Traffic Study Toolbox project - first working session.

CONTEXT: Bill King here, Principal/CEO Trajanus USA. This is the Traffic Study Toolbox project for my partner Tom Chlebanowski (PE, JD) who's currently in Kwajalein with Army Corps. He returns soon and will use this workspace.

TODAY'S WORK: Setting up project knowledge base with Grace Fellowship Church traffic study - our template workflow example.

I'm uploading essential traffic study documents from a completed project:
- Complete TIA report example
- SOW proposal template  
- Site plans
- Agency standards (City of Peoria)
- Trip generation calculations
- Turn lane warrants
- Traffic count data

PROTOCOL VERIFICATION:
- Confirm we're in Traffic Study Toolbox project
- Apply all Trajanus protocols and quality standards
- Professional execution only - no quick fixes
- "The way you do one thing is the way you do everything"

NOTE: I have Jake 1.0 running simultaneously in Command Center project. We're testing dual-instance operation while maintaining protocol compliance across both sessions.

Ready to organize these files for Tom's use. Let's make this workspace operational.
