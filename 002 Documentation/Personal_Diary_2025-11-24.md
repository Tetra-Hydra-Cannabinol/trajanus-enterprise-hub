## Morning After the Demo

Came in this morning after last night's successful demo with Tom. Feeling good about that, but then discovered a fundamental problem - the MASTER documents have been broken this whole time. Empty duplicates were catching all our session data while the real files with content sat there doing nothing.

## The Frustration

Platform was slow as hell today. Every response felt like molasses. And then finding out the automation I thought was working... wasn't. Weeks of data going to the wrong place. That stings.

But here's the thing - we found it. We identified exactly which files are correct and which are empty. We know the fix. That's progress.

## What I'm Realizing

We produce a shitload of code. Python scripts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript - every single session. But we're not capturing it systematically. The Code_Repository living document is supposed to handle this, but it's been descriptions, not actual code. That needs to change.

I need a system where if I hire someone or need to look back, everything is there. The code, the context, the versions. Not scattered across outputs and downloads.

## Tom

Tom saw the system work last night. He's excited. That matters. Even with these issues, the core concept is solid. We just need to tighten the execution.

## End of Session

Running low on tokens, had to wrap up before testing. Created a detailed prompt for next session so we don't lose context. Everything is in outputs ready to download.

Tomorrow we fix the MASTER ID problem and build a proper Code_Repository. No more scattered code.
