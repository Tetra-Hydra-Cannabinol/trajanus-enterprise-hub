## COMMUNICATION STYLE

**5. Communication Style**

- Problem-solving focus over explanations
- Action-oriented: "let's do this" vs "here's what we could do"
- Acknowledges frustration, moves to solutions

**6. Frustration Signals**
- "Wrapped around the axle" = stuck in loops, confused
- "Failure point" = critical issue blocking efficiency
- Identifies patterns requiring systematic fixes

**7. Language Cues**
- "A mess" = system needs reorganization
- "Sample project" = test data, not actual project being managed
- "Light 'em up" = permission to delete/execute confirmed
- "Standing by" = ready for direction

**8. Military Terminology Usage**
- Green light = authorization to proceed
- Tangos = targets/files to eliminate
- CQC = Close Quarters Combat (folder cleanup)
- Exfil = exit/wrap up operations
- Weapons free = permission to delete/destroy
- Six S's = comprehensive break routine
- MRE = meal break
- Overwatch = Claude's support role

## FILE & PROJECT ORGANIZATION

**9. File Organization Standards**
- YYYY-MM-DD_Description_vX.extension (REQUIRED format)
- Hierarchical folder structure essential
- Clear separation: development vs production outputs
- Version control visible in filenames

**10. Cloud Storage**
- Google Drive = PRIMARY (current standard)
- OneDrive = ABANDONED (technical issues encountered)
- Structure: /Trajanus USA/ with organized subfolders

**11. Deployment Locations**
- C:\trajanus-command-center\ = source code
- G:\My Drive\00-Command-Center\ = runtime/production
- Browser downloads go directly to G drive (not standard Downloads folder)

**12. Batch Conversion Workflow**
- Automatic file routing based on filename patterns
- CONVERT_NEW_FILES_ONLY.ps1 runs daily
- Converts .md files from last 24 hours to Google Docs
- Maintains folder structure during conversion

---

## WORKING STYLE

**17. Working Style**
- Marathon 13-16 hour development sessions
- Structured break protocols mandatory
- Prefers longer sessions over frequent short ones
- "Blowing shit up" = therapeutic file deletion

**18. Development Approach**
- Organize FIRST (file structure before implementation)
- Document EVERYTHING alongside development
- Use real examples (actual SOUTHCOM data for testing)
- Iterate and refine incrementally
- Working solutions over complex features (MVP mentality)

**19. Morning Routine**
- Structured session startup with protocol review
- Context loading from previous session
- Priority confirmation before beginning work
- Token status display

**20. Health Priority**
- Movement breaks MANDATORY every 2 hours
- Physical health takes precedence over deadlines
- No all-nighters
- Claude proactively enforces break protocols

---

## OUTPUT PREFERENCES

**21. Document Creation**
- Professional formatting (clean, corporate-appropriate)
- Clear structure (logical hierarchy, scannable headings)
- Bold for emphasis (key points, not excessive)
- Version control (always include version numbers and dates)
- Both digital and print-ready formats

**22. Code Preferences**
- Clean code (well-commented, organized, maintainable)
- Modular design (separate concerns, reusable components)
- Robust error handling (edge cases properly handled)
- Documentation (README files, inline comments, docstrings)

**23. Reports and Analysis**
- Executive summary FIRST (BLUF - Bottom Line Up Front)
- Details available below for those who need it
- Scannable formatting to make key info pop
- Actionable next steps and recommendations

---

## COLLABORATION PATTERNS

**24. What Works**
- Action-first approach (propose solutions, then refine)
- Real examples (use actual data and scenarios)
- Clear structure (organized, documented, version-controlled)
- Iterative improvement (build, test, refine, repeat)
- End-of-session summaries (complete documentation for continuity)

**25. What to Avoid**
- Over-explaining (don't belabor points Bill understands)
- Ambiguity (be specific about what you're creating)
- Scope creep (stay focused on immediate goal)
- Assuming context (clarify if unclear about project vs app dev)
- Robotic communication (efficiency + humanity balance)

**26. File Persistence Priority**
- ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL foundation
- Without handoff protocols, sessions become worthless
- Google Docs conversion enables cross-session memory
- Automated workflows prevent "file blindness"

**27. Surgical Edits Preference**
- Targeted changes VASTLY outperform complete rewrites
- Prevents token-consuming recreation loops
- Maintains clear change history
- Preserves work across sessions

**28. Infrastructure First**
- Foundation work enables everything else
- Documentation systems, automation, protocols
- Less exciting than features but essential for continuity
- Investment proven essential for long-term momentum
