# Website Development - November 24, 2025

## Session Focus
No direct website updates this session. Focus was on Command Center internal tooling.

## Command Center Updates (Internal Tool)
The Command Center HTML file received significant updates but this is an internal tool, not the public website.

### UI Changes
- Removed mission timer
- Green 3D buttons replacing old flat style
- File picker functionality for convert buttons
- Cleaner layout

### Functional Changes
- Convert MD to Google Docs button
- Convert MD to Word button
- Terminal feedback improvements

## Website (trajanus-usa.com) Status
No changes to public website this session.

## Future Website Considerations
- Traffic Study page for Tom partnership
- Client portal integrations
- Project dashboard features

## Notes
Website development was deprioritized this session in favor of fixing document control system issues. Will resume website work once automation is stable.
