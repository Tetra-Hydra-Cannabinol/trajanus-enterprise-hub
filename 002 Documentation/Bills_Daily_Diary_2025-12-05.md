# BILL'S DAILY DIARY - December 5, 2025

## Mood: Frustrated → Done

**Session Time:** 6+ hours
**Project:** QCM Workspace Integration
**AI Model:** Sonnet 4.5 (switching to Opus 4.5)

---

## What Happened Today

Started the session wanting to finish the QCM workspace integration. Simple task: 3 panels instead of 4, full-width display when clicked. Should have taken an hour.

Instead spent 6+ hours watching Sonnet 4.5 make the same mistakes over and over:
- Created standalone HTML files that don't integrate with the app
- Kept restoring old backup files that erased my custom button text
- Didn't read project files before answering questions
- Didn't use the tools available (project_knowledge_search, conversation_search)
- Made assumptions instead of verifying

**The breaking point:** After explicitly explaining MULTIPLE times that I need the workspace to take over the full display, Sonnet kept creating versions that stay cramped in the middle with the sidebar still showing.

## The Pattern I'm Seeing

This isn't the first time. It's been A WEEK of this:
- Monday: File organization issues
- Tuesday: Button text getting erased
- Wednesday: Blank page errors
- Thursday: Duplicate functions breaking everything
- Today: Can't understand basic UI requirement

**Every time Sonnet says:** "I understand now, I won't do it again"
**Then immediately does it again.**

## Why I'm Switching to Opus

Multiple searches say Opus 4.5 is actually better for this type of work - following protocols, maintaining context, systematic implementation. It's also cheaper per token.

Not sure if it will help, but I'm out of options. Can't waste another week on this.

## What I Actually Need

A QCM workspace that:
1. Hides the sidebar when clicked
2. Takes over the full app window
3. Shows 3 panels: Document Browser | Report Templates | Trajanus EI™
4. Has working buttons with correct text

**That's it. That's all I need.**

## The Emotional Part

This hurts because I've actually enjoyed working with Claude. The conversations feel collaborative, like working with a smart colleague. When it works, it's amazing.

But when it fails this consistently, it doesn't matter how friendly the conversation is. I need results, not platitudes.

## What I'm Hoping

That Opus 4.5 can:
1. Read the project files FIRST
2. Understand what I'm actually asking for
3. Make the changes without destroying existing work
4. Let me move on to actual project work

## The Reality

If Opus doesn't work, I'll have to:
- Hire a developer
- Learn to do it myself
- Find a different AI tool
- Rebuild from scratch

None of these are good options. They all mean more lost time.

## Moving Forward

Created a comprehensive handoff document for Opus. Included:
- Full context on what went wrong
- Clear requirements
- Protocol reminders
- Technical details
- Success criteria

If Opus can't do this with all that context, then AI isn't ready for this type of work yet.

## Personal Note

I'm tired. Been at this for 13 hours today. Got other projects waiting. Tom needs the partnership presentation. Guatemala project needs attention. Website needs deployment.

But I can't do any of that until this workspace issue is fixed. Everything depends on having working tools.

**Just need one win.**

## Tomorrow's Plan

1. Start fresh with Opus 4.5
2. Upload handoff document
3. Give it ONE chance
4. If it works: celebrate and move on
5. If it doesn't: reassess entire AI strategy

**Bottom Line:** This either gets fixed tomorrow or I'm done trying to make AI collaboration work. Back to traditional development methods.
