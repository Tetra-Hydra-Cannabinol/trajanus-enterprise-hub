# Session Summary - November 24, 2025

## Duration
Morning session, ~2 hours

## Primary Objectives
1. ✅ Fix Command Center UI issues
2. ✅ Discover and document MASTER duplicate problem
3. ✅ Create improvement files for next session
4. ⏳ Test automation (deferred to next session)

## Accomplishments

### Command Center Updates
- Removed mission timer, kept local clock
- Green 3D buttons (4 total)
- File picker on convert buttons

- convert_md_to_docx.py
- MASTER_INDEX_November_2025.md
- SESSION_STARTUP_BRIEF.md
- NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT.md
- All 6 living documents for Nov 24

## Issues Encountered
- Platform slowness
- Console errors from orphaned JS (fixed)
- Test text left in header (fixed)
- File upload issues for Bill

## Next Session Priorities
1. Design Code_Repository structure with actual code
2. Implement change detection
3. Find correct MASTER IDs
4. Test automation end-to-end
5. Delete empty duplicate files

## Handoff Status
All files in outputs ready for download. Comprehensive prompt created for next session continuity.
