## Content

Both keyword search and semantic search have unique strengths. Keyword search uses a ranking algorithm and specific terms to determine how relevant a document is to a search query. Semantic search takes the search query and considers the context.

Hybrid search improves search precision by combining the strengths of semantic search and traditional search. Balancing semantic understanding and honoring exact query terms, hybrid search delivers results that improve the user search experience. [...] Typically, hybrid search combines keyword search and semantic search, utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. Semantic search retrieves results based on the meaning of the text, while full-text search focuses on exact word matches. Hybrid search is vital for conversational queries and those 'what was that called again?' moments where users don't or can't enter precise keywords. [...] ### Components of hybrid search

Hybrid search is the combination of keyword, lexical, or BM25 (a ranking algorithm that determines relevance), and semantic search. Semantic search focuses on what you achieve with the search, while vector search focuses on how you achieve those results, mainly by retrieving data using vector representations.
