The video above explains how to build and use Sub-agents in Claude code.

#### What are subagents?

Subagents are like focused teammates for your IDE.

Each one:

 Has a specific purpose
 Uses a separate context window
 Can be limited to selected tools
 Follows a custom system prompt

It works independently and returns focused results.

Quick start:

1. Open the subagents UI: `/agents`
2. Create a new agent & select its scope
3. Define your agent
4. Save it to use later
