## Content

Write short and useful documents. Cut out everything unnecessary, including out-of-date, incorrect, or redundant information. Also make a habit of continually massaging and improving every doc to suit your changing needs. Docs work best when they are alive but frequently trimmed, like a bonsai tree.

## Update Docs with Code [...] 1. Meaningful names: Good naming allows the code to convey information that would otherwise be relegated to comments or documentation. This includes nameable entities at all levels, from local variables to classes, files, and directories.
2. Inline comments: The primary purpose of inline comments is to provide information that the code itself cannot contain, such as why the code is there.
3. Method and class comments: [...] Take it slow, doc health is a gradual accumulation.
 First delete what you’re certain is wrong, ignore what’s unclear.
 Get your whole team involved. Devote time to quickly scan every doc and make a simple decision: Keep or delete?
 Default to delete or leave behind if migrating. Stragglers can always be recovered.
 Iterate.

## Prefer the Good Over the Perfect
