## Introduction​

Playwright can interact with HTML Input elements such as text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select options, mouse clicks, type characters, keys and shortcuts as well as upload files and focus elements.

## Text input​

Using locator.fill() is the easiest way to fill out the form fields. It focuses the element and triggers an `input` event with the entered text. It works for `<input>`, `<textarea>` and `[contenteditable]` elements.
