# Context Window Management: Strategies for Long-Context AI Agents and Chatbots

Context window management has emerged as a critical challenge for AI engineers building production chatbots and agents. As conversations extend across multiple turns and agents process larger documents, the limitations of context windows directly impact application performance, cost, and user experience. [...] Emerging agent frameworks incorporate native support for stateful context management. Rather than requiring application-level implementation of context handling, frameworks provide built-in mechanisms for memory management, context selection, and state persistence.
