Your agent is ready. Run it with the following command:

```
python3 agent.py python3 agent.py
```

After running, check `utils.py`. You'll see defensive code handling empty lists and null users. Your agent autonomously:

1. Read `utils.py` to understand the code
2. Analyzed the logic and identified edge cases that would crash
3. Edited the file to add proper error handling

This is what makes the Agent SDK different: Claude executes tools directly instead of asking you to implement them.
