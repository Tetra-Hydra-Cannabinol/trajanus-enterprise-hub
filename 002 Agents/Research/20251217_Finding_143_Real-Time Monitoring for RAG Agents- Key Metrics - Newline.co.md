## Content

Metrics for evaluating retrieval and generation quality play a key role in determining how well retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems perform. These metrics focus on important aspects like factual accuracy, answer relevance, retrieval precision, recall, and content alignment. [...] Visualization and analytics tools are essential for enhancing how retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents are monitored and perform. These tools deliver real-time insights into important metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response quality, and overall system behavior, enabling quick identification and resolution of potential issues. [...] Different tools cater to specific aspects of RAG evaluation. RAGAS focuses on pipeline evaluation with metrics like faithfulness and contextual precision ( DeepEval offers over 14 metrics, including tests for summarization and hallucination. Meanwhile, Phoenix supports AI observability, experimentation, and debugging through integrations and runtime monitoring (
