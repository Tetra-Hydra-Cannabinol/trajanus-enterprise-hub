## Content

When implementing debug logs in a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, focus on capturing three core areas: connection/authentication events, request/response handling, and system resource or error tracking. These logs should provide enough detail to diagnose issues without overwhelming developers with noise. Prioritize clarity and actionable insights over volume—every log entry should serve a specific troubleshooting purpose.
