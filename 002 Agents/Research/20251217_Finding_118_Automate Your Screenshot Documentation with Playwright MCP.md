## Content

```
Navigate to the website and fill in the search term for movie. As you interact with each element, add a red CSS border around the element and take a screenshot. 
```

That's it. No complex setup, no scripting required.

## How It Works

The Playwright MCP server:

1. Navigates to your specified website
2. Interacts with elements step by step
3. Adds CSS highlighting to show user interactions
4. Captures screenshots automatically at each step
5. Saves organized files with descriptive names [...] Initial page screenshot - The starting state
 Search element highlighted - Shows where to find the search
 Search input highlighted - Indicates the active input field
 Final search results - The completed user journey

Each screenshot is automatically saved with descriptive filenames, ready to drop into your documentation.

## Perfect Use Cases
