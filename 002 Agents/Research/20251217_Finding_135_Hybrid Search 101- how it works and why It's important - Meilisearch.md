Hybrid search combines two key approaches: semantic search and keyword search. However, semantic search is a broader term for methods that retrieve contextual or semantic meaning, including vector search and neural search. Let's explore the differences between all these search types: [...] Hybrid search is a combination of semantic and keyword searches. The quality of the hybrid search system response highly depends on the embedder used for the semantic search. The better the embedder and the retrieval algorithm applied on the dense vectors, the better the semantical or contextual response of the hybrid search. In addition, the hybrid search uses keyword matching for lexical accuracy.

### What is the difference between keyword search and hybrid search? [...] Hybrid search enhances vector search by incorporating keyword matching for improved accuracy. As a form of semantic search, vector search relies on an embedder to generate dense vectors and retrieval algorithms like ANN and KNN to identify relevant results. By merging these with sparse vector outputs, hybrid search optimizes retrieval using techniques such as RFF.
