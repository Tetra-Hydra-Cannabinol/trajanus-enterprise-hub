As AI agents become more sophisticated, managing their state across conversations and sessions has emerged as one of the most critical challenges in production deployments. Traditional stateless architectures fail when agents need to maintain context across multiple interactions, resume interrupted workflows, or audit their decision-making processes. This is where State Replay becomes essential, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides an elegant solution. [...] In this comprehensive guide, we’ll explore why state management is crucial for AI agents, the problems it solves, and how MCP’s state replay mechanism addresses these challenges.
