Q: Can subagents share context or communicate directly? Subagents maintain isolated contexts by design, preventing direct communication to avoid context pollution. The July 2025 architecture enables indirect communication through the orchestrator using structured message passing protocols. Shared state management systems allow agents to access common data stores while maintaining context independence. Advanced patterns implement pub/sub messaging for agent coordination without direct coupling. [...] Performance benchmarks from production deployments reveal that well-orchestrated subagent teams achieve remarkable efficiency gains. The parallel execution model reduces traditional sequential bottlenecks, with teams reporting 45-minute complex features completed in under 10 minutes. Advanced patterns like the "Domain Specialist Network" leverage up to 10 concurrent agents, each focused on specific architectural layers - from database optimization to API design, security auditing to performance [...] The true power of Claude Code subagents emerges when orchestrating multiple specialists in sophisticated workflow patterns. The Product Trinity pattern, popularized in July 2025, demonstrates how three specialized agents can compress weeks of traditional development into hours of focused execution. This pattern coordinates a Product Manager agent for requirements analysis, a UX Designer agent for interface planning, and an Implementation Specialist for code generation - all operating in
