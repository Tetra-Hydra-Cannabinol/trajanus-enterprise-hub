I had a web application made in React, and we wanted a desktop application for it, so we went ahead with Electron JS and made the desktop application. The application works fine, but now I want to understand how to architect the app so that both applications (web and desktop) work hand in hand. [...] r/electronjs icon

Electron ( is a framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This is the technology behind many popular apps like Slack, Discord and Visual Studio Code. Join for discussions around Electron!

# Correct Architecture for a React based application [...] Currently, I have put multiple checks wherever I didn't want to show any particular component in the desktop app, even the entry point is different for both of them. In future as well, we want to update the UI for the desktop as right now the UI looks quite web-like, as the whole application was designed keeping web in mind. So I want to architect it correctly so that later I don't have issues.

Any resources for this or any help would be appreciated.
