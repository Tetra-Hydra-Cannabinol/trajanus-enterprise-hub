## Content

After reranking, we have far more relevant information. Naturally, this can result in significantly better performance for RAG. It means we maximize relevant information while minimizing noise input into our LLM.

Reranking is one of the simplest methods for dramatically improving recall performance in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) or any other retrieval-based pipeline.
