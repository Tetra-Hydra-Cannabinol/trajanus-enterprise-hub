In this article, I provide a practical guide to setting up Playwright’s MCP Server within Visual Studio Code, integrating GitHub Copilot and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Many existing tutorials assume a fully configured environment or skip critical setup steps—this guide aims to bridge that gap. [...] ```
code-insiders --version 
```

Once successful, you should be able to run:

```
# For VS Code code --add-mcp '{"name":"playwright","command":"npx","args":["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}' 
```

### Step 2: Validate the MCP Server Installation

Once shell command integration is confirmed:

1. In VS Code, navigate to File > Settings
2. Search for MCP
3. Click Edit in settings.json and verify the MCP server configuration has been added

### Step 3: Start the MCP Server and Configure Copilot
