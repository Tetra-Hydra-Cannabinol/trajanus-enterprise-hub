Improved Search Quality: By combining semantic and keyword search, hybrid search can return results that are both relevant in terms of meaning and also include specific keywords.
 Handles Out-of-Domain Data: Keyword search addresses the limitations of semantic search by effectively capturing out-of-domain terms that may not be included in the embedding model’s training data. [...] Information Retrieval can be a little tricky sometimes. Semantic search relies on understanding meaning, but it can struggle with data it hasn’t encountered before. Think of things like specific product codes, newly released product names, or internal company jargon — these out-of-domain terms often aren’t in the model’s training data. That’s where hybrid search comes in. By combining semantic search with traditional keyword search, you can cover more ground and get better results. [...] Hybrid search overcomes these limitations by combining the power of semantic search with traditional keyword search. This approach ensures that searches are both contextually relevant and comprehensive. For example, Google Search utilizes hybrid search, incorporating semantic search alongside its token-based keyword search algorithm to improve search quality.

### How Hybrid Search Works

Hybrid search combines dense and sparse embeddings to achieve the best of both worlds.
