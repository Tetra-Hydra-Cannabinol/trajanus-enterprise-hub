Playwright visual testing is a powerful technique to ensure your web application’s UI remains consistent and bug-free through changes. By automating screenshot comparisons, you can catch CSS bugs, layout breaks, and visual inconsistencies that might slip past regular tests. We covered how Playwright captures screenshots and compares them to baselines, how you can integrate these tests into your development workflow and CI/CD, and even extend the capability with tools like Percy or Applitools [...] In this test, Playwright will navigate to the page and then take a screenshot of the viewport. On the first run, since no baseline exists yet, this command will save the screenshot as a baseline image (more on baselines in a moment). In subsequent runs, it will take a new screenshot and automatically compare it against the saved baseline. [...] Playwright Visual Testing is an automated approach to verify that your web application’s UI looks correct and remains consistent after code changes. In modern web development, how your app looks is just as crucial as how it works. Visual bugs like broken layouts, overlapping elements, or wrong colors can slip through functional tests. This is where Playwright’s visual regression testing capabilities come into play. By using screenshot comparisons, Playwright helps catch unintended UI changes
