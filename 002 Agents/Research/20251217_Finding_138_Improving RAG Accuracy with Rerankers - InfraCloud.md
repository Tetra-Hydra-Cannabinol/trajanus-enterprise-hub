Rerankers are models used to “rerank” retrieved information based on its relevance to a user’s query. After a base retriever model retrieves information from a data source, this information is passed to the reranker model. The reranker then evaluates and prioritizes the most relevant pieces of information according to the user’s query. This process significantly enhances the quality of the Agent’s generated response by ensuring that it utilizes the most pertinent information retrieved in [...] Cross-Encoder: Cross-encoders handle the document and query together, encoding them simultaneously. This method allows for a more integrated and nuanced understanding of their relationship, which can significantly enhance the precision of relevance scoring. The joint encoding process enables the model to directly learn and evaluate the interactions between the query and document, providing a high level of accuracy in reranking. [...] With the increasing advocacy for open source AI technologies, there are numerous reranker models being developed and open-sourced online. For example, platforms like HuggingFace host a growing number of models in various fields of AI. Conversely, some companies have developed proprietary models and offer limited developer access through APIs. Notable companies include Anthropic, OpenAI, and NVIDIA.
