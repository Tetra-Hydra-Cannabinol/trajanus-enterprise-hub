## Known Issues (Need Fixing)

### High Priority
- GitHub repository not yet created (blocks Chris collaboration)
- File picker modal z-index issues (occasional)
- Supabase connection intermittent (error handling needed)

### Medium Priority
- Hard reload sometimes needed after updates
- Console warnings on app launch (non-breaking)
- Living docs conversion requires manual process

### Low Priority
- UI polish on some workspace transitions
- Loading indicators could be smoother
- Documentation could be more comprehensive
