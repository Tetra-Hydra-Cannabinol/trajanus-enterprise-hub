# Developer Tools - Development & Automation

## Purpose
Developer workspace for building automation scripts, testing tools, and platform development. Meta-workspace for building the platform itself.

## File Locations
- dev.html - Main workspace HTML
- dev.css - Workspace styling
- dev.js - Workspace logic

## Function Inventory

### Script Management
- createScript() - New automation script
- testScript() - Run in sandbox
- deployScript() - Make available to users
- scheduleScript() - Automate execution

### Testing Tools
- runPlaywrightTest() - UI validation
- executeUnitTest() - Code testing
- performanceTest() - Speed/load testing

### Platform Development
- buildNewWorkspace() - Create workspace template
- addTauriCommand() - New Rust command
- updateDatabase() - Schema changes

## Data Flow
1. Developer writes script in UI
2. Script validated (syntax check)
3. Tested in isolated environment
4. Deployed to production workspace
5. Scheduled for automation (optional)

## Dependencies
- Playwright MCP (UI testing)
- Tauri (for new commands)
- Supabase (for script storage)
- Node.js (for script execution)

## Current Status
- Basic editor: FUNCTIONAL
- Script library: STARTED
- Playwright integration: PLANNED (TASK-002)
- Sub-agent system: PLANNED (TASK-004)

## Integration Points
- All workspaces (provides development tools)
- Supabase KB (stores automation scripts)
- Google Drive (backup scripts)

## Known Issues
- Script execution security needs review
- Playwright MCP not yet installed

## Next Steps
- Install Playwright MCP (TASK-002)
- Create sub-agent library (TASK-004)
- Build command library (TASK-011)
