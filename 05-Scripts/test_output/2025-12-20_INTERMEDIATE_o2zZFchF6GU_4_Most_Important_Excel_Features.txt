0:00 Excel just turned 40 and to celebrate, I'm sharing the four game-changing skills and hidden
0:06 tips from each decade that still pay off today. Master these and everything else gets easier.
0:12 1993 was the year PivotTables were born. And I've got a tip for you,
0:16 I'll bet you haven't seen before.
0:18 By the way, if you're not already using PivotTables,
0:20 check out this video to get started. Here I have some sales data with
0:24 various attributes we can aggregate it by. It's perfect for a PivotTable.
0:29 So on the Insert tab, we'll insert a PivotTable. Got a sheet ready to
0:34 insert it on, which is 1990s when PivotTables came out. And we'll
0:38 pop it in cell B8. Let's left click and drag the field list over closer.
0:44 Now I want to see the sales by product. I also want to see the percentage of sales by
0:49 product. So I'm going to left click and drag the sales field into the Values area again.
0:54 And this time, right click, Show Values As, Percentage of Grand Total.
1:00 Let's give this a new heading, percent of total. And just like that, I've got
1:05 my sales summarized by product, and I can see the percentage each product is of the total.
1:10 Now, let's say I want to filter the data by country, segment,
1:14 discount band, and manager. The modern way is to insert slicers for these fields. So,
1:19 let's grab those. Click okay. And there's my slicers.
1:24 But you can see they take up a lot of room. So I'm going to press delete and get rid of them. And
1:29 instead we'll add these fields as filters. So I want manager, segment, country, and discount band.
1:38 And you can see the default layout here is to have all the filters stacked on top of one another. But
1:44 if I right click the PivotTable and go into the PivotTable Options on the Layout and Format tab,
1:50 I can choose to display fields in Report Filter Area down then over is the default.
1:55 But instead we can do over then down or we can just change the number of fields per
2:01 column to two. Click okay. And now I have my filters across multiple columns taking
2:08 up less vertical space. And this is great if your PivotTables are also quite wide.
2:13 Can you believe that PivotTables arrived in the '90s and they still do the heavy lifting today?
2:18 2007 saw the introduction of Excel Tables. This was an upgrade to the old Lists feature. Fun fact,
2:25 the keyboard shortcut to insert a table is Ctrl+T, but you can also use the old list shortcut Ctrl+L.
2:32 Another way to insert a table and apply a specific style in one go is via the Home
2:37 tab and then Format as Table. Here we have the gallery with all the built-in styles. You can
2:43 also create your own custom style. I'm going to go with this green style in keeping with my theme.
2:49 It's detected that my data has headers. I'll click okay. And I'm ready to go.
2:54 Tables come with loads of handy built-in features like filter buttons. And we can
2:59 turn on automatic totals. Let me scroll to the bottom and then check the box for Total
3:04 Row. Here we can choose from different types of aggregation. The default is SUM.
3:08 You can see we've got AVERAGE, COUNT, COUNT NUMBERS, and so on.
3:12 But having the total at the bottom is a bit of a pain. Instead, I'll turn it off,
3:16 and we'll go back to the top, and I'll insert a formula up here. I'll use the
3:21 AGGREGATE function, which will allow me to ignore rows that are filtered out.
3:26 So, I want to SUM, we can see that's number 9. Then, I want to ignore hidden
3:32 rows and nested SUBTOTAL and AGGREGATE functions. That's 1.
3:36 And then all I need to do is tell it which range of cells I want to SUM.
3:40 Let's just left click and drag that out of the way so I can select the sales column.
3:44 Notice in the formula instead of the difficult to read cell references,
3:49 we get the table structured reference which is made up of the table name and the column label
3:54 and that's way easier to make sense of. Close parentheses. Press Enter. And there's my total.
4:00 Let's add a label here. And that job's done. And if I filter the data,
4:05 let's remove everything but 2025. You can see my AGGREGATE formula automatically adjusts.
4:12 Now, another way we can filter tables is with slicers. So, with the table selected on the
4:17 Table Design tab, we can insert slicers. Let's say I want a slicer for the category.
4:23 Click okay. Let's color code it in keeping with my theme. And I'm going to give it four
4:29 columns. And that will just allow me to make it a bit wider and pop it up here above my table.
4:36 Let's give it a bit more space. And we'll make it the same width as the
4:40 table. So now I can left click on any of the categories and automatically
4:45 filter my table. Let's remove the filter from the year field.
4:49 And now we get all the data for components, clothing, bikes,
4:54 and accessories. And I can left click and drag to select multiple. All the while, my
4:58 AGGREGATE formula is updating. And these features make them super quick and easy to work with.
5:04 But the most useful feature by far is how they automatically expand to include the new
5:09 data. For example, let's filter the table for bikes so we can see the bottom of the table.
5:15 And then on the very next row below the bottom of the table, I can add in new data for bikes.
5:20 Let's add in data for 2026. We'll make it for bikes and cargo bikes.
5:27 We'll make it 5,000. And you can see the table range has expanded to include that new
5:32 row. My AGGREGATE formula has expanded to automatically include it because it's
5:37 picking up all the data in the sales column, all without me having to lift a finger.
5:43 So you can see formatting your data as a table isn't just about
5:46 fancy formatting. It's data integrity, automatic updates, and instant filters.
5:52 Power Query was first released as an add-in in Excel 2010,
5:55 enabling us to automate the boring and laborious tasks of gathering and
5:59 cleaning messy data. And that meant we could update our reports with one click.
6:04 It's quite common to receive your data in a monthly CSV,
6:07 text, or Excel file. As you can see, I have here. Let's open one. And you can
6:13 see each file contains the revenue data by region for the month. Now these are
6:17 small sample sets but your files are likely to be many columns and thousands of rows.
6:22 With Power Query I can simply point it to this folder and have it gather
6:26 all the data into one table and then next month I can add the new CSV file
6:31 to this same folder and automatically include it. So let me show you how.
6:36 Back in Excel on the Data tab of the ribbon in the Get and Transform Data group you'll
6:41 find the Power Query tools. Now under the Get Data drop-down we have all the data sources we
6:46 can use Power Query to get data from including databases, online sources, Fabric, and so on.
6:53 I want to get data from a file and then from folder. Simply navigate to the folder, click open
7:01 and here we can see a list of the files in that folder and various metadata relating to that file.
7:07 At the bottom, I can combine, load, or transform the data. And under the Combine drop-down,
7:13 we can combine and transform the data. Go straight to Combine and Load or Combine and Load To, which
7:19 will allow you to select where you want to load it to. Let's go into Combine and Transform Data.
7:25 This is going to open the Power Query Editor window, and we'll just have a quick look at
7:29 what options are available. The first thing it asks is whether it's detected the region
7:34 correctly. And we get a preview of the data here. It looks fine. So I'm going to click okay.
7:40 Here in the Power Query Editor window on the left, we have the queries that
7:44 were automatically created to combine the files. In the center, we have a preview
7:48 of the data. And you can see here we've got the data from each month's CSV file.
7:53 In the ribbon, we've got various tools to clean and transform the data like removing
7:58 rows, splitting columns, and grouping the data. And on the Transform tab, there's even more common
8:04 data cleaning tools like unpivoting columns, filling up or down, replacing values, and so on.
8:11 Now, this data is pretty tidy. However, I have got the file name included in the table, which
8:16 I don't need. So, with that column selected, I'm just going to press the delete key to remove it.
8:22 Now over on the right we can see the Applied Steps pane and this lists all
8:25 the steps that have been taken so far. They've been recorded much like a macro
8:30 and this means we can use this query again next month when we get the new CSV file.
8:35 So once you've finished cleaning the data go to the Home tab, Close and Load and you want
8:40 Close and Load To. This is going to allow you to choose where to import the data.
8:45 The default is a table in the current workbook, but you can go straight to a PivotTable report,
8:50 PivotChart, or create a connection and load it to the data model, aka Power Pivot.
8:56 I'm going to load it direct to a PivotTable report. That's going to help keep my file size
9:00 small because I won't have the data in a table in the worksheet and a PivotTable. I'll click okay,
9:08 and we get the field list with the three fields. So I can summarize my data by date,
9:13 region, and let's look at the revenue. You can see it's automatically grouped the data by months.
9:20 So when next month comes around, all I need to do is place the new
9:23 file in the same folder. There's July's data. Go back to Excel,
9:28 right click on the PivotTable, and refresh. And just like that, we now have July's data.
9:35 And of course, if you have multiple reports connected to the query, you can update them
9:39 all in one go via the Data tab and then Refresh All. With Power Query, you have scalable automatic
9:45 data cleaning and gathering every time, so you can spend more time on the fun stuff.
9:50 And our most recent feature, Dynamic Arrays, is no less impressive. Dynamic Arrays changed
9:55 the way formulas return results, going from a single cell to being able to return multiple
9:59 results that automatically spill and resize as your data changes.
10:04 No helper columns and no messing around with Ctrl+Shift+Enter.
10:08 For example, we can easily build a summary of this table by year and category. I'll
10:13 start with the UNIQUE function and I want to get a list of the years. Close parentheses.
10:19 However, it would be good if they were sorted. So, let's edit that and wrap
10:23 that in the SORT function. Press Enter. And now the years are sorted correctly.
10:28 By the way, I've got some conditional formatting on these cells to reveal the
10:31 borders when I entered that first formula. It's not part of the formula functionality.
10:36 Next, we want to list the categories across the columns. So, I'm going to start with the
10:40 TRANSPOSE function, and I want them sorted. And I just need to grab a UNIQUE list of the
10:46 categories from the category column. Close UNIQUE, close SORT, close TRANSPOSE. And that's done.
10:53 And now I can simply use SUMIFS to aggregate the sales. The first criteria range is my year
11:01 and the criteria is the spilled array in this cell here. Now in order to reference
11:07 the spilled array, I can simply reference that first cell and then place a hash on
11:12 the end. Notice it's now picking up all the cells in that spilled array.
11:17 And by doing this, when I add new data to this table, that spilled array is
11:21 going to grow by one year. And my SUMIFS formula will automatically include it.
11:26 Next is the criteria range for the categories. And where are those listed? In this spilled
11:32 array here. So it's the first cell followed by the hash. Close parenthesis on SUMIFS.
11:38 Press Enter. And just like that, we've got a dynamic summary of our data that
11:42 will automatically update and expand as new data is added to this table.
11:47 Now another way we can build this summary is with the new PIVOTBY function which effectively
11:51 builds a PivotTable with a single formula. The first argument are the row fields. So we
11:56 want the years in the rows. Then the columns we want the categories. The values we want
12:02 to aggregate are the sales and the function where we can choose from these functions or
12:06 we can write our own LAMBDA. I just want to SUM them. So we're going to use SUM.
12:11 And then there's some further optional arguments. But I can stop here and get a PivotTable with
12:16 the row and column labels automatically sorted. And I have totals for my columns and
12:23 rows. Again, I've got some conditional formatting to reveal the cell borders.
12:27 But perhaps the best feature of these Dynamic Array formulas is the way they automatically
12:32 adapt as we add more data. I'm just going to freeze the panes here. So on the View tab,
12:38 going to Freeze Panes so that I can scroll to the bottom of the table.
12:43 And keep your eye on the summary tables because in the very next
12:46 row underneath the table, I'm going to add data for 2026. Just going to copy it down from the
12:52 row above. And as my table expands, so did my summary tables, which is very cool.
13:00 Each of these features are great on their own, but you can see the real
13:03 power of Excel comes when we combine them to make dynamic reports and tools.
13:08 But here's the thing. Features are only half the story. The other half is how you set up
13:12 Excel itself. Small changes in your settings can completely change the way you work day-to-day.
13:18 So, if you want to keep building on what we've covered today,
13:21 check out this video next. It'll show you the exact settings I recommend. Plus,
13:25 there's a free cheat sheet to make them easy to apply. So, click here and I'll walk you through.
