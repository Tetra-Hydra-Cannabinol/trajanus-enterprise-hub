0:00 in this video I'm going to share with
0:02 you the 10 most important intermediate
0:04 level Excel functions everyone should
0:07 know now I've chosen them based on years
0:10 of teaching Excel and answering Excel
0:12 questions that users would have
0:14 benefited from had they known these
0:16 functions earlier in their Excel Journey
0:19 now the purpose of this video is to
0:21 introduce the functions to you with an
0:23 example and then point you to tutorials
0:25 where you can dive deeper with more
0:27 examples now there's an Excel file you
0:29 can download from the link in the video
0:31 description with all the examples in
0:33 this video and links to more tutorials
0:35 so you can use it as a
0:37 resource let's start with the IF
0:39 function which enables you to perform a
0:42 logical test and then return one of two
0:44 results depending on the outcome of the
0:46 logical test for example let's say we
0:48 want to classify these items as due or
0:51 not due and an item becomes due 90 days
0:54 after the loan date to write the formula
0:57 we start with if and the first argument
1:00 is The Logical test and then we have the
1:03 result if the logical test is true and
1:05 the result if the logical test is false
1:09 for this we need to find today's date
1:11 and we can use the today function to
1:13 automatically return that minus the loan
1:16 date and if that's greater than or equal
1:19 to
1:20 90 then the value of true is the word
1:24 due otherwise if it's not due we're just
1:28 going to return a blank which we denote
1:30 by two double quotes close parentheses
1:33 on if and press enter Because this is in
1:36 a table it automatically copies down now
1:40 instead of returning a blank we could
1:42 change that and enter the text not doe
1:46 and of course if we returned a number
1:48 here or here we wouldn't need the double
1:51 quotes we only need double quotes when
1:53 we're entering text so that's a quick
1:55 example of a single if formula let's
1:58 take a look at nested if form
2:00 formulas nested ifs allow you to handle
2:03 more logical tests and return different
2:05 results accordingly for example let's
2:08 say that loan items greater than 90 days
2:10 old are classified as overdue items
2:13 equal to 90 days old are due and items
2:16 less than 90 days old are not due we
2:20 start with the first if and our first
2:22 logical test again uses the today
2:24 function to get today's date minus the
2:28 loan date if this this is greater than
2:30 90 90 days then it's
2:34 overdue now we need another logical test
2:37 so we need to enter if again and again
2:41 we want today's date minus the loan date
2:45 and if it's equal to 90 then this is due
2:50 and lastly everything else is not due so
2:53 we can simply enter not due in the value
2:55 of false argument we need to close the
2:58 parentheses twice because we have have
2:59 two if formulas in here press enter and
3:03 you can see we've got two that are
3:05 overdue one that's due and two that are
3:07 not due yet now it's essential that you
3:10 get the order of the logical tests in a
3:13 nestive formula correct because as soon
3:15 as a logical test returns true the
3:17 formula stops evaluating it's not so
3:20 much an issue with this formula but it's
3:21 a common mistake I see people make and
3:23 they wonder why their formulas only
3:25 return the first result now if you have
3:28 Excel 2019 onward or Microsoft 365 then
3:32 you have access to the new and easier to
3:34 use ifs
3:36 formula the ifs formula simplifies
3:38 nesting ifs for example we can write the
3:41 same formula here using ifs it groups
3:44 The Logical tests and the result if true
3:46 my first logical test is if today's date
3:50 minus the loan date is greater than 90
3:55 then it's overdue and then we have the
3:58 next logical test so I don't need
3:59 another if here I can simply go straight
4:01 into the next logical test so again we
4:05 want today's date minus the loan date
4:09 and if it's equal to 90 then it's due
4:13 now lastly because there's no value of
4:15 false argument in the ifs function we
4:18 skip the last logical test and simply
4:20 enter true that's going to tell Excel to
4:24 return the last value of true argument
4:26 and in this case it's not due now should
4:29 point out that just like the nested ifs
4:31 formulas ifs also stops evaluating once
4:34 a logical test evaluates to true so it's
4:37 important to get your logical tests in
4:38 the correct order and if we take this as
4:40 an example if this logical test is false
4:44 it goes to the next one if this is false
4:48 it goes to the next one now because
4:50 there's no logical test in here it's
4:52 already true it therefore Returns the
4:55 last value of true so let's close
4:58 parentheses on if
5:00 and you can see we get the same result
5:02 as the previous nested if example except
5:04 in a more succinct and easier to write
5:07 formula now for more on the ifs
5:09 functions and common mistakes people
5:11 make see the link in the video
5:12 description for my comprehensive
5:14 tutorial The Next Step Up from if
5:16 formulas is CH use the and function or
5:19 or function in your logical test so
5:22 let's take a look at that
5:23 next we'll start with the and function
5:26 which belongs to the logic family of
5:28 functions it's it's useful when you have
5:30 multiple conditions that must be met for
5:32 example taking the data here we could
5:34 test to see if the TV personality is
5:37 popular and if they earn less than 100K
5:40 and if both tests are true they get a
5:42 bonus so to write the formula we start
5:45 with if and The Logical test is going to
5:47 use and this is going to allow us to
5:50 insert multiple logical tests the first
5:52 one is whether they're popular so
5:54 whether this sell equals yes the second
5:57 one is whether the salary and we just
6:00 need to get to that field is less than
6:03 100 close parentheses on and if both of
6:07 those are true then it's going to take
6:09 the salary and times it by 10% otherwise
6:13 they get no
6:15 bonus close parenthesis on if and you
6:18 can see igle piggle MAA Paka and Mr
6:22 Maker all get
6:24 bonuses your function is useful when
6:26 you're happy if one or another condition
6:28 is met for example taking the data here
6:31 which is the same as we just looked at
6:33 we could test to see if the TV
6:35 personality is popular or if they earn
6:37 less than 100K that is as long as either
6:40 test is met they get a bonus so again
6:42 starting with if and then The Logical
6:44 test we're going to use or and we're
6:47 checking whether they're
6:49 popular or if the salary is less than
6:53 100K close parenthesis now of course you
6:56 could add more logical tests if you want
6:58 to you in this example I only need two
7:01 now if either of these is true then
7:03 we're going to take 10% of their salary
7:06 as the
7:07 bonus otherwise they get no bonus close
7:11 parentheses and you can see everyone
7:13 except Spider-Man gets a bonus now of
7:16 course you can write nested if formulas
7:18 that use both and and or criteria if
7:21 you're struggling to write if formulas
7:23 we've written an if formula Builder tool
7:25 that will build if formulas for you and
7:28 you can download it from the link in the
7:29 video
7:31 description the sum FS function enables
7:34 you to sum cells where they meet one or
7:36 more criteria taking the data here let's
7:39 say I want to sum the totals where the
7:41 region is the region in cell
7:44 D15 and the Builder is the Builder
7:47 listed in column e so let's take a look
7:49 some ifs the range we want to sum is the
7:53 total let's F4 to Absolute that the
7:57 first criteria range is the region and
8:01 again F4 to Absolute the
8:04 references and the region is this one
8:06 here F4 that as well and this is just so
8:08 when we copy it down it stays locked on
8:10 those
8:11 cells the next criteria is the Builder
8:14 range F4 to Absolute and the Builder for
8:18 the first Formula is this one here and
8:20 I'm not going to Absolute that CU I want
8:22 it to move down to the next row as I
8:25 copy it down we can continue to add more
8:28 criteria in this case I only have two
8:30 close parentheses and that's my sum if
8:35 if we copy it down you can see both Doug
8:37 and Brian have Sals in the central
8:40 region now I can use my drop down this
8:43 here to choose a different region you
8:45 can see Dave is the only Builder with
8:46 Sals in the east region and the North
8:50 Region Brian in the South and Larry in
8:54 the west region so as you may have
8:56 noticed with some ifs all criteria must
8:59 be met for the formula to include the
9:01 values in the sum now if you require all
9:04 criteria then you can use the sum
9:07 product function and I'll put a link to
9:09 a tutorial on Su product in the video
9:12 description well now that you know how
9:14 to use sum FS you'll find the other ifs
9:16 functions like count ifs average ifs Min
9:18 ifs and Max ifs easy because they all
9:21 use the same syntax so give them a try
9:25 too the subtotal function enables you to
9:28 work with hidden rows and choose whether
9:30 you include or exclude values on rows
9:33 that are hidden here I've got a table of
9:35 data containing programs and viewer
9:37 numbers for those programs with subtotal
9:40 I can aggregate the values using 11
9:43 different methods ranging from average
9:45 through to sum and even variance let's
9:48 say I want to sum the number of viewers
9:50 whether they're on rows that are hidden
9:51 or not so in that case you can see in
9:54 this First Column we have the numbers
9:56 for the functions that will include
9:59 hidden values and we can see that sum is
10:01 number nine so I can choose it from the
10:04 list here and the next argument is
10:06 simply the range that I want to sum so
10:08 it's these viewers here close
10:10 parentheses and press enter we can see
10:13 it Returns the same value as the total
10:15 of the
10:16 table now the other option I have is to
10:18 sum the values and ignore any values on
10:20 hidden rows so using subtotal again this
10:24 time I want to find the function number
10:27 from this column here on the right
10:29 because these are the ones that ignore
10:30 hidden values so that's a 109 now I can
10:33 just type it in if I know it off the top
10:35 of my head and again the range is this
10:38 range of cells here so right now they
10:41 look the same they're both returning the
10:42 same result because no rows are hidden
10:45 let's say I just select a few rows and
10:47 then hide them you can see this version
10:51 where the function number is 109
10:53 excludes the hidden rows this one here
10:56 includes all rows now the other thing
10:59 thing that subtotal does is
11:00 automatically exclude any values that
11:03 result from other subtotal formulas for
11:05 example if I extended this range to
11:08 include this bottom row here you'll see
11:10 the total remains 1591 and that's
11:14 because this cell here also contains a
11:16 subtotal
11:17 function let's just unhide those hidden
11:21 cells you can see if we change this one
11:25 to include that bottom row it also
11:27 ignores that subt total function in the
11:30 formula result so it's super handy if
11:33 you were to have subtotals interspersed
11:36 in this data for example after each
11:38 program any other subtotal functions
11:41 would ignore those
11:42 subtotals now one thing to note about
11:45 the subtotal function is if you format
11:47 your data in an Excel table for example
11:49 you select this data and insert table or
11:54 contrl t which is the keyboard shortcut
11:57 or if there are any other Excel tables
11:59 on the same sheet where you have
12:01 subtotal formulas all function numbers
12:03 will exclude values on hidden rows once
12:06 you apply filters in the table even if
12:08 you unfilter it and later hide rows it
12:10 seems to be a bug related to excel
12:12 tables and the subtotal function
12:14 probably because subtotal was around way
12:17 before Excel
12:20 tables the aggregate function does the
12:22 same as the subtotal function and more I
12:26 call it the Swiss army knife of
12:27 functions like subtotal the first
12:30 argument is the type of aggregation that
12:32 you want to perform except there are
12:34 even more available than we have with
12:37 subtotal as you can see from this
12:39 list so let's say we want to sum again
12:43 it's number nine the next option is to
12:46 choose how we want the function to
12:47 behave in regard to ignoring other
12:49 nested subtotal and aggregate functions
12:52 how it handles hidden or filtered rows
12:55 and error values now the nice thing
12:57 about aggregate is it works as well with
12:59 tables so when you use behavior number
13:01 four for example and tell it to ignore
13:03 nothing it will include rows that are
13:05 hidden by filters or by hiding rows now
13:09 let's say I want to sum the viewers and
13:11 ignore any rows that are hidden or
13:13 filtered so I want number five ignore
13:16 hidden rows then the next argument is
13:19 simply to select the range that I want
13:22 to sum close
13:24 parentheses and you can see it returns
13:27 1640 which is the same for the total of
13:29 the table now if I choose to filter out
13:32 some regions for example East it
13:35 excludes them
13:36 correctly I can change this to
13:39 four and if you remember four was to
13:42 ignore nothing so it should include all
13:44 the rows and go back to 1640 so you can
13:47 see aggregate works correctly with Excel
13:50 tables now there are loads more cool
13:52 things you can do with the aggregate
13:54 function so I'll put a link in the video
13:57 description to another tutorial where I
13:58 cover them in more
14:00 detail xlookup is the new improved
14:03 version of vlookup which is available in
14:06 Xcel 20121 and 365 now if you don't have
14:09 one of these versions of excel then you
14:10 can use V lookup or index and match
14:12 which I'll cover next xook up enables
14:15 you to look up a value in a list and
14:17 return a value from a corresponding
14:19 column for example I can look up the
14:22 value gloves in cell
14:24 F7 in the product column here and return
14:29 the sales amount from this column
14:32 here so you can see it's really easy to
14:35 use now there's a lot more to xook up
14:37 including all the optional arguments
14:39 which I didn't cover I've included a
14:42 link in the video description to a
14:43 comprehensive tutorial on xlookup I also
14:46 explain why it's better than vlookup so
14:48 I encourage you to watch it and start
14:50 using xlookup in your own work now if
14:53 you don't have X lookup you can do the
14:55 same lookup using vlookup so again we're
14:57 going to look up glass
14:59 in this range of sales here the column
15:03 that I want returned is the sales column
15:05 which is the second column in the range
15:06 I selected and I want an exact match so
15:10 we want false you can see it Returns the
15:13 same amount now there are some issues
15:15 with relookup that are fixed with the
15:17 xlookup function so if you have XL 2021
15:20 or 365 then you should ditch vlookup for
15:24 X
15:25 lookup a more robust formula option
15:28 available to those who don't have X look
15:30 up is index and match the match function
15:33 finds the row containing the value you
15:35 want to look up and index Returns the
15:37 value or range of values so if we just
15:40 take a look at match we want to let's
15:43 say look up the value Ben 10 in this
15:47 range of cells here and we want to find
15:49 an exact match which is zero close
15:52 parentheses and it returns three so it's
15:55 telling me that Ben 10 is on the third
15:58 row of of the range of cells that I
15:59 selected and we can see it is there
16:02 match can also look up horizontally so
16:05 if we want to look up the region in this
16:09 row here and again we want an exact
16:12 match you can see it finds South as the
16:14 fourth
16:15 column and then to replicate the vlookup
16:18 behavior we can use
16:20 index to look up this
16:23 table and we want to find Ben 10 which
16:26 is on the third row
16:29 and we want the fourth column for the
16:31 South
16:33 Region you can see there returns
16:37 125 now better way to write this is
16:40 rather than referencing other cells we
16:42 can actually Nest the match function
16:44 inside of index so let's say I want to
16:47 match Ben 10 in this column here and I
16:51 want an exact match and then for the
16:54 column number I want to match South in
16:58 this row here and I want an exact match
17:01 close parentheses on Match close it on
17:04 index and there's my result and now if I
17:07 change the program selected my index and
17:12 match formula automatically
17:15 updates now if there's one function that
17:17 you should really take the time to learn
17:20 it's the index function it can do way
17:22 more than the lookups I've shown you
17:24 here and in my opinion it is the most
17:26 useful function in Excel now I've
17:28 recorded a video on five things most
17:30 people don't know about index which you
17:32 can see at the link in the video
17:35 description the next lookup function I
17:38 want to show you is filter and this is
17:40 available in EXL 2021 and 365 with
17:44 Filter we can reference a range of sales
17:45 and return the rows or columns that
17:47 match criteria that we specify for
17:50 example let's say I want to extract the
17:51 sales records from this table we start
17:54 with Filter I want to place them here
17:57 and I want to filter this range of sales
18:00 and I want to include the
18:02 department where it equals
18:06 sales and if it can't find any
18:08 departments called sales I want it to
18:11 return no records it's just text that
18:13 I've entered in there press enter and it
18:15 spills the results to the rows and
18:17 columns below now there are loads more
18:20 cool things filter can do including just
18:22 returning some of the columns or one
18:25 column which can then be nested inside
18:27 other functions ET ET if you have Excel
18:30 2021 or 365 I encourage you to watch my
18:32 comprehensive filter tutorial link to in
18:35 the video description because this is an
18:37 incredibly useful
18:40 function the if error function is Handy
18:43 for hiding error values returned by
18:45 other formulas or to return an alternate
18:48 result other than an ugly error message
18:50 for example here I have V lookup formula
18:53 that's returning errors for Doug because
18:54 he's not found in the commission rates
18:57 table which is the table being looked up
18:59 now instead of showing # na in my report
19:02 I can wrap the vlookup formula in if
19:05 error so if I just go up to the formula
19:07 bar add it
19:09 in the value is the value returned by V
19:13 lookup and the value if error I want
19:16 returned is just going to be the text
19:19 missing close parentheses on if error
19:22 and now instead of the error I get
19:26 missing now if error can be used to hide
19:28 any error alternatively with na errors
19:32 like we have with vlookup I can replace
19:34 if error with the shorter if na function
19:37 works exactly the same way takes a value
19:40 and then if that value Returns the na
19:42 error you can insert some alternate text
19:45 or you could just return a blank as
19:48 denoted by two double
19:50 quotes so you can see if na Works in
19:53 exactly the same way but it's limited to
19:55 those na
19:57 errors nearly everyone who uses Excel
20:00 works with dates and a super handy
20:02 function is EO month short for end of
20:05 month which Returns the last day of the
20:07 month before or after a start date for
20:10 example here I've got some dates and if
20:13 I want to find the end of the month
20:16 based on this start date and the number
20:18 of months I want to extend by is this
20:22 value here so in this case 1
20:24 month it's going to give me the 30th of
20:27 April so it's the end of month one month
20:29 after the current date let's just I'm
20:32 going to right click and drag and then
20:35 fill without
20:36 formatting so you can see here this date
20:39 has taken it back 1 month
20:41 earlier this one has just found the end
20:44 of the current month it handles leap PE
20:49 and so on now one thing to note here is
20:51 if you enter a fraction of a month so
20:54 for example 1 and a half months you can
20:56 see it just rounds it down to 1 month
20:58 month so any fractions of months are
21:00 ignored now there's no start of month
21:03 function but you can also use end of
21:05 month to find the start of the month for
21:07 example here I found the end of the
21:09 month previous to the current month all
21:12 I need to do is add one and now I get
21:15 the start of the current
21:17 month the eatee function rolls a date
21:20 serial number forward or backward let's
21:22 take a look so here we've got the start
21:25 date which is this date here and then
21:27 the number of months I'm going to use
21:30 this cell here so in this case I'm
21:32 adding a month so that takes me forward
21:34 to the 15th of April which is 31 days
21:37 let's right click and drag down fill
21:40 without formatting this is taken it back
21:43 one month forward one month you can see
21:46 leap years are handled without a
21:49 problem and so on and again if you enter
21:52 a fraction of a month it rounds it down
21:54 to the nearest whole month so in this
21:56 example it's only Taking It Forward 6
21:59 months not
22:01 6.8 the get pivot data function extracts
22:04 values from pivot tables and it will
22:06 dynamically update even if the pivot
22:08 table changes shape it's super useful if
22:11 you're building reports and you don't
22:12 want a bulky pivot table taking up loads
22:15 of space for example let's say I want to
22:17 get the grand total for the USA all I
22:19 need to do is enter the equal sign and
22:21 select the cell containing the grand
22:23 total and Excel even writes the formula
22:25 for me now the beauty of this this is
22:28 that if the column containing the USA
22:30 grand total moves for example let's say
22:32 I want it before the UK instead I
22:35 haven't had to change my formula it's
22:37 still picking up this value here
22:39 similarly if I add more data to the
22:41 pivot table let's add some data for
22:45 2010 now the grand total is down here
22:48 it's correctly picking up the new grand
22:50 total the other thing I can do is make
22:52 it Dynamic by referencing any hard keyed
22:55 areas with a cell reference instead of
22:57 that hog key text so here I can
22:59 reference the cell containing the
23:01 country name and then because this is a
23:04 data validation list I can choose the UK
23:07 and it updates to return the correct
23:10 value now there's a lot more to get
23:12 pivot data that I cover in a
23:15 comprehensive video which you'll find
23:17 linked to in the video description so I
23:19 encourage you to take a look at that
23:21 because using get pivot data to build
23:23 your reports is going to make them far
23:25 more robust than regular sell ref
23:27 references particularly when referencing
23:30 pivot
23:31 tables I hope you'll find the functions
23:33 covered in this video useful you can
