0:00 writing Excel formulas is one of the
0:02 most important tasks to master in Excel
0:05 but it can be a mindfield trying to get
0:07 your head around all the functions
0:09 available and knowing which one to use
0:11 for the task at hand but now with this
0:13 free AI aided formula editor you can
0:16 have it write the formulas for you from
0:18 inside Excel it can also explain how
0:21 existing formulas work and suggest
0:24 improvements and tutorials to help you
0:26 learn let's take a look the editor is
0:29 free to download from the insert tab get
0:34 addins and then simply enter AI aided
0:37 formula editor click on
0:40 search and it's this first one here
0:42 click add agree to the terms and
0:45 conditions and click continue I've
0:47 already inserted it so I'm going to
0:50 close out of here and you'll notice I've
0:52 got a new tab on my ribbon containing
0:54 the tools it's the first one here the
0:57 other two we've got documentation and
0:59 then help desk if you want to get in
1:00 touch with the developers so let's open
1:03 it up it opens a pane on the right hand
1:05 side and you can use the pull handle
1:07 here to make it wider or you can left
1:10 click and drag it from the top and bring
1:12 it out into a separate floating
1:15 window to activate the AI generator part
1:19 click on the button here and then we get
1:21 the field at the top where we can
1:23 describe our formula so let's give it a
1:25 go the table here is called table one
1:28 and I want to count the number of
1:31 components where sales are greater than
1:34 3,000 so I'm going to describe my
1:38 formula now I've used the table name and
1:41 column names because it's in a Excel
1:43 table so I want it to use the structured
1:45 references however if your data is not
1:48 in an Excel table then you'd enter in
1:50 the cell references here in this case it
1:53 would be D2 through to
1:55 d18 and the category column would be B2
1:59 through to B18 18 so I've entered in my
2:01 formula description I can click the
2:03 submit button or I can use the keyboard
2:05 shortcut control enter and AI is going
2:09 away and it's figuring out how to write
2:11 my formula and there it is notice it's
2:15 nicely laid out and colorcoded making it
2:17 really easy to read you can click on the
2:19 thumbs up or thumbs down to give the AI
2:21 feedback and if you don't get the answer
2:23 you want you can click the submit button
2:25 again or you might want to reord your
2:28 description to make it clear
2:31 now if I want to use the formula I
2:32 simply click the arrow button to write
2:34 it to the cell notice that in the
2:36 formula bar that it hasn't applied this
2:38 nice formatting that we see down here
2:40 you can copy it out if you prefer and
2:43 paste it in and now if we make the
2:45 formula bar wider you can see it there
2:48 in the cell the color coding disappears
2:50 unless you're in edit mode if you want
2:53 the formula explained you can select it
2:55 all and hover over the blue section you
2:58 can see it's loading the
3:00 explanation it's told me the result is
3:03 three and then in plain English it
3:05 explains what the formula is doing so
3:07 it's super helpful alternatively you can
3:10 click on the comment icon here and then
3:13 down in the console you'll see it's
3:16 evaluated it and it'll be thinking about
3:19 the explanation and there it is there
3:22 and that will stay there until you clear
3:23 it let's clear that so that it's ready
3:26 for our next example in the right
3:28 formula section you can also write your
3:30 own formula so let's say I prefer to do
3:33 this with some product I wouldn't but
3:35 let's just go with it for this example
3:38 notice it doesn't have the Intellis
3:39 sense doesn't autocomplete for me so I
3:43 want where table one sales are greater
3:46 than
3:47 3,000 and table on category equals
3:52 components now I haven't formatted it
3:55 very nicely so we can click on this
3:56 button here and it will apply the
3:58 formatting let's just make window a
4:00 little bit bigger and if I want to use
4:03 that formula I can click the arrow key
4:05 to write it to the cell that's selected
4:07 again it hasn't brought in the
4:08 formatting with all the carriage returns
4:10 so we can copy it out and paste it
4:12 directly in the formula
4:19 bar the AI AED formula editor can also
4:22 help you understand formulas simply
4:25 select the cell containing the formula
4:28 I'm going to turn off the AI generator
4:30 part cuz I don't need that anymore I'm
4:31 just working with the current cell
4:33 formula and then I can select it all and
4:36 hover my mouse over it it comes up with
4:39 the result it also gives me a suggestion
4:42 of how I can improve the formula and it
4:45 explains what the formula is currently
4:48 doing like we saw previously we can also
4:50 click on the comment icon here and then
4:53 go down to the console and see the
4:55 results there if that's
4:57 easier if you're working with with large
5:00 formulas that have lots of nested
5:01 functions you can collapse parts of it
5:04 to make it easier to work
5:06 with you can also pin a formula so
5:09 clicking on the pin icon here I can then
5:11 navigate to another formula so I can go
5:13 over to this sheet here I can look at
5:16 this cell but notice that it doesn't
5:18 replace the formula that it's displaying
5:21 so I'm able to bring this formula with
5:23 me and if I wanted to I could select a
5:26 cell and write it to a different cell
5:29 this is if you want to copy the formula
5:30 to another cell or when you're
5:32 troubleshooting other formulas that
5:34 might be linked for
5:39 example if the formula can be simplified
5:41 or modified it will display a yellow
5:43 wavy line under the relevant sections
5:46 and hovering over this displays the
5:48 current formula and the suggested
5:50 alternative so we can see here it's
5:52 suggesting that we replace the nested IF
5:55 function with the newer ifs function we
5:58 can also see a video tutorial it's going
6:00 to take us to YouTube if we want to
6:03 navigate specifically to the problem
6:05 area you can use the shortcut key alt f8
6:08 or click the link so here it's told me
6:11 this is one of one problems the netive
6:13 functions can be replaced by ifs pretty
6:17 cool huh now if we want to go ahead and
6:20 use the suggested formula you can copy
6:22 it out of the dialogue box here and then
6:26 paste it into the formula bar
6:31 and notice the yellow wavy Line's gone
6:33 away it's happy with this version of the
6:35 formula now currently this feature is
6:38 limited to a specific list of scenarios
6:40 and it's not available for all functions
6:42 so don't be surprised if it doesn't pop
6:44 up when you might expect it
6:49 to the AI tool behind the formula editor
6:52 is based on open AI codex which is a
6:55 descendant of gpt3 and the same AI that
6:58 powers GitHub Hub co-pilot that means
7:01 it's not familiar with information post
7:03 2021 and it isn't aware of some of the
7:06 new functions Excel has like text split
7:08 Etc that were added in
7:11 2022 for example if I ask it to write a
7:14 formula that splits text after each
7:17 comma it returns this convoluted trim
7:20 mid substitute formula I'm not even sure
7:23 if it'll work let's pop it in no it
7:25 doesn't it only returns speaker it's not
7:27 aware that we have text split but if you
7:29 have a version of excel that does you
7:31 can actually ask it to use text spit and
7:36 click
7:37 submit and it manages to write it
7:40 correctly it just won't use it unless
7:42 you prompt it to keep in mind that open
7:45 AI codex is still being developed So
7:48 currently it won't get every answer
7:50 right and it's not great at Super
7:53 Advanced formulas like lambdas however
7:55 over time it will improve and in the
7:57 meantime if it doesn't give you the
7:59 desired answer you can click the submit
8:01 button again to try and get a different
8:04 response if not try rephrasing your
8:07 question and providing more specific
8:10 instructions obviously the clearer your
8:12 question the more likely you are to get
8:14 the correct answer I hope you found this
8:17 tutorial useful go ahead and download
8:19 the AI AED formula editor and try it out
