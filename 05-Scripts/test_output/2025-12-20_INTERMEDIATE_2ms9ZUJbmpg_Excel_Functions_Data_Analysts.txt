0:00 the other day I stumbled upon a post
0:01 claiming to list the top Excel functions
0:04 for data analysts I disagreed with half
0:06 the functions listed in that posts so I
0:08 did a search and I found a load more
0:11 posts with pretty much the same list
0:13 they probably copied each other in this
0:15 video I'm going to try and write those
0:17 wrongs by introducing you to what I know
0:19 are the top functions for data analysts
0:21 and the functions that you don't need to
0:23 worry about learning so much I'll cover
0:25 an example for each function and then
0:28 I'm going to point you to tutorials
0:29 where you you can dive deeper with more
0:32 examples there's also an Excel file that
0:34 you can download from the link in the
0:36 video description with all the examples
0:39 in this video and more and links to more
0:41 tutorials so you can use it as a
0:43 resource let's start with the IF
0:46 function which enables you to perform a
0:48 logical test and then return one of two
0:50 results depending on the outcome of the
0:52 logical test for example let's say we
0:55 want to classify these items as due or
0:57 not due an item becomes due 90 days
1:01 after the loan date now the if formula
1:04 takes three arguments The Logical test
1:07 the result if the logical test is true
1:09 and the result if the logical test is
1:11 false therefore the formula is if
1:14 today's date and we can use the today
1:16 function to dynamically return today's
1:18 date minus the loan date is greater than
1:23 or equal to 90 then the loan is due and
1:27 we can return the Text due now it's in
1:29 double quotes because it's text if you
1:31 were returning a number here you'd just
1:33 enter the number without the double
1:35 quotes otherwise let's return blank as
1:39 denoted by two double quotes
1:41 alternatively you could enter some text
1:43 in here like not do and then close
1:46 parentheses on if I've entered mine in a
1:49 table so it copies the formula down the
1:51 table automatically all right that's a
1:54 quick example of using a single if
1:56 formula let's take a look at nested IFS
2:00 nested ifs allow you to handle more
2:02 logical tests and return different
2:04 results accordingly for example let's
2:06 say loan items greater than 90 days old
2:08 are classified as overdue items equals
2:11 to 90 days old are classified as due and
2:14 items less than 90 days old a classified
2:16 as not due so the formula is if and
2:19 again we're going to use today to
2:21 dynamically return today's date minus
2:24 the loan date is greater than 90 then
2:28 it's overdue and then in the value of
2:31 false argument we simply enter another
2:33 if and a logical test again is if
2:36 today's date minus the loan date is
2:40 equal to 90 then it's due and then if
2:45 that's false then everything else must
2:47 be not due now I need to close my
2:50 parentheses twice once for each
2:53 if and you can see the results now it's
2:56 essential with nested ifs that you get
2:58 the order of the logical test tests
3:00 correct because as soon as a logical
3:02 test returns true the formula stops
3:05 evaluating it's not so much of an issue
3:07 with this formula but it's a common
3:09 mistake I see people make and they
3:10 wonder why their formulas only return
3:12 the first
3:14 result if you have Excel 2019 onward or
3:17 a Microsoft 365 license then you have
3:20 access to the new and easier to use ifs
3:22 function the ifs function simplifies
3:25 nesting ifs for example we can write the
3:27 same formula in groups of logical tests
3:31 and then the result if true so my first
3:34 logical test is again using the today
3:36 function minus the loan date and if
3:40 that's greater than 90 then it's
3:43 overdue then instead of writing another
3:45 if we just enter the next logical test
3:48 which is if today's date minus the loan
3:51 date equals 90 then it's
3:54 due and lastly because there's no value
3:57 of false argument in the ifs function we
3:59 skip the last logical test and simply
4:02 enter true and the last value if true is
4:05 the value we want returned in the event
4:07 of the previous logical test returning
4:09 false in this case we want it to return
4:12 the text not due now I should point out
4:15 that just like the nested ifs formulas
4:17 ifs also stops evaluating once a logical
4:20 test evaluates to true so remember to
4:23 get your logical test in the correct
4:25 order for more on the if functions and
4:27 common mistakes people make see the link
4:30 in the video description for my
4:31 comprehensive tutorial The Next Step Up
4:34 from if formulas is to use the and
4:36 function or or function in your criteria
4:39 arguments let's look at that
4:42 next we'll start with the and function
4:45 which belongs to the logic family of
4:46 functions it's useful when you have
4:49 multiple conditions that must be met for
4:51 example taking the data here we could
4:53 test to see if the TV personality is
4:55 popular and if they earn less than 100K
4:59 and if both tests are true they get a
5:01 bonus so to write the formula we start
5:03 with if and The Logical test is going to
5:06 use and this is going to allow us to
5:08 insert multiple logical tests the first
5:11 one is whether they're popular so
5:13 whether this cell equals yes the second
5:16 one is whether the salary and we just
5:18 need to get to that field is less than
5:21 100 close parentheses on and if both of
5:26 those are true then it's going to take
5:28 the salary and and times it by 10%
5:31 otherwise they get no
5:33 bonus close parentheses on if and you
5:37 can see igle piggle MAA Paka and Mr
5:40 Maker all get
5:43 bonuses the all function is useful when
5:45 you're happy if one or another condition
5:47 is met for example taking the data here
5:50 which is the same as we just looked at
5:51 we could test to see if the TV
5:53 personality is popular or if they earn
5:56 less than 100K that is as long as either
5:58 test is met they get a bonus so again
6:01 starting with if and then The Logical
6:03 test we're going to use or and we're
6:06 checking whether they're
6:07 popular or if the salary is less than
6:11 100K close parenthesis now of course you
6:14 could add more logical tests if you want
6:16 to in this example I only need two now
6:20 if either of these is true then we're
6:22 going to take 10% of their salary as the
6:25 bonus otherwise they get no bonus close
6:28 parenthesis
6:30 and you can see everyone except
6:31 Spider-Man gets a bonus now of course
6:34 you can write nested if formulas that
6:36 use both and and or criteria if you're
6:39 struggling to write if formulas we've
6:41 written an if formula Builder tool that
6:43 will build if formulas for you and you
6:45 can download it from the link in the
6:47 video
6:49 description the sum ifs function enables
6:51 you to sum cells where they meet one or
6:54 more criteria taking the data here let's
6:57 say I want to sum the totals whether Reg
6:59 region is the region in cell
7:02 D15 and the Builder is the Builder
7:04 listed in column e so let's take a look
7:07 some ifs the range we want to sum is the
7:11 total let's F4 to Absolute that the
7:15 first criteria range is the region and
7:18 again F4 to Absolute the
7:21 references and the Regent is this one
7:24 here f for that as well and this is just
7:26 so when we copy it down it stays locked
7:28 on those cells
7:30 the next criteria is the Builder range
7:33 F4 to Absolute and the Builder for the
7:36 first Formula is this one here and I'm
7:38 not going to Absolute that cuz I want it
7:40 to move down to the next row as I copy
7:43 it down we can continue to add more
7:45 criteria in this case I only have two
7:48 close parentheses and that's my sum if
7:52 if we copy it down you can see both Doug
7:55 and Brian have sales in the central
7:58 region now I can can use my drop down
8:00 this here to choose a different region
8:02 you can see Dave is the only Builder
8:04 with sales in the east region and the
8:07 North Region Brian in the South and
8:11 Larry in the west region so as you may
8:14 have noticed with some ifs all criteria
8:17 must be met for the formula to include
8:19 the values in the sum now if you require
8:22 all criteria then you can use the some
8:25 product function and I'll put a link to
8:27 a tutorial on some product in the video
8:29 description well now that you know how
8:31 to use sum ifs you'll find the other ifs
8:34 functions like count ifs average ifs Min
8:36 ifs and Maxes easy because they all use
8:39 the same syntax so give them a try
8:42 too X lookup is the new improved version
8:45 of vlookup which is available in Excel
8:48 2021 and 365 now if you don't have one
8:51 of these versions of excel then you can
8:53 use be lookup or index and match which
8:55 I'll cover next X lookup enables you to
8:57 look up a value in a list and and return
8:59 a value from a corresponding column for
9:02 example I can look up the value gloves
9:05 in cell
9:06 F7 in the product column here and return
9:11 the sales amount from this column
9:14 here so you can see it's really easy to
9:17 use now there's a lot more to X look up
9:19 including all the optional arguments
9:21 which I didn't cover I've included a
9:24 link in the video description to a
9:25 comprehensive tutorial on xlookup I also
9:28 explain why it's better than vlookup so
9:30 I encourage you to watch it and start
9:32 using xlookup in your own work now if
9:35 you don't have xlookup you can do the
9:37 same lookup using vlookup so again we're
9:39 going to look up gloves in this range of
9:42 cells here the column that I want
9:45 returned is the sales column which is
9:47 the second column in the range I
9:49 selected and I want an exact match so we
9:52 want false you can see it Returns the
9:55 same amount now there are some issues
9:57 with relook up that are fixed with the
9:59 xlookup function so if you have XL 2021
10:02 or 365 then you should ditch vlookup for
10:07 xlookup a more robust formula option
10:10 available to those who don't have X
10:11 lookup is index and match the match
10:15 function finds the row containing the
10:17 value you want to look up and index
10:19 Returns the value or range of values so
10:21 if we just take a look at match we want
10:24 to let's say look up the value Ben 10 in
10:28 this range of cells here and we want to
10:31 find an exact match which is zero close
10:34 parentheses and it returns three so it's
10:37 telling me that Ben 10 is on the third
10:40 row of the range of cells that I
10:41 selected and we can see it is there
10:44 match can also look up horizontally so
10:47 if we want to look up the region in this
10:51 row here and again we want an exact
10:53 match we can see it finds South as the
10:56 fourth
10:57 column and then to replicate the vlookup
11:00 behavior we can use
11:02 index to look up this
11:05 table and we want to find Ben 10 which
11:08 is on the third
11:10 row and we want the fourth column for
11:13 the South
11:15 Region you can see there it returns
11:19 125 now better way to write this is
11:22 rather than referencing other cells we
11:24 can actually Nest the match function
11:26 inside of index so let's say want to
11:29 match Ben 10 in this column here and I
11:33 want an exact match and then for the
11:36 column number I want to match South in
11:40 this row here and I want an exact match
11:43 close parentheses on Match close it on
11:46 index and there's my result and now if I
11:49 change the program selected my index and
11:54 match formula automatically
11:57 updates now if there's one function that
11:59 you should really take the time to learn
12:02 it's the index function it can do way
12:04 more than the lookups I've shown you
12:06 here and in my opinion it is the most
12:08 useful function in Excel now I've
12:10 recorded a video on five things most
12:12 people don't know about index which you
12:14 can see at the link in the video
12:17 description the next lookup function I
12:20 want to show you is filter and this is
12:22 available in Excel 2021 and 365 with
12:26 Filter we can reference a range of sales
12:27 and return the rows or columns that
12:29 match criteria that we specify for
12:32 example let's say I want to extract the
12:33 sales records from this table we start
12:36 with Filter I want to place them here
12:39 and I want to filter this range of cells
12:42 and I want to include the
12:44 department where it equals
12:48 sales and if it can't find any
12:50 departments called sales I want it to
12:53 return no records it's just text that
12:55 I've entered in there press enter and it
12:57 spills the results to the rows and
12:59 columns below now there are loads more
13:02 cool things filter can do including just
13:04 returning some of the columns or one
13:07 column which can then be nested inside
13:09 other functions Etc if you have Excel
13:12 2021 or 365 I encourage you to watch my
13:14 comprehensive filter tutorial link to in
13:17 the video description because this is an
13:19 incredibly useful
13:22 function the if error function is Handy
13:25 for hiding error values returned by
13:27 other formulas or to return an alternate
13:30 result other than an ugly error message
13:32 for example here I have a vlookup
13:34 formula that's returning errors for Doug
13:36 because he's not found in the commission
13:38 rates table which is the table being
13:40 looked up now instead of showing # na in
13:43 my report I can wrap the vlookup formula
13:47 in if error so if I just go up to the
13:49 formula bar add it
13:51 in the value is the value returned by V
13:55 lookup and the value if error I won't
13:58 return and is just going to be the text
14:01 missing close parentheses on if error
14:04 and now instead of the error I get
14:07 missing now if error can be used to hide
14:10 any error alternatively with na errors
14:14 like we have with v lookup I can replace
14:16 if error with the shorter if na function
14:19 works exactly the same way takes a value
14:22 and then if that value Returns the na
14:24 error you can insert some alternate text
14:27 or you could just return turn a blank as
14:30 denoted by two double
14:32 quotes so you can see if na a Works in
14:35 exactly the same way but it's limited to
14:37 those na
14:39 errors nearly everyone who uses Excel
14:42 works with dates and a super handy
14:44 function is EO month short for end of
14:47 month which Returns the last day of the
14:49 month before or after a start date for
14:52 example here I've got some dates and if
14:55 I want to find the end of the month
14:58 based on this start date and the number
15:00 of months I want to extend by is this
15:04 value here so in this case 1
15:06 month it's going to give me the 30th of
15:09 April so it's the end of month one month
15:11 after the current date let's just I'm
15:14 going to right click and drag and then
15:17 fill without
15:18 formatting so you can see here this date
15:21 has taken it back one month
15:23 earlier this one has just found the end
15:26 of the current month it has hand Les
15:29 leap years and so on now one thing to
15:32 note here is if you enter a fraction of
15:35 a month so for example 1 and A2 months
15:38 you can see it just rounds it down to 1
15:40 month so any fractions of months are
15:42 ignored now there's no start of month
15:45 function but you can also use end of
15:47 month to find the start of the month for
15:49 example here I found the end of the
15:51 month previous to the current month all
15:54 I need to do is add one and now I get
15:57 the start of the current month
16:00 the eate function rolls a date serial
16:02 number forward or backward let's take a
16:05 look so here we've got the start date
16:07 which is this date here and then the
16:09 number of months I'm going to use this
16:12 cell here so in this case I'm adding a
16:14 month so it takes me forward to the 15th
16:17 of April which is 31 days let's right
16:20 click and drag down fill without
16:23 formatting this has taken it back one
16:25 month forward one month you can see Le
16:28 years are handled without a
16:31 problem and so on and again if you enter
16:34 a fraction of a month it rounds it down
16:36 to the nearest whole month so in this
16:38 example it's only taking it Forward 6
16:41 months not
16:43 6.8 as a data analyst you'll typically
16:46 be working with dates a lot the network
16:48 Days International function Returns the
16:51 number of working days between two dates
16:53 excluding weekends and holidays for
16:56 example we can calculate the number of
16:58 work days between these start and end
17:00 dates simply reference the dates and I
17:03 should point out that Network Days
17:05 International is inclusive of the start
17:07 and end dates the next argument allows
17:09 you to specify which days are included
17:11 in the weekend there's a ton to choose
17:13 from as you can see here I've listed the
17:16 different options in column D so you can
17:18 see the effect but you typically just
17:20 choose one and hard key it into the
17:22 formula so I'm referencing column D and
17:25 then for the holidays you can specify a
17:27 list of dates that are holidays to
17:29 exclude as well it's optional you don't
17:31 have to list holidays close parentheses
17:34 on network days and you can see there
17:35 are 20 working days between the 1st and
17:38 31st of January where your weekend is on
17:41 a Saturday and Sunday and I can copy
17:43 that down I'm just going to fill without
17:46 formatting you can see the results based
17:49 on the different weekend
17:51 types now not many people know that you
17:53 can also exclude other days from the
17:56 work week by specifying them in array
17:59 where zero is a workday and one is a
18:02 non-work day so let's reference these
18:05 celles for our start and end dates and
18:08 then instead of picking from one of
18:10 these numbers I can reference this cell
18:11 here which contains the string of work
18:14 dayss here I want to count Monday
18:16 Tuesday and Wednesday's work days and
18:18 the rest are non-w work days we can also
18:21 specify holidays close parentheses and
18:25 you can see the results we can also hug
18:29 key the work days in the formula so
18:30 let's just take a look at how we do that
18:33 so instead of referencing the cell we're
18:35 just going to type them in in double
18:37 quotes Monday Tuesday Wednesday workdays
18:40 let's reference our holidays close
18:43 parentheses we get the same result the
18:45 only difference is the work date string
18:47 is inside the formula and this is
18:50 typically how you'd enter it you
18:51 wouldn't normally reference it in a
18:54 Cell the get pivot data function
18:56 extracts values from pivot table
18:58 and it will dynamically update even if
19:00 the pivot table changes shape it's super
19:03 useful if you're building reports and
19:05 you don't want a bulky pivot table
19:07 taking up loads of space for example
19:09 let's say I want to get the grand total
19:10 for the USA all I need to do is enter
19:13 the equal sign and select the cell
19:15 containing the grand total and Exel even
19:17 writes the formula for me now the beauty
19:20 of this is that if the column containing
19:22 the USA grand total moves for example
19:24 let's say I want it before the UK
19:26 instead I haven't had to change my
19:28 formula it's still picking up this value
19:31 here similarly if I add more data to the
19:34 pivot table let's add some data for
19:37 2010 now the grand total is down here
19:41 it's correctly picking up the new grand
19:43 total the other thing I can do is make
19:45 it Dynamic by referencing any hard keyed
19:48 areas with a cell reference instead of
19:50 that hard keyed text so here I can
19:52 reference the cell containing the
19:54 country name and then because this is a
19:57 data validation list I can choose the UK
20:00 and it updates to return the correct
20:03 value now there's a lot more to get
20:05 pivot data that I cover in a
20:07 comprehensive video which you'll find
20:09 linked to in the video description so I
20:11 encourage you to take a look at that
20:14 because using get pivot data to build
20:16 your reports is going to make them far
20:18 more robust than regular cell references
20:21 particularly when referencing pivot
20:24 tables the unique function generates a
20:26 list of distinct items from an array or
20:29 a list of items that only occur once
20:31 it's available in Excel 2021 onward or
20:34 with Microsoft 365 so for example I can
20:38 easily extract a list of distinct
20:40 products from this column here now the
20:44 last two arguments are optional I don't
20:46 need them in this case so I'm just going
20:48 to close parentheses and you can see it
20:50 spills the results to the cells below
20:52 because it's a dynamic array
20:54 alternatively I can extract a list of
20:57 unique items items that is a list of
21:00 items that only occur once so again I'm
21:03 going to select the products this time I
21:05 need to use my optional arguments I
21:07 don't need to use the by column this
21:10 simply allows you to compare values by
21:12 row instead of the default by column so
21:15 we're going to skip that and then the
21:17 last argument I need to specify true I
21:20 want to return items that appear exactly
21:22 once so tab to enter that close
21:25 parentheses and you can see there's only
21:27 one product that occurs once and that's
21:30 the product called
21:31 other with unique you can also reference
21:34 multiple columns so for example let's
21:37 say I want to look at rows where product
21:41 and quantity are distinct close
21:43 parentheses and you can see only 11 rows
21:47 were
21:49 returned the sort function does what
21:51 you'd expect and it's available in Excel
21:53 2021 onward and Microsoft 365 so let's
21:57 say I want to sort this data by item so
22:01 I'm going to select all of the data and
22:03 then the sort Index this is where I
22:06 specify which column I want to sort by
22:08 so I want to sort by item which is the
22:09 second column and then ascending or
22:12 descending we'll go with ascending which
22:14 is one and the last argument is whether
22:17 I want to sort by column which would be
22:19 true or by row which is the default so I
22:22 could Adit it or enter false let's enter
22:25 false just for completeness press enter
22:28 you can see now my data is sorted based
22:30 on the item
22:32 column I can also sort by multiple items
22:35 so selecting the table again and then
22:38 here in the sort index I simply enter an
22:41 array of column numbers surrounded by
22:43 curly braces and they don't have to be
22:46 in order so for example I could sort by
22:48 column 2 and then by column 1 or by
22:50 column 1 and then by column 2 or by any
22:53 of the other columns and notice it's
22:55 surrounded in curly braces and then I
22:58 can specify the sort order so let's sort
23:00 it in descending order close parentheses
23:04 and now we have our data sorted based on
23:06 department and then by item in
23:09 descending
23:11 order the sequence function returns a
23:14 list of sequential numbers in an array
23:16 among other things it will replace the
23:18 need to use the row or column function
23:20 to return an array of values for use
23:22 nested inside other functions it's
23:25 available in Excel 2021 onward and
23:28 365 so let's take a look here and let's
23:33 say I want to return five rows I want
23:35 just one column I want to start at five
23:38 and step by 10 close parentheses and
23:42 there's my list 5 15 25 35
23:45 45 we can also create 2D arrays of
23:49 numbers so again sequence here I want
23:52 three rows two columns I'm going to
23:55 start at two and step up by two close
23:58 parentheses and you can see it flows
24:01 left to right across the columns and
24:03 then down onto the next
24:05 row sequence also works great to
24:08 generate a list of dates and they can
24:10 count down for example let's say I want
24:13 a list of dates going across the rows so
24:15 I'll skip the first argument and then I
24:18 want five columns and I want to start at
24:21 January 31st so I'm going to use the
24:23 date function so I want January 31st
24:28 2023 close parentheses on date and then
24:31 I want to step down so it's minus one by
24:34 1 day at a time and there I have my five
24:37 dates spilled across the columns
24:40 decreasing by one day at a time there
24:43 are loads of more uses for the sequence
24:45 function and the functions covered so
24:46 far so be sure to check out the file for
24:48 this lesson available from the link in
24:51 the video description for more examples
24:54 okay that covers the most important
24:56 functions you need as a data analyst
24:58 let's look at some functions that were
25:00 included in some of the other lists I
25:02 saw online that I didn't agree with trim
25:05 function removes all spaces from a text
25:07 string except those between words now
25:10 it's a data cleaning function and all
25:12 data cleaning tasks should now be done
25:14 with power query because we can automate
25:16 those laborious tasks making it much
25:18 more efficient the Len and is blank
25:22 functions are typically used to validate
25:24 data and this can also be automated with
25:26 power query
25:28 concat or the older concatenate function
25:31 joins text together from multiple cells
25:34 now we don't really need this function
25:35 CU we can simply join them together with
25:38 the Ampersand so here I can reference
25:40 two cells put an ampersand in between
25:43 and Returns the text string
25:45 abc123 you can see the formula in column
25:48 s alternatively we could use power query
25:51 to join text from multiple columns the
25:54 days function calculates the number of
25:56 days between two dates and this function
25:58 also isn't required because subtracting
26:00 one date from another date is as simple
26:03 as referencing the cells and putting a
26:04 minus sign between them and there we get
26:07 five days and just to prove it let's use
26:10 the days function so the end date and
26:14 the start date close parentheses we get
26:16 the same result we can also do this in
26:19 power query as you probably gathered
26:22 power query is also an essential tool
26:24 for data analysts if you'd like to learn
26:27 more about power query check out my
26:29 introduction video and my course there
26:32 are links to both in the video
26:34 description and with that I hope you
26:36 found this tutorial useful you can
