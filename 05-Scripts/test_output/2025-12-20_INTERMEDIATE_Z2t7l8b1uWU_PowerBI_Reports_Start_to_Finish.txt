0:00 in this video I'm going to teach you step by step how to build the power VI reports you see behind me you can
0:07 download the files from the link in the video description so you can have a go yourself now if the pace is too fast
0:13 click on the Cog icon in the bottom right of the video and you can alter the speed settings and of course you can
0:19 pause and Rewind and watch as many times as you like okay let's get
0:25 started first I want to give you a very quick overview of what powerbi is it's a
0:31 business Analytics tool for visualizing and sharing insights we can get data
0:36 from hundreds of sources using the same power query tool that's available in Excel we then model the data with the
0:43 same power pivot tool that's also available in Excel and from there we create compelling interactive reports
0:49 and dashboards and collaborate and share them with people inside and outside of our organization we can set them up to
0:56 automatically refresh so there's no further maintenance require required now there are two main powerbi tools we use
1:03 the free powerbi desktop tool to get data model it and create the reports we
1:09 then publish our reports to the online powerbi service where we can collaborate and share them with our audience now the
1:16 data I'll be working with is 12 months worth of budget and forecast data and 6
1:21 months worth of actual data for the IT department of a global company and this is a modified data set from obvian the
1:29 for C budget and actual data is stored in CSV files that have been exported
1:34 from an accounting system and they're saved on my PC you can see the files contain records by date Department cost
1:42 element country and the amount and these are my fact tables I also have an Excel
1:49 file containing Dimension tables that contain further groupings for the cost element country and it departments each
1:56 table is named and these names will also be the names of of the tables when I import them into powerbi now I'll be
2:03 comparing performance against budget or plan if you prefer to call it that and
2:08 because these are costs an adverse variance will be when actual or forecasted costs are higher than budget
2:16 now for those statisticians who might be thinking that variance is the wrong term to use here I just want to clarify that
2:23 this is a term accountants use to refer to the difference between a budgeted value and the actual value okay I'll
2:30 switch over to powerbi and we'll get started powerbi desktop is the free
2:35 modeling tool available for Windows for authoring your powerbi reports it uses
2:41 the same power query and power pivot tools that we have in Excel so if you're familiar with these tools then you're
2:46 off to a head start here the power query tools are on the Home tab of the ribbon And for those not familiar with power
2:53 query this is the get and transform data tool built into both Excel and powerbi
2:59 IT enables you to get data from a huge range of sources and clean and transform it before loading it to the power pivot
3:06 model now my Dimension tables are in an Excel file so I'll grab them first we'll
3:13 connect all I need to do is browse to the file location select it and click
3:19 open the Navigator shows me a list of tables and sheets in the file I want
3:24 these three tables so I'll check each one in the right hand side we get a preview of the data so you can check
3:30 that it's what you're expecting and if I need to I can click the transform data
3:35 button to clean the data before loading it however in this case I know the data is ready so I'm going to click load and
3:42 powerbi is going to load that data into the power pivot
3:48 model we can now see the tables in the field pane ready for me to build my visuals but first I need to get the rest
3:54 of the data I'll grab the CSV files for budget and forecast
4:00 there's budget I get a preview of the data and if I need to I can clean the data by
4:07 clicking transform at this screen we can see that power query has detected the file origin but we can choose a
4:13 different one it's also detected the delimiter and it's based that on the first 200 rows and again we can choose a
4:20 different option here I'm happy with these options so I'm going to leave them as is I can clean the data by clicking
4:26 transform data but I know this data is ready to go so I'll click
4:33 load let's do the same for the forecast and we'll load it straight in
4:41 next I need to get the actuals now each month's data is in a separate file and
4:46 you can see a list of them here so I need to consolidate them into a single table I'm going to just copy the address
4:52 for the folder path and in powerbi I need to get data and then more and here
4:59 here I want to get data from a folder click connect now I can browse to the file
5:05 location but remember I've already copied it so I'm just going to contrl + V to paste it in click
5:12 okay Power queries show me a list of the files in that folder and some metadata
5:18 about those files I'm going to combine and transform data so that you can see the power query
5:24 editor similar to the CSV file we get a preview it's detected the file F origin
5:30 the delimiter and it's based that on the first 200 rows of the first file but we can choose a different one here the
5:37 first file's fine for this example I'm going to click okay Power query opens in a separate
5:44 window and here I can clean and transform the data before loading it to my model on the left you can see the
5:50 list of queries I've created so far the helper queries at the top are automatically created by power query for
5:57 me when I combined the C CSV files for the actuals data on the right is the
6:03 list of steps in the select a query which we can see here is actuals now I
6:08 don't need the first column in this table it contains the file name now sometimes this column can be handy if
6:14 you need to extract information from the file name like maybe the date but I already have a date column so I'm just
6:20 going to hit the delete key and we'll get rid of that column now if I wanted to filter out any data for example if I
6:27 only wanted to analyze data for the United States I could deselect everything and then just select USA and
6:34 that would filter the data before loading it to my data model and that's important because you don't want to be bringing in data that you're not going
6:40 to use it's just going to make your file bigger than it needs to be now I want all of the countries so I'm just going
6:46 to cancel that now there's a whole load of easy to use tools for cleaning and
6:52 transforming data available in the ribbon many of which I cover in my introduction to power query video so I
6:59 won't cover them again here but there's a link to that video in the video description okay I'm ready to load this
7:06 data to my power pivot data model in powerbi so on the Home tab I can simply
7:11 hit close and apply you can see in the fill pane that
7:17 I now have all my data ready to work with but first I need to make sure the relationships between the tables are set
7:23 up correctly and I like to do this in the model view I'll rearrange the tables
7:29 so that my fact tables are at the bottom and my Dimension tables are at the
7:35 top this way I can easily see the filter Direction arrows on the relationship connector lines all flow down from the
7:42 dimension tables to the fact tables hovering over a connector line highlights the related fields now these
7:49 relationships were automatically set up for me when I loaded the tables to the model but if required I can double click
7:55 the line and open the edit relationship dialogue box or I can make make changes I'm happy with this one so I'll leave it
8:02 as is now one thing I notice here is the Department's table only has one
8:07 relationship with the actual table but it's missing relationships between the budget and forecast and that's probably
8:14 because the column name in the budget and forecast tables is spelled slightly differently and that's fine I can create
8:21 those relationships now just left click and drag and release it on top of the field that it corresponds with and we'll
8:28 do the same for forecast and now our relationships are all set up now the last table I need is
8:36 a calendar table and this isn't strictly required for every model but because I
8:41 have three fact tables and I want to visualize data from each table in a single visual I need a dedicated
8:48 Dimension table that contains a list of dates one for every day of the calendar or fiscal years that I want to report on
8:55 now I can create this table in power query or in power V I can use the calendar or calendar Auto Dax functions
9:03 by the way these functions aren't available in power pivot in Excel so to create a table from a function I'm going
9:10 to go to the data View and then on the table tools tab I can choose new
9:16 table here I just need to give my table a name which will be calendar and I'm
9:21 going to use the calendar Auto function now this function bases the
9:26 start and end dates on the minimum and Ma maximum dates across your entire model except for dates that are
9:32 generated by calculated columns or tables or measures and it returns a table with a column of dates one for
9:39 each day in the date range if you want a table based on a fiscal period you can
9:45 specify the start month number for your fiscal year now my fiscal year starts in January so I can leave this blank but if
9:51 yours started in July then you type in a seven so I'll delete that and we'll press enter to create the calendar table
9:59 table now the calendar Auto function always starts with the first day of the
10:04 calendar year or fiscal year and it ends at the last day of the calendar year or
10:10 fiscal year and obviously if your data spans multiple years then it's going to start at the first day of the first year
10:17 and end at the last day of the last year in your data set now word of warning my
10:23 model only has dates from the 1st of January to the 31st of December 2020 so
10:28 this function will work fine for me but if your model contains dates of birth or other dates outside the range that you
10:34 want to report on then you'd be better of using the calendar function because this allows you to specify a start and
10:41 end date so now that I have my calendar Dimension table I need to create
10:47 relationships between the fact tables let's move it down
10:52 here and we'll left click and drag each of the date
10:57 fields up up to the calendar Dimension
11:03 field now before I build the visuals I want to set some formatting and I like
11:08 to do this in the data view so for example my actual column I want to set
11:14 that so that it has a comma separator let's repeat that for the
11:20 budget and for the forecast that way the formatting will
11:26 automatically feed through to my visuals I won't have to manually do it again for each one the other thing I want to do is
11:33 set the data category for my country fields and this is just going to help powerbi recognize that this data is a
11:40 country so that when I plot it in a map chart it's going to know what to do with
11:47 it so we got one more here and then finally country in the regions
11:54 table notice that I now have an icon beside each of those country fields
12:00 okay I'm ready to start building my visuals let's go to the report view now in powerbi desktop we can use the
12:07 built-in AI to ask a question of our data for example let's say I wanted to
12:13 see the actual year-to date versus the fouryear budget displayed in a gauge
12:18 chart and if I'm happy with what the Q&A tool returns I can commit that as a
12:23 standard visual I'll make it a little bit smaller and I'll move it down the
12:29 other thing I want to do is in the formatting I want to edit the title so we'll just say actual year to date
12:36 versus full year budget and with that I've created my first visual without
12:42 even needing to know how to use powerbi now you can also insert visuals
12:47 by simply selecting the visual type from the gallery here the next one I want is kpi so let's select that and then all I
12:55 need to do is Select fields from my field list and not notice I've just checked the date field and it's
13:01 automatically detected that it's probably going to go on the trend axis because it's a date field the indicator
13:08 will be the forecast and the target will be the
13:13 budget let's move it down the bottom that's where it's going to live now I need to make some changes in the
13:18 settings for the kpi because it's assumed that a positive variance is good but remember these are costs so when
13:25 costs are higher than budget that's certainly not good we can do this in the settings so under goals at the bottom I
13:34 want distance Direction decreasing is positive and in the color coding I want
13:40 low is good now the numbers displayed in the kpi are those of the last period in
13:45 the data in this case this is December's variance and the eror chart behind
13:51 represents the variance trend for the whole year the next visual I want is the
13:56 line chart so let's move this over here we'll make it a bit wider so this one I
14:03 want again the date for the AIS I don't want it down to the day level of detail
14:08 month is enough and I want the actual budget and
14:15 forast let's drill down on the data until we get to month level okay let's
14:20 make some formatting changes here so in the X AIS I don't need the
14:27 title I think it's explanatory that those are months likewise for the Y AIS we'll turn the title
14:34 off and then I'll turn the title of altogether I think this chart is fairly
14:39 self-explanatory doesn't need a title because the Legends are explaining what the data represents now the next visual
14:46 shows the running total so I need to write some measures using the power pivot formula language called Dax I need
14:53 three running total measures one for actuals one for budget and one for forecast we'll do the actual one first
15:00 click on the ellipses and select new measure and the formula Bar opens ready
15:06 for me to enter my measure so this one will be called actual RT RT for running total we'll use the calculate function
15:14 to filter the data we want to sum the actuals and filter all selected dates in
15:20 the calendar table where dates are is on or after the max date in the actual table
15:28 and the Sorting direction to calculate the running total is descending so all I need to do is hit the check mark and if
15:36 you look at the field list you can see I now have a new field in the Axel table
15:41 and notice the icon is the calculator and this indicates that this is an explicit measure meaning a measure that
15:48 I've written myself with a Dax formula now all I need to do is rinse and repeat this formula for the other table so I'm
15:55 just going to highlight it and contrl C to copy and then we'll add the budget
16:02 one and I just need to change where it says actual to budget and lastly another one for
16:14 forecast and I'm ready to insert the visual so this is going to be an area chart let's bring it down
16:20 here and we'll line it up so it's the same size as the line chart Above So
16:27 this one's going to have the actual running total the budget running total and the forecast running total and we
16:34 need to see that across dates let's drill down let's do some tidying up in the
16:41 formatting I don't need the access titles again I think it's self-explanatory so let's turn them
16:50 off and for the title itself I'll just change this to say running
16:56 total now this title is a bit bold with the black font so let's tone it down
17:01 with the shade of gray and we'll make it a little smaller okay for the next visual I need
17:08 some more measures but this time I'm going to have powerbi write them for me I need to calculate the budget versus
17:14 forecast and the budget versus forecast percentage difference so from the ellipses beside budget I want new quick
17:23 measure in the dialogue box I can choose the type of calculation so here here I want to do a subtraction the base value
17:31 is going to be the budget and the value to subtract is the
17:36 forecast I'll click okay and if you look in the formula bar
17:42 you can see powerbi has written the formula for me so let's just change this to say budget V forecast press enter to
17:50 commit that and you can see again it's in the field list let's make that a bit wider and I need one more which is the
17:57 budget V forecast C percent so we'll do another quick measure this one is going to be percentage difference the base
18:04 field is the forecast and the value to compare is the
18:12 budget and click okay and there it is in the field list if I click on it you can see the formula
18:19 that powerbi has written for me it's a little more complicated than the last one let's give it a better name and now
18:26 I'm ready to build the next visual so this one is going to be a clustered column and line combo chart there it is
18:34 there bring it down here below the other charts it's going to be the same width
18:40 and this one is going to have the date in the shared access now I don't want
18:46 this one to use the default hierarchy I just want it to use the date field and
18:52 then I'm going to have column values are the budget V forecast and the line
18:57 values are the budget V forecast percent let's do some formatting I'm going to turn off the title for the X AIS and in
19:05 the Y AIS I want to turn on the secondary axis label so we're going to
19:11 show secondary axis and I want to also show the title for that secondary
19:18 axis we'll keep scrolling down here I want to turn the title off and we're
19:24 done next I'm going to use the clustered bar chart so let's add one of those
19:29 they're going to fill this space over here there's going to be three of these charts so once I build one I can copy it
19:36 let's tidy up this list I'm just going to clap some all all right this one is
19:41 going to use region in the axis and then the budget V forecast percent in the
19:47 values I want to sort this in ascending order we'll do some
19:53 formatting I'm going to turn off the title for the Y AIS
19:59 and in the x axis I want to turn off the title and I want to turn off the
20:05 AIS because I'm going to add data labels and for the data colors I'd like
20:12 to color code the negative values so let's go in and we'll do some conditional formatting click the
20:18 function icon for data colors so this is going to be formatted by rules based on
20:26 the budget V forecast percent so where the value is greater than or equal to 0% and less than or equal to0
20:34 number I'm going to give it a shade of red we'll add a new rule for the positive values so where the value is
20:41 greater than or equal to zero number less than or equal to
20:47 100% it'll get a shade of gray we'll give it a slightly darker shade I'll click okay and now you can see my visual
20:55 has the negative values colorcoded in a shade of red reddish orange and the positive in Gray let's also make some
21:04 changes to the title because it's a bit bold so let's change the font color to a
21:09 shade of gray and we'll make it a bit smaller and let's abbreviate this so it
21:15 just be budget b forecast percent it's obvious it's by region we don't need to
21:21 point that out as well in the title all right so this visual is done with it
21:26 selected I'm going to control C to cop copy crl + V to paste I'm just going to move it down and we'll modify this one
21:32 so the next one is using the cost elements so let's add that to the fields
21:39 so I want the cost element group I'm going to add it to the axis and then I'm going to delete region and that way my
21:45 conditional formatting has carried over I don't need to reapply it so let's copy
21:51 this one contrl V to paste and we might make this one a bit
21:56 smaller because it hasn't got as many items in the vertical axis as these two
22:01 do so these ones need a bit more space and this one's going to be by it area so
22:07 in departments let's add it to the axis and then delete cost element group the
22:12 next thing I want to do is add a slicer for the region and that's this icon here
22:18 we'll simply check the region box now by default it gives us a
22:25 checklist but I want a drop down it just takes up less space so I can squish it down in there now because my actuals
22:31 only span so many months I'd like a card in the top left just calling out what
22:37 the period is year to date that this report is based on so you can do that adding a card visual which is this one
22:44 here now I need to add a measure for this so let's add one to the actual
22:49 table this is going to be called year to date month so I'm using the format function
22:57 to format the maximum date in the actual table and I'm formatting it with mmm y y
23:04 y y and I'm concatenating year to date to the end so press enter let's add that to the
23:12 visual now it's a little bit big so let's go and format it I'll turn the category off and in the data label let's
23:20 reduce the size of it down to about 38 what I want it to do is spit on one
23:26 line so actually let's go bit smaller okay there we go so this report is done
23:33 you'll notice I've lost my actual line in this line chart it seems to be a bit
23:38 of a bug in my version of pobi at the moment so if I remove it and add it back
23:43 in it comes back now the next thing I want to do is change the color theme
23:48 you'll find this on The View tab of the ribbon in the gallery here we can choose from a different theme or we can browse
23:55 for themes that we may already have on our PC we can look for new themes in the public theme gallery or we can customize
24:03 the current theme now I've already created a theme so let's browse to it it's here it's called solar M and
24:11 it's a Json file so let's load that the theme was imported and you can see it's
24:16 changed the colors in all of my visuals and again the pesky line chart has lost
24:22 its actual value okay now this one down here I'm going to make some changes to
24:28 the colors just to differentiate them from the actual figures and the budget figures because this is budget V
24:34 forecast and budget V forecast percent these aren't actuals which are pink up here so I want to make sure that they're
24:40 different so let's go and change that we'll make the budget V forecast percent line this dark purple and this one here
24:49 this shade I'll give this sheet a name we'll call it headline because it gives
24:54 an overview of the it spend across all areas of the business so now that my
24:59 first report is ready I can use the built-in interactive features to cross filter and highlight the data and
25:06 personally I think this is one of the most amazing features in powerbi if you want to understand the
25:13 movement from one period to the next powerbi Pro and premium users can rightclick and use the analyze tool to
25:21 explain the increase or decrease here it gives me a waterfall
25:27 chart showing the components contributing to the change by cost element and if I scroll down I've got
25:34 some different charts this one's by cost element group it Department department
25:40 manager it area and so on and Below each chart I can choose a different type of
25:46 chart so the default is the waterfall but we can look at it based on a scatter chart stacked column and even a ribbon
25:55 chart now this feature is still in prev so it may look different when you come to try it out let's move on I'll add
26:02 another sheet for my regions report the first visual here is a
26:07 clustered bar chart so let's add that this one is going to be by region and I
26:13 want the actuals and the budget let's do some formatting I'm going to turn off the
26:20 title for the Y AIS it's fairly self-explanatory I'm going to do the
26:25 same for the x axis and I'm going to turn the x-axis off all together because
26:31 I'm going to add data labels let's change the data colors make the budget
26:37 the gray shade which is in keeping with the visuals on the headline sheet so I'll make this a little
26:43 bigger now the next visual is actually this one here from the headline figure
26:49 sheet so I'm just going to contrl C to copy and I'm going to paste it in here let's bring it
26:55 over and we'll make it the same height next I'm going to add some Matrix tables
27:01 now these are a bit like pivot tables that we have in Excel so here I want it
27:06 area in the rows regions in the columns and the values are going to be the budget V
27:14 forecast the formatting I'm going to apply some conditional formatting I'd like to see icons let's go into the
27:21 advanc controls so the rules are based on the budget V forecast what I want to do is just highlight Nega negative
27:28 variances with a red dot and positive with a Green Dot so we'll change the rules down here if a value is greater
27:34 than or equal to 0% and is less than Z
27:40 number then this is going to be negative so let's give it a red dot and if the
27:45 value is greater than or equal to zero number and less than or equal to 100%
27:53 then that's going to get a Green Dot that means we don't need this rule I'll click okay and now we have our
28:00 conditional formatting set so let me copy this table and paste it in again
28:06 I'll drag it down below I'm just going to modify it and this time instead of it
28:13 area I want cost element group so I'm just going to drag the cost element into
28:18 the rows and then delete the it area that way my conditional formatting stays
28:23 intact let's give it a bit more space and then we'll make this one the same size and let's make this column wider so
28:32 that they're lined up closer together and we can give Europe's column
28:38 a little bit more space as well okay that will do I think you get the idea
28:43 with the formatting all right the next visual is going to be this filled map so
28:49 we'll pop it up here let's give it a bit more space and here I want to look at the
28:55 actual costs by country now at the moment everything's the same shade so
29:01 let's go in and give our data colors some conditional formatting so here we
29:07 want the color scale based on the sum of actual the lowest value will give it this shade of purple and the highest
29:13 value will give it this darker shade so I'll click okay and now we get a better
29:18 feel for the size of the data with the USA being by far the highest values and
29:26 the last visual for this report page is a scatter chart so let's pop it in the space here this one we want the country
29:34 in the legend and then we want budget V forecast in the xais and budget V
29:40 forecast percent in the Y AIS and for the bubble size we'll use the
29:45 forecast so from the scatter plot here we can see that USA has the largest cost
29:51 by far and while it's nearly 1.7 million over budget that's less than 1% over so
29:58 it's not doing too badly in the scheme of things whereas down here we've got Spain that's 177% over budget with a
30:05 300,000 overspend right let's edit this visuals title we'll just call it budget V
30:13 forecast and let's tone down the color we'll give it a shade of gray while I'm here let's fix this one so that it's
30:21 title is also not so black okay the last visual I want to
30:27 show you is called the decomposition tree it's this icon here in the visual
30:32 Gallery let's make it really big it needs lots of Rim now the decomposition tree is available to powerbi Pro and
30:39 premium users and it enables you to conduct root cause analyses for example we might want to understand the factors
30:46 contributing to the adverse variance to budget by visualizing data across multiple Dimensions powerbi
30:53 automatically Aggregates the data so we can drill down into dimension in any
30:58 order I can click on the plus beside budget V forecast and I can use Pal's AI
31:05 to find the biggest contributor to the negative variance by choosing low value
31:11 now by default it sorts in descending order but since I'm interested in negative variances I want to sort in
31:18 ascending order here I can see the administrative cost element is the biggest contributor and again we can
31:24 continue to use the AI to drill down and find the next low value so we can see
31:31 USA and let's continue in the cost month group administrative as you'd expect
31:37 because the cost element is Administrative and lastly into the department now the color dotted line
31:45 indicates I've used the powerbi AI to find the next level I can click on
31:50 external labor and the decomposition tree updates to show me the factors contributing to this variance and I can
31:57 continue to choose different paths to analyze and understand the causes of the
32:03 variance let's delete these and I'll choose the fields myself
32:11 so this time I want to see by cost element group and then we'll drill into
32:17 administrative into the cost element and then I want to know which
32:24 country and obviously it's returning the same results as you'd expect it would
32:29 but I'm seeing it in the order that I've specified so again I can choose labor and this time I can say well there's a
32:36 positive variance in internal labor let's have a look at that I can see USA is contributing to the positive variance
32:42 for internal labor but it's also contributing to the negative variance for external labor so as you can see the
32:49 decomposition tree is an amazing tool for understanding contributing factors to your business
32:55 performance so now that my reports are built it's time to publish them to the powerbi service the powerbi service is a
33:03 web-based online portal for publishing and securely sharing your powerbi
33:08 reports and dashboards I'm going to save my file and then on the Home tab I can
33:14 click publish I can choose the workspace I'm going to put it in this one called
33:21 demos it's all done so now I can switch over to powerbi and we can view the
33:27 Reports online so here I am in my web browser
33:32 I'm in my Demo's workspace and if I scroll down you can see I now have a data set for it spend and I have reports
33:40 for it spend so let's take a look at those it's opened up on the last report
33:46 I had let's go to the headline here I can interact with the
33:51 reports in the powerbi service just like I can using powerbi desktop you can see the CR cross filtering and highlighting
33:58 all works in exactly the same way if I want to focus in on a specific
34:04 visual I can go into Focus mode and that will open it in a larger window on the
34:10 right I have the filters pane or I can continue to filter down into this data
34:16 if we go back to report view you'll notice the filters pane is available here as well so as a user I can continue
34:23 to add filters but any filters I add here won't be saved I can also click on
34:29 the ellipses and show this as a table and then I get the chart at the top and
34:34 below I get the actual values that are displayed in that chart and just like in powerbi desktop
34:42 Pro and premium users can use the analyze tool to understand what the cause is of any increases or
34:49 decreases again we're going to get the waterfall charts that help us understand that movement from one period to the
34:56 next now if you want to provide a high level view of your data and restrict users
35:02 ability to add more filters or export the data then you can create a dashboard
35:08 on the ellipses here I can pin this whole visual to a dashboard it's going to pin the live page and that means any
35:15 changes to the report will be visible in the dashboard as well so I can create a new dashboard we'll call it it spend and
35:23 Pin live and then if I scroll up and see it's created the dashboard if we look on
35:30 the left hand side I can see it here I can navigate to it notice here we get a more streamlined
35:36 view there's no filters options on the right hand side but the cross filtering and highlighting works in the same way
35:44 there's no rightclick menu so there's no option to analyze but at the top we can
35:49 ask questions about our data using the built-in Q&A there's a list of suggested
35:56 questions to choose from or you can ask your own for example let's say I wanted to know infrastructure forecast by
36:03 department manager or even infrastructure budget V forecast by
36:08 department manager and if I like this visual I can pin it to my dashboard as well let's go
36:15 back to the reports and we'll talk about sharing palbi pro and premium users have
36:21 the option to share we can click on report and in the right hand side we get the sharing pane where we can enter the
36:28 email addresses of those users that I want to share my report with the nice thing about sharing using the powerbi
36:35 service is that your data is secure you can modify the settings below to restrict what recipients can do and
36:42 those you've shared your reports with must log into their own powerbi account to view them of course if your data
36:48 isn't confidential then you can choose to embed the report either in SharePoint
36:54 online a website or portal like an internet or even just to a public
37:00 website now there's a lot more to the powerbi service and sharing reports and
37:05 dashboards than I can cover in this video but hopefully you can see that powerbi gives you far more control over
37:11 who can see and share your reports than you can achieve with Excel for example so the next thing you're going to want
37:18 to do is update your reports and the procedure for refreshing the data depends on the location of your Source
37:25 data and again that's vast topic so I can't cover everything in this video I've set up a personal Gateway between
37:32 my PC and the powerbi service which enables powerbi to securely communicate
37:37 with my PC to get new data so all I need to do is add the July data to my folder
37:43 on my PC so let's go and grab that I've got some July data here I'll copy it
37:50 let's pop it in this folder here so you can see there's now a new file let's go
37:56 back to the powerbi service down in the data sets all I need to do is click on
38:01 it spend and then choose refresh now so the data's been refreshed but my report
38:08 doesn't reflect it yet all I need to do here is refresh the report clicking the
38:13 refresh icon here and if you keep an eye on the area chart you'll see that July data is added
38:22 we can see the tool tip shows me that I now have an actual for July and if we go and have a look at the
38:29 dashboard you'll see that it also contains the July data and that means those you've shared your dashboards and
38:35 reports with will also see that updated data now I've triggered the refresh
38:41 manually here but you can schedule automatic refreshes to run at specific
38:46 times so if we look at the data set you can see there I have the option to schedule a
38:52 refresh and in here I can set the frequency now before we wrap up there are some things I want to point out and
38:59 reiterate the visualizations and the related data set have been published to
39:04 the cloud and they reside in the secure powerbi service now this may be an issue
39:09 for some companies so I cover the Alternatives in my course if you want to share your reports and dashboards you
39:17 and those you share them with require a powerbi pro license which is currently
39:22 US $10 per person when you share a dashboard those you share it with have
39:27 access to the same reports and underlying data but they can't save any changes unless you allow them to this
39:35 access to the underlying data allows them to dig into the data and find answers to their own questions now if
39:42 you want to restrict access to data based on a user's role for example you
39:47 want each regional manager to only see their region then you need to use Rowl security which I also cover in detail in
39:54 my powerbi course the other thing to bear in mind for Excel users is that the same power quy and power pivot tools we
40:02 have in Excel are used in powerbi so if you already know these tools then you're
40:07 off to a head start but if you're one of the millions of users who still has a version of excel that's not compatible
40:13 with these tools then you don't have to miss out any longer since they come free with the powerbi desktop application so
40:21 now you can get your power query and power pivot skills up to speed and when your company eventually upgrades your
40:27 version of excel you'll be way ahead of the curve well I hope you're excited to give palvi a go if you'd like to get up
40:35 to speed with powerbi power query and power pivot please consider my courses
40:40 you'll find a link to them in the video description and if you'd like to have a go at building these reports yourself
40:46 you can download the files for this lesson from the link here if you like this video please give it a thumbs up
40:53 and subscribe to my channel for more and why not share it with your friends friends who might also find it useful
40:58 thanks for [Music]
