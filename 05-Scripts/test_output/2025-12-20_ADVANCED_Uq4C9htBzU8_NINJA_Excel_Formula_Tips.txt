0:00 formulas are the most important Excel
0:03 skill you can Master but when you start
0:05 nesting functions things can quickly get
0:08 out of hand in this lesson I'm going to
0:10 cover some little known Excel formula
0:13 writing tips tricks and tools that will
0:15 give you Ninja level skills and enable
0:18 you to decipher any formula even ones
0:21 you haven't written yourself when you
0:23 first learn to write formulas you'll
0:25 typically use regular cell references
0:27 like we see here with D2 to d26 and C2
0:30 to c26 and this is okay except when it
0:34 comes time to interpreting the formula
0:35 at a later date because it's just not
0:37 easy to figure out what that formula is
0:39 doing you need to locate the cells being
0:42 referenced by going back and forth
0:44 between the data and the formula to try
0:47 and understand what's going on however
0:50 if we format The Source data that we're
0:52 referencing in an Excel table the
0:55 formula can be understood right from
0:57 within the cell now we can use the
0:59 keyboard shortcut contrl T to format the
1:02 data in a table my data has headers so
1:04 I'll click okay here and if we go to the
1:07 table design tab you can see the tables
1:08 been given the name table two we can
1:10 give it a more useful name I'll call it
1:12 sales data just simply type it in the
1:15 table name
1:16 field and then when we write our
1:18 formulas we can use the mouse to
1:20 reference the data so I want to look up
1:21 the sales column just positioning the
1:23 mouse above the column header when I
1:25 click it selects the whole column and
1:28 you can see in the formula bar completed
1:30 the structured reference which comprises
1:32 of the table name and the column name so
1:35 I want to index the sales and find a
1:37 match for socks and another way we can
1:40 write the formula is by typing the table
1:41 and column names in the formula so I
1:44 want sales data and there it is there
1:46 the intell ense has prompted me tab to
1:49 select it and it's in the column product
1:52 close my square brackets and then I want
1:55 an exact match so that's zero close
1:57 match close index and press enter now I
2:01 think you'll agree that this is much
2:03 clearer than the regular cell
2:06 references another benefit of using
2:09 Excel tables is that the structured
2:11 references automatically include any new
2:13 data added to the table so there's no
2:16 need to edit formulas to pick up new
2:18 cells now I can't recommend Excel tables
2:21 enough automatic updating and structured
2:24 references are just a couple of the
2:25 benefits of using tables you can see
2:28 them all in my Excel tables course
2:30 linked to in the video
2:32 description now if you can't or don't
2:34 want to format your data in an Excel
2:35 table well you must be crazy but if you
2:38 insist then another option is to Define
2:41 names for the ranges you need to
2:42 reference in your formulas or if you're
2:45 expecting your data to grow then you
2:47 should use Dynamic named ranges there
2:50 are links in the video description to
2:51 tutorials on these
2:56 topics now when you start nesting
2:59 functions in inside one another it's a
3:01 good idea to wrap the individual
3:02 components onto separate lines so that
3:05 it's easy to read we can do this in the
3:08 formula bar I'll just drag it down to
3:10 make it a bit wider place your cursor
3:12 where you want the line break and then
3:14 alt and enter to wrap it onto the next
3:17 line we can do that at each step in the
3:21 formula that's just going to make it
3:23 easier to see the individual components
3:25 and understand what's going on
3:28 alternatively if you have Excel 2013 or
3:31 later you can use the advanced formula
3:33 environment so let's do that we'll copy
3:36 the formula here and then on the hom tab
3:38 of the ribbon you'll find the advanced
3:40 formula environment if it's not there
3:42 I'll show you how to get it in a moment
3:44 it opens a pane on the right hand side
3:46 clicking on the plus we get to name our
3:49 new formula I'm just going to call it
3:51 test because this is just temporary and
3:53 then in the refer two paste in your
3:54 formula make sure you delete the equals
3:57 at the beginning cuz there's already one
3:59 here
4:00 and then click add and you can see it
4:02 automatically formats the formula for
4:04 you all you need to do then is copy it
4:08 and go back to the formula bar and paste
4:10 it in and now I have my nicely formatted
4:13 formula unfortunately in the formula bar
4:15 it doesn't retain the nice color
4:17 formatting that we get in the advanced
4:19 formula environment alternatively you
4:22 can Define the formula as a name if you
4:24 do that you'll want to give it a proper
4:26 name and then click on the Sync icon
4:29 here to save it to the name manager and
4:32 you can then reference that formula as a
4:34 name now if you don't have the advanced
4:36 formula environment you can get it by
4:38 inserting it via the insert Tab and then
4:41 add-ins get addins and then type in the
4:44 search bar Advanced formula environment
4:47 select it from the list here and click
4:49 add it'll then be available on your Home
4:52 tab on the far
4:58 right now we should try and avoid hard
5:00 keyed values in formulas like we did in
5:03 the previous examples where the lookup
5:05 value socks is hard keyed instead it's
5:08 better to place the value in a cell and
5:10 then reference that cell from your
5:12 formulas then if you need to update it
5:15 you simply edit that one cell and it's
5:17 going to update all the
5:19 formulas even better is to give this
5:21 cell a name we can do that via the name
5:23 box up here so let's just call this prod
5:26 and then in our
5:28 formulas we can w reference
5:30 prod there it is in the
5:33 list instead of the cell reference which
5:36 makes the formula much easier to read
5:39 alternatively you could Define the
5:41 constant in a name so via the formulas
5:44 tab Define name we'll call it products
5:47 just to differentiate it and in here
5:49 we're going to enter the name and click
5:53 okay and now instead of prod let's
5:56 reference products our new defined name
6:00 and you can see it's now ignoring this
6:02 value and referencing socks again then
6:05 if we need to update that we can just go
6:07 into the formulas Tab and into the name
6:10 manager and under products instead of
6:12 socks we might want Wheels click the
6:16 check mark and close and you can see
6:19 it's now updated so it's a very
6:21 efficient way to manage constants in
6:23 formulas because you only need to update
6:26 it in one place it then feeds through to
6:28 all formulas that use that
6:32 name if you've ever experienced Exel not
6:35 letting you enter a formula because
6:37 you're missing a closing parenthesis or
6:39 you just can't see where it should go
6:41 then you'll find these formula
6:42 navigating tips helpful for identifying
6:45 where each component of the formula
6:47 starts and ends when you're in edit mode
6:50 inside a formula either in the formula
6:52 bar or in the cell itself the tool tip
6:55 often gets in the way we can left click
6:57 and drag it once we get our foreheaded
6:59 Arrow by hovering over the edge of the
7:01 tool tip and we can just move it out of
7:04 the way we can use the tool tip to
7:06 navigate through the formula using the
7:08 hyperlinks so as I hover my mouse I get
7:11 the blue hyperlink and I can click on
7:13 that to select that part of the formula
7:16 the Bold argument in the tool tip
7:18 indicates the current location of the
7:19 cursor or the selected component of the
7:22 formula if we look at match and I jumped
7:25 to match type you can see that after the
7:27 last argument I should have for closing
7:29 bracket or parenthesis we can see one
7:32 here for the match functions match type
7:34 argument and if I go back to index and
7:37 click on the last argument that's
7:39 populated you can see we don't have a
7:41 column number cuz it's not offering me a
7:43 hyperlink so row number is my last
7:44 argument and I can see I should
7:46 therefore have a closing parenthesis
7:49 after that and I do now if you can't
7:52 remember how a function works you can
7:54 click on the function icon up in the
7:56 formula bar and it'll open the function
7:58 wizard
7:59 the function wizard dialog box contains
8:01 more information about the function and
8:04 each
8:08 argument you may have managed to get
8:10 Excel to accept your formula but perhaps
8:12 it's not returning the correct results
8:15 here we have a couple of tools that will
8:16 help identify where the problem is we
8:19 can evaluate components of the formula
8:22 either in the cell in edit mode or in
8:24 the formula bar let's do the formula bar
8:27 I'm going to jump to the row number
8:28 argument and then if I want to see what
8:30 that returns I can press the F9 key on
8:33 my keyboard and we can see it returns 10
8:36 I can continue selecting elements and
8:39 pressing F9 to get the results I won't
8:41 press it here because it's going to
8:43 return the whole column of sales data we
8:45 can contrl Z to undo the last element
8:47 evaluated or escape to exit and return
8:50 the formula to its prior on evaluated
8:57 State sometimes you have many nested
8:59 functions and elements and it's
9:01 difficult to tell what order Excel is
9:03 evaluating in and that's when the
9:05 evaluate formula tool is Handy it takes
9:07 you step by step through the formula in
9:10 order of evaluation displaying the
9:12 results one component at a time we'll
9:15 find it on the formulas Tab and then
9:19 evaluate
9:20 formula the next part of the formula to
9:22 be evaluated is indicated with an
9:25 underline and if the formula references
9:27 the result of another formula you can
9:29 step in and step out of the reference
9:31 formulas in this example cell C7
9:34 contains a formula so I can step into
9:36 that and now I can see the formula
9:38 contained in Cel C7 I can go ahead and
9:41 evaluate parts of that formula and then
9:44 step back out and it completes the
9:47 evaluated element and we can see the
9:49 underline indicates that that's the next
9:51 part to be evaluated I can go ahead and
9:54 click on that it returns true then it's
9:57 going to evaluate C7 again I can step in
10:00 evaluate it or step back out and
10:03 continue from there until we get the
10:05 final result it doesn't change anything
10:07 in the cell itself and we can restart if
10:10 we need to see it again now the
10:12 limitation of the evaluate formula
10:14 dialog box is that you can't make it any
10:16 bigger and often it's just too small to
10:18 display the entire formula results which
10:21 means a lot of scrolling making it
10:23 difficult to
10:24 use I hope you found this tutorial
