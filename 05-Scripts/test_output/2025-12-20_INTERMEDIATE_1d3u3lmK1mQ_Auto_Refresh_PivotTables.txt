0:00 in this tutorial we're going to look at
0:01 the options we have available to Auto
0:04 refresh pivot tables in Excel without
0:06 using VBA now the process differs
0:09 depending on whether you use power query
0:11 to get the data or not beware though
0:14 because not all pivot tables based on
0:16 power query data will Auto refresh and
0:19 I'll show you what prevents it and a
0:20 common mistake to avoid I'll also show
0:23 you the VBA method required for regular
0:25 pivot tables in this first scenario
0:28 we're going to use power query to get
0:30 the data and either load it to the power
0:32 pivot data model or direct to a pivot
0:34 table for example I'm going to grab this
0:37 data so on the data tab from sheet put
0:40 it into Power query we'll call this PQ
0:44 to PP so it's going from Power query to
0:46 power pivot and I'm going to close and
0:49 load
0:50 two and in here I just want to create a
0:52 connection and add it to the data model
0:56 so now my data is in power pivot I can
0:59 insert a pivot table from the data model
1:03 we pop it on this
1:04 worksheet and I just want to look at the
1:07 category and
1:09 sales now with the cell in the pivot
1:11 table selected open the data Tab and
1:14 then choose properties if that button
1:17 does nothing then right click on the
1:19 query in the query Pane and open
1:21 properties from there and you can see
1:24 here I have the option to refresh it as
1:26 frequently as every minute and or
1:29 refresh it when I open the file I'll
1:32 just cancel that cuz that will drive me
1:34 crazy refreshing every minute the next
1:37 example I want to show you is that in
1:39 later versions of excel you can load
1:41 direct from Power query to a pivot table
1:44 or pivot chart and this loads the data
1:46 into the pivot table cache and that
1:48 allows you to build regular pivot tables
1:50 as opposed to loading the data to the
1:52 power pivot data model so let's get the
1:55 data with power
1:57 query this is going to be power query to
2:00 pivot table and I want to close and load
2:03 to and you can see in this dialogue box
2:06 I can choose pivot table report or pivot
2:08 chart now this dialog box is only
2:11 available in later versions of excel so
2:13 if you don't see these options then you
2:15 can't activate it I'm sorry I'm going to
2:17 load it to a pivot table report and
2:19 we'll put it on a new
2:20 worksheet so again we'll look at
2:22 category
2:24 sales and then on the data tab you can
2:26 try the properties button in this case
2:28 it works notice it's opening the query
2:31 properties again I can set the refresh
2:33 interval and refresh data when opening
2:36 the
2:37 file the next scenario is where you get
2:40 data with power query and load it to a
2:42 table in the Excel file and then from
2:44 there you create a pivot table so let's
2:46 do that we'll get the data with the
2:48 power query so this is going from Power
2:50 query to a table to a pivot
2:54 table close and load two this time we're
2:58 putting it in a table file first and
3:00 we'll put it on a new
3:01 worksheet and then from here I can
3:03 summarize with pivot table so it's
3:05 reading the data in the table we'll put
3:08 it on this
3:10 sheet again sales by
3:13 category so now I have my pivot table
3:16 selected on the data tab of the ribbon
3:18 properties is grayed out but I can
3:21 rightclick on the query and open the
3:24 properties and again I've got the
3:26 refresh options however in this case
3:30 this is only going to refresh the query
3:33 which will in turn update the table but
3:35 it won't update the pivot
3:40 table now another problem with creating
3:43 pivot tables from queries loaded to
3:45 tables like this is that when you use
3:47 refresh all on the data tab to refresh
3:49 both queries and pivot tables the pivot
3:52 table refreshes before the query has had
3:54 time to load the updated data into the
3:56 table this means you have to refresh all
3:59 twice once for the queries to update the
4:01 tables and then again for the pivot
4:03 tables to get the updated data so the
4:06 bottom line is you should avoid loading
4:09 data to a table that you want to use in
4:11 a pivot table instead load it direct to
4:14 the pivot table or pivot chart if you
4:16 have that option in your version of
4:19 excel now best practice is to import
4:22 data to power pivot via power query but
4:26 since Excel allows you to import the
4:28 data direct to power pivot we'll look at
4:30 that next I have my data here I can go
4:33 to the power pivot Tab and add it
4:35 directly to the data model alternatively
4:38 I can insert a pivot table and here I
4:41 can choose to add this to the data model
4:44 let's pop the pivot table on this
4:46 worksheet and we'll bring the field list
4:49 over close to the pivot table again
4:51 we'll look at sales by category so my
4:54 data is loaded into the power pivot data
4:56 model that means this pivot table is a
4:58 power pivot pivot table table when I go
5:00 to the data Tab and open the queries and
5:03 connections you can see I've got two
5:05 here one for the data model and one for
5:08 the connection to the source data so
5:10 with the cell in the pivot table
5:12 selected I can open the properties
5:14 notice that it brings up connection
5:16 properties rather than query properties
5:19 and here I can set the refresh interval
5:21 or refresh data when opening the
5:25 file the next scenario is where you
5:27 connect a regular pivot table direct to
5:30 Source data that's external to your
5:32 pivot table file it could be another
5:34 Excel workbook CSV or text files or even
5:37 a database for example on the insert tab
5:40 I can go pivot table from external data
5:43 source and in here I can choose a
5:46 connection so I can select one of the
5:48 ones I've used before or browse to
5:51 more here I'm going to choose an access
5:54 database and I'm going to analyze the
5:56 data in the orders table put it on this
6:00 worksheet and we'll look
6:04 at ship mode and shipping amount so
6:08 there's my pivot table if we go to the
6:10 data Tab and we look at properties you
6:14 can see it brings up the connection
6:15 properties dialog box and again I can
6:17 set my refresh interval and or have it
6:20 refresh when I open the file now this
6:24 technique is only suitable for data
6:26 that's already in the perfect tabular
6:28 format as you'd find in an access
6:30 database if you need to clean and
6:32 transform your data then you should use
6:33 power query to get the data first so
6:37 that wraps up the built-in Auto refresh
6:39 options we have for pivot tables just be
6:42 careful because each time the auto
6:44 refresh triggers Excel becomes
6:46 temporarily unresponsive and it takes
6:48 Focus away from the cell or object that
6:50 you're working on and this can be super
6:52 annoying if you're entering data or
6:54 making other changes to your file when
6:56 the refresh triggers so don't get
6:58 carried away set the refresh frequency
7:00 to twoo
7:01 often now what happens if you haven't
7:05 used power query or power pivot instead
7:08 you've built a regular pivot table Based
7:10 on data in the current file as is often
7:12 the case where your Source data is
7:13 regularly updated by users entering data
7:17 well in this scenario you can use VBA to
7:19 automatically refresh pivot tables in
7:22 the file when the user moves away from
7:24 the source data sheet to any other sheet
7:26 in the file the Assumption here is that
7:28 the pivot tables would need refreshing
7:30 when that user deselects The Source data
7:32 sheet because it's possible they change
7:34 something in the source data so let's
7:37 create a pivot table from this
7:41 data we'll pop it on sheet one
7:45 here and again we'll look
7:49 at sales by category so there's our
7:52 pivot table it's connected to this
7:54 Source data sheet on this sheet here
7:56 I've got some notes which contains the
7:58 VBA code there are two pieces that you
8:00 need the first part is specific to the
8:03 sheet containing your data so I'm just
8:05 going to select and contrl C to copy the
8:07 code and then on the developer tab I can
8:10 open the Visual Basic editor or use
8:12 keyboard shortcut alt f11 now this code
8:16 goes in the module for the sheet that
8:18 contains your Source data so double
8:20 click that contrl V to paste it in let's
8:23 go back and the next piece of code
8:26 refreshes all pivot tables in the file
8:28 so control to copy that back to the
8:31 Visual Basic editor this code goes in
8:34 this workbook so I'll paste it in there
8:38 let's close the Visual Basic editor now
8:41 you need to save the file as a xlsm so
8:44 that the VBA is saved in the file so
8:46 let's do that F12 to save
8:49 as change the file type to macro enable
8:54 workbook and save now what will happen
8:57 is when I change something in here so
8:59 let's make this 5,000 so this is in the
9:01 category called components when I click
9:03 on sheet one which contains my pivot
9:05 table you see in a blink of an eye the
9:08 pivot table has
9:12 updated I hope you found these
9:14 techniques useful you can download the
