0:00 if you're new to Pivot tables you might
0:02 think they're scary or complicated so in
0:05 this video I'm going to show you how
0:07 easy pivot tables are to build now be
0:10 sure to watch to the end where I cover
0:12 the common mistakes that people make
0:14 which leads them to thinking pivot
0:16 tables are difficult here I've got some
0:19 sales data categorized by order ID
0:22 customer ID
0:25 salesperson then we have order priority
0:28 skew ship mode
0:30 order date and S amount naturally I'm
0:34 interested in analyzing these sales
0:36 amounts by the different criteria now I
0:38 could use formulas like sum ifs and
0:40 countifs but it's way quicker to use a
0:43 pivot table in other words a pivot table
0:46 is an easy way to summarize large
0:48 amounts of data now before we can create
0:51 a pivot table I want to point out the
0:54 important attributes of this data first
0:57 notice each column has a column label
1:01 and there's only one row of column
1:03 labels there aren't any merged cells or
1:06 columns without a label and the column
1:08 labels become the fields you can work
1:11 with in your pivot table the data here
1:14 is in what we call a tabular layout that
1:17 is each column contains a single type of
1:20 data and I don't have multiple columns
1:22 containing the sales amounts Broken Out
1:24 by month or salesperson for example
1:27 that's the job of the pivot table now as
1:30 I scroll down you can see I also don't
1:32 have any subtotals or grand totals or
1:36 any blank rows now I've formatted this
1:39 data in an Excel table and you can see
1:42 it's called table one and while this is
1:44 optional the benefits of this is that
1:47 when you add new data you don't need to
1:50 update the pivot table's reference to
1:52 the data because the table range
1:54 automatically grows to include it and
1:56 we'll see that in a moment all right
1:58 we're ready to insert our first pivot
2:01 table start by selecting your data or if
2:04 you have a contiguous range of data like
2:06 mine or formatted in a table just select
2:09 one cell and then Excel will be able to
2:12 find the bounds of that table if you're
2:14 new to Pivot tables you might like to
2:16 try the recommended pivot tables
2:19 available on the insert tab of the
2:21 ribbon this opens a dialogue box with
2:23 some examples based on your data in the
2:27 left you get the small thumbnails and
2:30 clicking on one gives a slightly bigger
2:31 view in the right hand pane if there's
2:34 one there that you like simply click
2:36 okay and it will be inserted on a new
2:39 worksheet alternatively you can click
2:41 blank pivot table and it will open up a
2:44 new worksheet ready for you to build a
2:46 pivot table I'm going to click cancel
2:49 and we'll use the pivot table button on
2:51 the insert Tab and this will allow me to
2:53 choose where I place the pivot table you
2:56 can see it's automatically detected my
2:59 table and it's placed the table name in
3:01 the table range field here I can choose
3:04 to put my pivot table on a new worksheet
3:06 now I recommend this but in this example
3:09 I'm going to place it on an existing
3:11 worksheet because I want to put it just
3:13 here beside the data so we can see it in
3:15 context I'll click okay and Excel has
3:19 put a placeholder in the worksheet and
3:22 on the right hand side we have the field
3:23 list I'm just going to left click and
3:26 drag it out over here so that I can zoom
3:28 in notice the field list simply contains
3:31 the column names from the source data
3:35 the bottom half of the fill pane
3:36 contains the areas in the pivot table to
3:39 build the pivot table simply left click
3:41 and drag the fields into the pivot table
3:44 areas let's say I want to summarize the
3:47 sale amount by salesperson and did you
3:50 notice there I just checked the box for
3:52 sale amount and Excel has automatically
3:55 put that in the value area it's done
3:57 that because my sale amount column has
4:00 numbers in it so it's assuming that I
4:01 want to add that up and it's assumed
4:04 correctly and with that I have my sales
4:06 amounts by
4:08 salesperson this is the equivalent of a
4:10 suth formula except I haven't had to
4:13 write any formulas the pivot table has
4:15 done all the hard work for me now let's
4:18 say I changed my mind and I want to see
4:20 the salese across the columns and the
4:22 sales broken down by date I can left
4:24 click and drag to move the salese from
4:27 the rows to the columns area and then
4:30 I'm going to drag the order date down
4:32 into the row area notice the dates have
4:35 been grouped by month and I now have a
4:37 new field called month in my field list
4:41 Excel 2016 onward does this grouping
4:44 automatically but you can change it by
4:46 the group menu just right click on one
4:49 of the date cells and then group and in
4:53 here you can see there are other
4:54 grouping options alternatively you can
4:57 ungroup by the rightclick menu as well
4:59 well I'm going to leave it as is now I
5:02 think you'll agree that so far it's been
5:04 super easy to create this summary table
5:08 and move the salesperson field from the
5:10 rows to the columns but imagine if you
5:12 created this table using formulas and
5:15 then you needed to change the layout it
5:17 would be a nightmare now another great
5:19 tool we have in pivot tables is the
5:21 ability to change the aggregation by
5:23 default it's set to sum the data but if
5:26 I right click I've got summarized value
5:29 buy and you can see some is checked but
5:32 I can also count average Max Min product
5:37 and in more options we also have count
5:40 numbers standard deviation and
5:43 variances let's take a look at counting
5:47 click okay and now it's counting the
5:49 sales amounts by sales person and month
5:53 of course most reports aren't static
5:55 you're likely to get new data that you
5:57 want to include in your pivot table
5:59 report
6:00 we can see here this one only goes up to
6:02 November on this sheet here I've got
6:04 some data for December so let me select
6:08 that I'm just going to contrl C to copy
6:10 it we'll go back to the sheet where my
6:13 source data is I'm going to go to the
6:15 very end of the table and on the next
6:17 empty row I'm going to crl +v to paste
6:20 you can see the table has expanded and
6:23 if we go to the very end of the table
6:25 you can see it's got the table icon in
6:27 the bottom right corner that's
6:29 indicating to me that my table range has
6:32 updated to include the December data and
6:35 now all I need to do is go back to my
6:37 pivot table right click and refresh and
6:41 if you watch here we're going to get new
6:43 data for
6:45 December and it's that easy and this is
6:48 because I referenced the table as the
6:51 source data for my pivot table another
6:54 thing we can do is Nest row and column
6:56 labels for example let's say we want to
6:59 see the the ship mode and Order priority
7:01 I'm just going to drag the date fields
7:04 out and then check ship mode and Order
7:08 priority and now I have the count of
7:10 sales amounts by ship mode and Order
7:13 priority and of course I can right click
7:16 and change the aggregation to average
7:18 let's say for example and now my data is
7:22 averaged and the great thing about
7:24 summarizing your data with pivot tables
7:26 aside from how quick and easy they are
7:28 to build and change
7:30 is there's no risk of formula errors can
7:33 you imagine building this with formulas
7:35 well with that said let's look at some
7:38 common reasons why people find pivot
7:40 tables
7:42 difficult the main reason for pivot
7:44 table problems is the wrong data layout
7:47 here I've got the same data but instead
7:49 of the values all in one column they're
7:52 spread across separate columns for each
7:53 month essentially this data is already
7:56 pivoted now notice there's also a column
7:59 for the grand total of the rows and if I
8:02 scroll down to the very end you can see
8:05 there's a grand total for the
8:07 columns now you can insert a pivot table
8:10 using this data format but you'll
8:13 quickly find that it doesn't work the
8:15 way you'd expect let's take a look I'm
8:17 going to insert a pivot table and we'll
8:20 place it on this worksheet here that
8:23 I've got set up the first thing you're
8:25 going to notice is in the field list we
8:28 have a separate field for every month
8:31 and the grand total so we'll go ahead
8:33 and build the same pivot table we want
8:35 it by salesperson and then we want the
8:37 sales amounts of January February March
8:39 April May June you've got to check them
8:42 all one by one which is annoying in
8:44 itself we'll just move the field list
8:46 down a little not only is it very
8:49 inefficient to build pivot tables like
8:51 this but it means you also can't use
8:53 some of the other pivot tools available
8:56 for example notice there's no grand
8:57 total for the rose now I had a grand
9:00 total in my source data so I can check
9:02 the box for that field and add it but
9:05 it's not ideal notice I also have a row
9:08 containing blank this is the grand total
9:11 Row in my source data so if we go back
9:14 and have a look at the bottom of my
9:17 table I've got a grand total row so it's
9:20 effectively double
9:22 counting my data because the sum of Bob
9:26 JN and Richard's sales is 503
9:29 47947 for January then it's counting the
9:32 grand total row and double counting it
9:35 in the pivot table grand total and the
9:38 reason it's blank is because in the
9:40 source data there's no salesperson on
9:43 the grand total row another problem is
9:47 if I want to change the aggregation to
9:49 say average I have to rightclick
9:51 summarize values by average and then I
9:53 have to do it again for February March
9:57 April and May and and so on and you get
10:00 the idea not to mention the grand total
10:03 is wrong as well now if you build pivot
10:05 tables using data in this type of format
10:08 it can be very frustrating because
10:10 you're able to build what looks like a
10:12 working pivot table but it results in
10:15 lots of annoying issues that can leave
10:17 those new to Pivot tables completely
10:20 baffled to the point they end up
10:21 thinking pivot tables are
10:24 complicated another common problem
10:27 people run into is what I call the semi-
10:29 report layout this is where your data is
10:32 in a partial report format here you can
10:35 see this data has some nested column
10:37 labels spread over two rows it's already
10:40 being pivoted so the units and Order
10:43 amounts are in separate columns for the
10:44 different countries and there are
10:46 columns for the totals plus it has a
10:50 blank column smack bang in the middle of
10:52 it so you simply cannot build a pivot
10:55 table from this data remember you can't
10:58 have any blank columns and your column
11:00 labels must be in one row the correct
11:03 layout for this data looks like this
11:06 where you have a column for the country
11:07 label and then the units and Order
11:10 amounts are in a column each and from
11:12 here you can easily create the layout
11:14 shown in the semi report let's take a
11:17 look we'll insert a pivot table I'm
11:19 going to pop it here so that we can see
11:22 it beside the data now I'm just going to
11:24 hide this so that we have more room so I
11:28 want order date
11:30 and I don't want it grouped so I'm just
11:31 going to contrl zed to ungroup it
11:34 straight away then order ID
11:38 salesperson we want the countries across
11:40 the top and then I want to sum the units
11:43 and the order amounts now it's done some
11:46 nesting in the layout so if we go to the
11:48 design tab I'm going to choose tabular
11:52 format and we're going to turn off the
11:55 subtotals and there we have pretty much
11:58 exact L the same report as we see here
12:01 except created with a pivot table and I
12:05 can do things like repeat these labels
12:07 so right click field settings layout and
12:10 print repeat item labels and we can
12:13 spend a little bit of time formatting
12:15 the headings but for the most part it's
12:18 exactly the same report except now I can
12:21 do much more with the data because my
12:23 source data is in the correct
12:26 layout so you can see when your data is
12:29 formatted even slightly wrong it can
12:32 make building pivot tables difficult the
12:34 good news is that data in the wrong
12:36 format is easily fixed with power query
12:39 there's a video coming up next and a
12:42 link in the video description on how to
12:44 use power query to fix incorrect data
12:46 layouts using the unpivot tool so be
12:49 sure to check that out well I hope
12:52 you're excited to try building your own
12:54 pivot tables you can get started by
