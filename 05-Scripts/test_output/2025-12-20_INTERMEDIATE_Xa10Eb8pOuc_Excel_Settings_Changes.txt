==============================================================================

0:00 Raise your hand if Excel's default
settings have ever driven you just
0:04 a little bit crazy. Maybe it's those leading
zeros disappearing from your invoice numbers,
0:09 the GETPIVOTDATA function inserting itself
whenever you reference a PivotTable,
0:14 or that new Copilot icon following your every
move. You see, Excel's default settings are
0:19 built for the average user — but you and I,
we're not average. So, in this video, I'm going
0:25 to show you 15 simple but game-changing Excel
settings you absolutely need to change right now.
0:30 Watch the video carefully because I'll be sharing
a free resource you can open anytime you need a
0:35 quick reminder of these settings, so
you never need to Google them again.
0:39 You enter a phone number like 075551234
and Excel drops the leading zero. Now,
0:47 there are a few ways to prevent this. For one-off
entries, you can simply type an apostrophe,
0:52 then type the number and press Enter. And
this forces the format to become text. The
0:58 apostrophe isn't visible on the face of the
cell, but if you look in the formula bar,
1:02 you can see it there. Plus, we have the telltale
left alignment to indicate this is now text,
1:08 and Excel is warning you that this looks
like a number and it wants to convert
1:12 it. Obviously, we can just ignore
the error, and there's our number.
1:17 However, if you have a lot of numbers to enter
like this, having to enter an apostrophe first
1:21 is annoying. Instead, in later versions
of Excel, you can now turn this automatic
1:26 conversion off via the File tab, down at
the bottom — Options — and then under Data,
1:33 down at the bottom, we've got Automatic
Data Conversion, and simply uncheck "Remove
1:38 leading zeros and convert to a number".
Click OK. And now when I type it in,
1:44 it remains as I typed it. Again, we get
the warning, which we need to ignore.
1:49 Now, if you don't see that
option in your version of Excel,
1:52 the other option is to simply format the
cells as text, via the dropdown here at
1:57 the bottom — Text. Then when you type
in the number, it remains as I typed it.
2:02 Now, if you're entering phone numbers, you
might prefer to insert spaces to make them
2:06 easier to read. And you can do that by simply
typing in a space as you enter it. But that
2:12 requires extra typing, so the other option is
to create a custom number format. Ctrl + 1 to
2:18 open the formatting pane. On the Number tab,
at the bottom, we've got Custom. In here,
2:23 simply type in zeros with spaces that represent
the numbers in your phone number. Click OK. And
2:30 now, if I type it in with no spaces, Excel
automatically adds them for me. Notice also
2:37 that this is a number, and if we look in the
formula bar, you can see it's dropped the zero,
2:42 but it's padded with a zero at the front
because of the custom number format. So,
2:46 you just need to decide which format of
number is going to work best for you.
2:50 If you work with data in Tables, you'll have
likely seen a formula like this and thought,
2:55 "Wait, what is this sorcery?" When you reference
cells in Tables, Excel automatically uses the
3:02 Table Structured References. Personally, I love
them — but if you find them confusing or annoying,
3:07 you'll be pleased to know that you can
turn them off in the Options settings.
3:11 Now, another way we can access the Options is
using the keyboard shortcuts Alt F T Here, we want
3:19 the Formulas tab, and we want to deselect "Use
table names in formulae". Click OK. And now if
3:26 I type in my SUM formula and reference the Profit
column, you can see it puts in the cell references
3:32 rather than the Table Structured Reference.
It returns the same result, so happy days.
3:38 You build a beautiful dashboard or summary
report, but those light grey gridlines make it
3:43 look unfinished. To turn them off, go to the
View tab, and then deselect Gridlines. Now,
3:49 if you want to go the extra mile, head to the
Page Layout tab and click on Background. Here,
3:55 you can browse to a custom background
file to really make your report pop.
4:00 Your reports instantly look more
professional and intentional — clean visuals,
4:06 better first impressions, especially when
sharing files with clients or your boss.
4:10 You're typing the same long phrases or technical
terms over and over, like "Quarterly Revenue
4:17 Report" or "My Online Training Hub". It's tedious
and typos sneak in when you least expect them.
4:24 If we open up the Options — remember, the
shortcut is Alt F T — and then under Proofing,
4:31 we can go into AutoCorrect Options, and here
we can create our own shortcuts. For example,
4:38 I'm going to replace "RR" with "Quarterly
Revenue Report". Click Add. Let's do the
4:45 same for "My Online Training Hub". We're going to
shorten it to "MOTH". Click Add. Click OK and OK.
4:52 Now, when I type in "MOTH", it automatically
puts in "My Online Training Hub". "RR" gives me
4:58 "Quarterly Revenue Report". It's like having
custom keyboard shortcuts — less typing,
5:03 fewer typos, and way more efficiency, especially
if you work with repetitive names or phrases.
5:09 A quick pause — if you're watching this and
thinking, "Okay, these settings are great, but
5:14 I still feel like I'm just scratching the surface
with Excel." You're not alone. A lot of people get
5:19 stuck trying to piece things together with YouTube
videos and random Googling — and it just takes
5:24 forever. That's actually why I created my Excel
Expert course. It's everything I wish I had when I
5:30 was learning Excel — structured lessons, hands-on,
files to practice with, and guidance when you need
5:36 it to help you stop guessing and actually feel
confident with the powerful stuff in Excel.
5:41 So, if you want to go beyond the settings
and really upgrade your skills — whether
5:46 it's for your job, a promotion, or just to
finally feel like the Excel expert on your
5:50 team — there's a link in the description and
pinned comment where you can check it out.
5:54 All right, let's get back to the settings.
5:58 If you're using the latest version
of Excel with Microsoft 365, you may
6:02 have noticed the new Copilot icon popping up
all the time, even when you're not using it.
6:08 It's visually distracting and gets
in the way. Luckily, in the Options,
6:13 we have a new Copilot tab. So, Alt F T — Copilot.
Here we can check the box to "Show Copilot
6:20 icon only for highly relevant suggestions". Click
OK. And now it's gone — thank goodness. Of course,
6:28 you can still use Copilot — it's available on the
Home tab, over on the far right. Click on it, and
6:33 it brings up the Copilot task pane. So, it's not
gone for good — it's just not annoying anymore.
6:38 Every time you insert a PivotTable,
Excel defaults to the Compact Layout,
6:43 so you waste time switching to Tabular Layout,
turning off Subtotals, etc., just to get the
6:49 layout you actually want. So, to fix this, we'll
go back into Options — Alt F T. On the Data tab,
6:56 we've got "Make changes to the default layout
of PivotTables". Edit the default layout. And
7:02 here we can import a layout. So, I can just import
this one that I've already set up the way I want,
7:07 or you can use the dropdowns here to choose
the different settings if you want something
7:12 slightly different. We can also access the
PivotTable Options, where there are some
7:16 further settings that we can set as the default.
I'm going to import this one. Click OK and OK.
7:23 And now let's clear this PivotTable. We'll go and
insert another PivotTable — I want Country in the
7:29 columns, Segment, Product, and Units Sold. And
just like that, it's picked up my default layout.
7:35 By the way, if you have Microsoft 365, you'll
notice the PivotTable value fields now inherit
7:40 the number formatting of the source data. So we
can see there's our Units Sold column — it's set
7:46 to comma separator with no zeros. And if we look
at the PivotTable, it's picked it up — perfect.
7:52 If you work with PivotTables, you'll no
doubt have referenced a cell in a PivotTable,
7:56 and instead of a normal cell reference like I5,
we get the cumbersome GETPIVOTDATA function. Let's
8:03 say we want to calculate this as a percentage of
the grand total. We'll format it as a percentage,
8:09 and then we copy it down. And what happens? We get
the same result on every row. And that's because
8:14 the formula is hard-keyed — which is a pain.
The good news is we can turn this setting off.
8:21 Simply select the PivotTable. On the PivotTable
Analyze tab, on the far left we've got Options,
8:27 and we can deselect "Generate GETPIVOTDATA". Now,
if I type in my formula, you can see we get the
8:33 regular cell reference, and I can easily
copy it down to get my results — perfect.
8:42 That said, there are a lot of benefits to
using GETPIVOTDATA, which I cover in the
8:47 video linked in the description. So I recommend
you give it a chance and check out the video.
8:52 If you're using the latest version of
Excel with all the fancy new functions,
8:56 and you share your file with someone on an older
version, they'll get a nasty surprise if they try
9:01 to edit a formula or they trigger a recalculation.
So, to avoid this, you can make sure your files
9:07 are backward compatible via the File tab — Info —
and then under "Inspect Workbook", we can "Check
9:13 for Issues" and "Check Compatibility". We get
this dialogue box, and we can click here and
9:20 choose the versions of Excel that we want to check
backward compatibility for. I only want to go back
9:26 as far as 2019, and you can see we've got a few
issues. It tells us the location, the sheet name,
9:34 we can click on Find and it will take us to
the cell or object that's the issue. We can
9:39 also click on the Help link to understand more
about it and what alternate options you have.
9:44 We can "Check compatibility when saving this
workbook", and if you have a lot of issues,
9:49 you might find copying them to a new sheet handy,
because then you can work through them one by one.
9:55 You copy one thing, and Excel forgets the last
thing you copied. And if you need to paste several
10:00 things into different places, you can waste a lot
of time flipping back and forth. The solution?
10:06 Let me show you. Go to the Home tab, click on
the little launch icon here in the bottom-right
10:11 corner of the Clipboard group — and this opens
the Clipboard. It can store up to 24 copied items.
10:18 For example, I've broken a long formula
into steps to make it easier to write.
10:23 Now I'm happy it calculates correctly, I want to
consolidate these three formulas into one. So,
10:28 I'm going to select the first one — including
equals — Ctrl + C to copy. It's now on the
10:33 Clipboard. Escape. Let's go to the next one
— I only need up to the equal sign for this
10:39 one — Ctrl + C. Escape. And the last one
— again, just up to the equal sign. So,
10:45 now we've got the three components of my
formula. I can go to the cell that I want
10:50 to paste them in. In the formula bar, click
on each element. So, I want this formula,
10:56 and then I'm subtracting the WEEKDAY, and
instead of referencing step 2's formula,
11:02 I'm going to insert this one. Press Enter. And now
I get my formula consolidated into one. And the
11:10 Clipboard has made it super quick and easy for me
to copy those different elements of the formula.
11:15 Now, the nice thing about the Clipboard is you
can copy text or images from other Office apps,
11:20 your web browser, wherever — and they'll
be available for you to paste as required.
11:26 If you're using Excel for labels or templates or
anything design-related, the default ruler units
11:32 might not match what you need. First of all, you
need to turn the ruler on, and we do that via the
11:37 View tab, and we want the Page Layout view. You
also need to make sure that in the Show group,
11:42 Ruler is checked — and we can see it at the
top of the screen there. The column width and
11:47 row height are now in your default units. If
I right-click and edit the column width, you
11:52 can see my default unit is "centimetres", but we
can change the units via the File tab — Options.
11:58 Let's use the keyboard shortcut, and then under
Advanced, I'm going to scroll down to the Display
12:04 section. And here we've got Ruler Units. I've got
my default units set, but I can choose inches,
12:10 centimetres, or millimetres. I'm going to leave it
at my default, 'cause that's perfect for my needs.
12:16 If you want to turn the ruler off, you
can simply deselect it here — or going
12:21 back to Normal View will just display
the regular row and column labels.
12:26 If you open the same Excel files every single day,
you waste precious minutes hunting them down and
12:31 opening them manually. Instead, set them up to
automatically open when you start Excel. Simply
12:38 place them all in a folder together, then copy the
path to that folder. You can right-click and "Copy
12:44 as Path", or you can see the keyboard shortcut is
Ctrl + Shift + C. Once you've got the folder path
12:50 copied, go back to Excel, go into your Options —
Alt F T — then under Advanced, scroll all the way
12:57 to the bottom, and then under the General group,
we've got "At startup, open all files in". And
13:03 Ctrl + V to paste in your folder path. Now, you'll
notice there's double quotes surrounding it — so
13:08 delete them. Go to the front and delete that one
as well. Click OK. And next time you open Excel,
13:15 it's going to open all the files in that folder
— ready for action without any extra clicks.
13:21 When you type in a website or email address,
Excel instantly turns it into a clickable
13:26 blue hyperlink. That might be what you
want, but if not, it just looks messy,
13:31 replaces your formatting, and if you're
working with raw data, it's just not helpful.
13:36 To turn this default off, go to the Options
— Alt F T — and then under Proofing,
13:42 we've got AutoCorrect Options, and
then under "AutoFormat As You Type",
13:46 we've got "Internet and network paths
with hyperlinks". Deselect that. Click OK,
13:52 and OK. And now, when you type in your URL, web
address, or email address, it won't convert them.
14:00 If you work with objects like shapes or icons or
images — like these ones here — that are layered
14:06 on top of one another, it can be frustrating
selecting them one by one, especially if they're
14:11 overlapping. Instead, on the Home tab under Find
& Select, you can convert your mouse to Select
14:18 Objects mode. Then you can left-click and drag to
select objects — you can move them around as one.
14:25 You simply have to enclose the whole
object to ensure you've grabbed all of it.
14:30 To exit Select Objects mode, you can go back
to Find & Select and click it again — or you
14:36 can just press Escape, and now your mouse is
back to normal. Now, another shortcut if you
14:41 just want to select all objects on your page is to
select one, and then Ctrl + A to select them all.
14:48 If you use the Edge browser, you may have noticed
that it defaults to opening Excel files in Excel
14:53 for the web — which is super annoying if your
file contains features that aren't available
14:57 in Excel Online yet. To fix this in Microsoft
Edge, click on the ellipsis in the top right,
15:04 go into Settings, and then on the left, select
Downloads. And here, turn off "Open Office files
15:13 in the browser". This tells Edge not to open
Excel, Word, or PowerPoint files in the browser,
15:19 but to download them instead — letting
you open them in the desktop app.
15:24 If you work with large spreadsheets, the
Focus Cell feature — available to Microsoft
15:28 365 users — highlights the row and column of
the selected cell, making it easier to trace
15:34 data across large ranges. You activate it on
the View tab, and then Focus Cell. And now,
15:40 wherever you click, it's going to be easy
to see at a glance — highlighting the active
15:46 row and column of your selected cell. You
can also select a color of your choice
15:51 via the dropdown here — you can see we
have the whole palette to choose from.
15:55 You'll notice there's also "Show auto highlight".
Let me demonstrate how that works. We'll turn
16:00 Focus Cell off, and then if I Ctrl + F to use
the Find dialog box, and we'll find "Paseo",
16:07 Find Next — it enables Focus Cell when in Find
mode, making it easy to see the selected cell in
16:14 your worksheet. Once you go out of the Find
dialog box, you can see Focus Cell is off.
16:20 Excel is now finally set up to work for you — not
against you. And like I promised at the beginning,
16:26 you don't need to remember all these
settings — I've put together a free
16:29 cheat sheet with everything we covered
today. You can keep it to hand as a
16:33 quick reference guide — and the link's
in the description and pinned comment.
16:38 If you want to take things a step further and
make your most-used tools just one click away,
16:43 check out this video next on a totally underrated
16:46 Excel feature that can save you a
ton of time. I'll see you there.
