0:02 hi I'm minda Tracy from my online training Hub in this video we're going
0:05 to get you up and running with Excel slices and once you see them in action
0:07 you'll wonder how you lived without them
0:11 now I've created an Excel file that you can download and keep and that's got
0:13 step-by-step instructions for everything covered here so don't worry if I cover
0:15 things quickly because I've taken notes for you and you're welcome to share that
0:19 file with your colleagues too now there's a link under the video where you
0:21 can download the workbook and I'll put it up at the end of the video as well
0:25 okay so slices are available for pivot tables in excel20 onwards and they also
0:27 work with tables from Excel 2013 onwards now slices allow you to quickly
0:33 and easily filter tables and pivot tables with just the click or click and
0:36 drag of buttons and they float above the grid they're objects so they're easily
0:40 movable and aligned and they're not to the cells on your worksheet they
0:44 visually indicate items that are selected as you can see here and if I
0:47 select bikes you can see the subcategory now has these grade out buttons which
0:50 indicates data that's not available for that particular category we've got scroll bars that
0:56 enable you to scroll through the list and they're inserted by default based on
1:00 the size of the slicer slices for pivot tables can filter more than one pivot
1:02 table as you can see here here I've got a pivot table here and one right beside
1:08 let me zoom out a little bit so you can see it easier so as I select States you can see
1:14 both pivot tables respond based on the selections that I've made in the slices
1:18 and also notice that as I continue to filter the slic selections are additive
1:21 so I can drill down into my data and filter out all the noise that I don't
1:25 want to see by continually selecting more and more buttons in my slices now
1:29 with slices for tables first of all you need to format your data in a table so
1:32 if it's not formatted in a table select a cell in the table range or all of the
1:36 data and then contrl T will insert the table formatting and now you can apply a
1:44 slicer to that table so inserting slices is pretty
1:49 quick and easy and as with most things in Excel there are lots of ways to
1:52 approach this one option is with the table or pivot table selected on the
1:56 contextual tab you can see here I've got insert slicer if I'm on a pivot table I
2:01 also have the contextual tab and you'll see insert slicer but you'll also find insert
2:08 slicer on the insert tab first of all make sure you've got the pivot table or
2:12 table selected that you want to insert as slicer four click on the slicer
2:16 button you get the list of all of the fields and from here we can select
2:20 multiple slices to insert and then click okay I can move them around I can click
2:27 and drag the outer edge to resize them and if I choose not to use that slicer
2:32 with it selected on the Outer Edge I can press the delete key and get rid of them
2:36 now the other way to insert a slicer that is available in Excel 2013 onwards
2:42 is in your field list you can right click a field and then add as
2:47 slicer and that will give you one slicer at a time you can't insert multiple
2:51 slices with that method I'll delete that one now the great thing about using
2:55 slices is they're quite intuitive so as you saw we can left click a button we
3:00 can left click and drag to select multiple contiguous buttons or items we
3:05 can left click and then hold down control to select noncontiguous items or
3:10 we can left click hold down shift and then click the last to select a range of
3:15 items and we have this clear filters button at the top in Excel 2016 we have
3:21 this multi- select option here and this changes the behavior of the single
3:25 button click so that each click adds or deselects an item and this is really
3:30 ideal for touchscreen use in Excel when you're using it on your desktop top it's
3:35 more intuitive to leave multi select off but that is an option for XL 2016 so
3:41 let's look at our formatting options for slices with a slicer selected we get the
3:46 contextual slicer tools Tab and here we can change the caption on the slicer we can access the slicer settings
3:53 which I'll cover in a moment and Report connections also in a moment we can set
3:58 our slic style so maybe we want them to be a different color and there's a whole
4:03 gallery that we can choose from we can even create our own slicer
4:07 style because these are objects we have the arrange tools so we can align slices
4:12 if you hold down shift and select multiple slices then you can use the
4:17 Align tools we can also group them so they're easy to move around as though
4:22 they're one object I'll undo that so I can make some more changes and show you
4:27 some more of the setting we can change the number of columns so
4:32 you can see my year slicer has two columns and I can increase that as I
4:37 want we can also alter the button height and the width of the slicer
4:43 buttons we can alter the overall height using the height adjuster and the width
4:49 or we can just use our pull handles to roughly size them how we want we can cut
4:54 them and move them so the slicer doesn't have to be on the sheet that your pivot
4:59 tables on so with the slices selected I can contrl X to cut it out and I could
5:05 pop it on a completely different sheet I could still use it here if I select 2015
5:10 and go back to my pivot table you can see my data is now filtered for 2015 so
5:16 slices are independent of the sheet that the pivot table is actually on so let me
5:21 pop it back in here we can also hold down alt when
5:26 we're moving it around and that will snap the slicer to the grid
5:30 and align it to the cells underneath or if we hold down shift when
5:36 we move the slicer then it will stay aligned vertically or horizontally
5:39 depending on the direction you're moving it in another great shortcut is if you want
5:45 to select all slices with one selected crl a will select them all now crl a
5:51 will select all objects on your sheet so if you have other charts or images then
5:57 controller a will select them as well so may not always be suitable but it is a
7:01 shortcut if you're just working with slices and you might want to select them
7:05 all and change them all to a particular color in one go now another thing I like to do when
7:12 I'm producing a report for other users is to set the properties of the slicer
7:18 so that when you click on it it doesn't activate the pool handles if you click
7:23 the buttons it's okay but if you miss that button the pull handles on the
7:27 slicer become activated and it looks like it's in edit mode so to prevent
7:32 that from happening you can right click and then go into size and properties and
7:36 then under position and layout select disable resizing and moving you can see
7:40 the pull handles are now gone I can still work with the slicer but now if I click the outer edge
7:48 I can't move it it doesn't look like it's in edit mode so let me undo that
7:52 because I want to show you how to manage the slicer connections so as I said
7:57 slices can connect to more than one pivot table and that means you can
8:01 control the filtering on multiple pivot tables with a single slicer to control
8:06 the pivot tables that that slicer is connected to we can right click on the
8:10 slicer and then go into report connections if you're using Excel 201010
8:15 then this will say pivot table connections but it's in the same
8:18 position in this list so in here I have a list of all the pivot tables in my
8:21 file and the sheets that they're on and I can check the boxes for the pivot
8:27 tables that I want this particular slicer to filter so if I wanted it to
8:31 also filter the slices on the insert slices sheet then I can check those
8:35 boxes now it's always a good idea to give your pivot tables recognizable
8:40 names and that will help you identify them when you're working with the BR
8:43 Port connections so try and avoid the generic pivot table default names if you
8:48 can an easy way to rename your pivot table is to rightclick on any cell and
8:54 then go into pivot table options and up here you can pop in a new
8:59 name you'll also find that on the pivot table tools tab in the pivot table name
9:04 box up here now if a pivot table isn't in your report connections list and
9:09 you'd expect it to be then it will suggest that the problem with that pivot
9:13 table is it doesn't share the same pivot cache as the pivot table that this
9:18 slicer is connected to so a pivot table cache is created when you insert a pivot
9:24 table Excel takes a copy of the data and it holds it in memory and that's called
9:31 the pivot cache in order for a pivot table to share the pivot cache of
9:36 another pivot table it has to use that same Source data so if you have two
9:42 different sheets with different data on it and you've created two pivot tables
9:47 from each of those sheets then those pivot tables won't share the same pivot
9:51 cache and you can't use one slice to control them the only way to do that is
9:56 to use power pivot or the data model to create one cache so if your pivot table's not in
10:06 this list and you'd expect it to be because it shares the same Source data
10:11 then you'll need to recreate that pivot table that's missing from the list and
10:15 the way I suggest to do that is to copy an existing pivot table that is in your
10:20 list of connections and then modify that that will ensure that they share the
10:25 same pivot cache now in the file that you can download with this video I've
10:30 got some more information on the pivot cache so you can learn about that now
10:34 the last thing I want to cover are the slicer settings so let's rightclick the
10:38 slicer and go into slicer settings here we can change the name for the slicer
10:43 although that doesn't really have much effect it doesn't it's not visible in
10:47 the slicer itself the name up here on the slice of header is altered here so
10:53 we can change the caption or we can remove that header Al together and if I
10:57 remove that header then the caption the multi selector and the clear filters
11:00 will be removed so you might want to consider that carefully cuz not being
11:05 able to remove the filters in one go may be inconvenient if you have lots of
11:09 items in your slicer the other thing we can do is
11:14 Alter the sort order and if you want to sort them in a particular order other
11:19 than alphabetically then you can use a custom list to sort them here we can
11:22 hide items with no data so let me click okay there you can see my header's gone
11:29 but if I select an item in this slicer you can see my items with no data are
11:32 grade out so if I edit my slicer settings for this slicer and choose to hide items with no
11:39 data then these items will not be in the list let's click okay so now you can see
11:44 it appears like I only have three subcategories and that's because I
11:47 filtered bikes if I choose clothing I get a different list back in the slic of
11:53 settings is one more thing instead of hiding items with no data then the
11:56 default is to visually indicate items with no data by graying out the buttons
12:01 and it will show items with no data last this last one here show items deleted
12:08 from the data source if your Source data changes and say you no longer have a
12:14 category for bikes by default bikes will still be included in the slicer but it
12:19 will be gray out because we've got visually indicate items with no data now
12:24 I personally don't think there's any point in showing items that are deleted
12:29 from the data source still in the slice I think that's a bit confusing so I like
12:33 to deselect that and click okay so that is slices in a nutshell have some fun
12:38 with them I'm sure your users will love how intuitive they are and don't forget
